on apriu°orjy°nopyeico.fore, these two eminent servants of God were parted
asunder, and never appear to have travelled together any more. They
continued however each to serve in the cause of Christ, though they
could not walk together. Barnabas took John, and sailed to Cyprus, his
native island, and Paul took Silas, and went through Syria and Cilicia
to Derbe and Lystra, cities where he and Barnabas had preached in
their first excursion.

Here they found Timothy, a promising young man, whom they encouraged
to engage in the ministry.

Paul being now at Lystra, which was the boundary of his first
excursion, and having visited the churches already planted, and
delivered to them the decrees of the apostles and elders relating to
circumcision, seems to have felt his heart enlarged, and assayed to
carry on the glorious work of preaching the gospel to the heathen to a
greater extent. With Silas and Timotheus he in his second journey[2]
took a western direction, passing through Phrygia, and the region of
Galatia. Having preached the word in these parts with considerable
success,[3] he and his companions wished to have gone into the
proconsular Asia, and afterwards assayed to go into Bythinia; but
begin forbidden of the Holy Ghost, who seems to have had a special
design of employing them elsewhere; passing by Mysia they came down to
Troas on the sea-coast. Here a vision appeared to Paul, in which he
was invited to go over to Macedonia. Obedient to the heavenly vision,
and greatly encouraged by it, they with all speed crossed the Egean
Sea, and passing through the island of Samothracia, landed at
Neapolis, and went from thence to Philippi, the chief city of that
part of Macedonia. It was here that Paul preached on a Sabbath day to
a few women by a river side, and Lydia, a woman of Thyatira, was
converted and baptized, and her household with her. It was here that a
poor girl, who brought her employers considerable profit by
foretelling events, followed the apostles, had her spirit of
divination ejected, on which account her masters were much irritated,
and raised a tumult, the effect of which was, that Paul and Silas were
imprisoned. But even this was over-ruled for the success of the
gospel, in that the keeper of the prison, and all his house, were
thereby brought to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and were
baptized.

[Footnote 2: The account of this second journey into the heathen world
begins at Acts xv. 40. and ends chap. xviii. 22.]

[Footnote 3: See ch. xviii. 23. and Gal i. 2.]

From Philippi they passed thorough Amphipolis, Apollonia,
Thessalonica, (now Salonichi,) Berea, Athens, and Corinth, preaching
the gospel wherever they went. From hence Paul took ship and sailed to
Syria, only giving a short call at Ephesus, determining to be at
Jerusalem at the feast of the passover; and having saluted the church,
he came to Cesarea, and from thence to Antioch.

Here ended Paul's second journey, which was very extensive, and took
up some years of his time. He and his companions met with their
difficulties in it, but had likewise their encouragements. They were
persecuted at Philippi, as already noticed, and generally found the
Jews to be their most inveterate enemies. These would raise tumults,
inflame the minds of the gentiles against them, and follow them from
place to place, doing them all the mischief in their power. This was
the case especially at Thessalonica, Berea, and Corinth. But amidst
all their persecutions God was with them, and strengthened them in
various ways. At Berea they were candidly received, and their doctrine
fairly tried by the Holy Scriptures; and _therefore_, it is said,
_many of them believed_. At other places, though they affected to
despise the apostle, yet some clave unto him. At _Corinth_ opposition
rose to a great height; but the Lord appeared to his servant in a
vision, saying, _Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace, for
I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee; for I have
much people in this city_. And the promise was abundantly made good in
the spirit discovered by Gallio, the proconsul, who turned a deaf ear
to the accusations of the jews, and nobly declined interfering in
matters beside his province. Upon the whole a number of churches were
planted during this journey, which for ages after shone as lights in
the world.

When Paul had visited Antioch, and spent some time there, he prepared
for a third journey into heathen countries, the account of which
begins Acts xviii. 23. and ends chap. xxi. 17. At his first setting
out he went over the whole country of Galatia and Phrygia in order,
strengthening all the disciples; and passing through the upper coasts
came to Ephesus. There for the space of three months, he boldly
preached in the jewish synagogue, disputing, and persuading the things
concerning the kingdom of God. But when the hardened jews had openly
rejected the gospel, and spake evil of that way before the multitude,
Paul openly separated the disciples from them, and assembled in the
school of one Tyrannus. This, it is said, continued for the space of
two years, _so that all they who dwelt in_ the proconsular _Asia heard
the word of the Lord Jesus, both jews and greeks_. Certain magicians,
about this time were exposed, and others converted, who burnt their
books, and confessed their deeds. So mightily grew the word of the
Lord, and prevailed.

After this an uproar being raised by Demetrius, the silversmith, Paul
went into Macedonia, visited the churches planted in his former
journey, and from thence passed into Greece. Having preached up and
down for three months, he thought of sailing from thence directly to
Syria; but in order to avoid the jews, who laid wait for him near the
sea coast, he took another course through Macedonia, and from thence
to Troas, by the way of Philippi. There is no mention made in his
former journey of his having preached at Troas; yet it seems he did,
and a church was gathered, with whom the apostle at this time united
in _breaking of bread_. It was here that he preached all night, and
raised Eutychus, who being overcome with sleep, had fallen down, and
was taken up dead. From hence they set sail for Syria, and in their
way called at Miletus, where Paul sent for the elders of the church of
Ephesus, and delivered that most solemn and affectionate farewell,
recorded in the 20th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles. From hence
they sailed for Tyre, where they tarried seven days, and from thence
proceeded to Jerusalem.

Paul's fourth and last journey (or rather voyage) was to Rome, where
he went in the character of a prisoner. For being at Jerusalem he was
quickly apprehended by the jews; but being rescued by Lysias, the
chief captain, he was sent to Cesarea to take his trial. Here he made
his defence before Felix and Drusilla, in such sort that the judge,
instead of the prisoner, was made to tremble.  Here also he made his
defence before Festus, Agrippa, and Bernice, with such force of
evidence that Agrippa was almost persuaded to be a Christian. But the
malice of the jews being insatiable, and Paul finding himself in
danger of being delivered into their hands, was constrained to appeal
unto Caesar. This was the occasion of his being sent to Rome, where he
arrived after a long and dangerous voyage, and being shipwrecked on
the island of Melita, where he wrought miracles, and Publius, the
governor, was converted.

When he arrived at Rome he addressed his countrymen the jews, some of
whom believed; but when others rejected the gospel, he turned from
them to the gentiles, and for two whole years dwelt in his own hired
house preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which
concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding
him.

Thus far the history of the Acts of the Apostles informs us of the
success of the word in the primitive times; and history informs us of
its being preached about this time, in many other places. Peter speaks
of a church at Babylon; Paul proposed a journey to Spain, and it is
generally believed he went there, and likewise came to France and
Britain. Andrew preached to the Scythians, north of the Black Sea.
John is said to have preached in India, and we know that he was at the
Isle of Patmos, in the Archipelago. Philip is reported to have
preached in upper Asia, Scythia, and Phrygia; Bartholomew in India, on
this side the Ganges, Phrygia, and Armenia; Matthew in Arabia, or
Asiatic Ethiopia, and Parthia; Thomas in India, as far as the coast of
Coromandel, and some say in the island of Ceylon; Simon, the
Canaanite, in Egypt, Cyrene, Mauritania, Lybia, and other parts of
Africa, and from thence to have come to Britain; and Jude is said to
have been principally engaged in the lesser Asia, and Greece. Their
labours were evidently very extensive, and very successful; so that
Pliny, the younger, who lived soon after the death of the apostles, in
a letter to the emperor, Trajan, observed that Christianity had
spread, not only through towns and cities, but also through whole
countries. Indeed before this, in the time of Nero, it was so
prevalent that it was thought necessary to oppose it by an Imperial
Edict, and accordingly the proconsuls, and other governors, were
commissioned to destroy it.

Justin Martyr, who lived about the middle of the second century, in
his dialogue with Trypho, observed that there was no part of mankind,
whether greeks or barbarians, or any others, by what name soever they
were called, whether the Sarmatians, or the Nomades, who had no
houses, or the Scenites of Arabia Petrea, who lived in tents among
their cattle, where supplications and thanksgivings are not offered up
to the Father, and maker of all things, through the name of Jesus
Christ. Irenaeus, who lived about the year 170, speaks of churches
that were founded in Germany, Spain, France, the eastern countries,
Egypt, Lybia, and the middle of the world. Tertullian, who lived and
wrote at Carthage in Africa, about twenty years afterwards,
enumerating the countries where Christianity had penetrated, makes
mention of the Parthians, Medes, Elamites, Mesopotamians, Armenians,
Phrygians, Cappadocians, the inhabitants of Pontus, Asia, Pamphylia,
Egypt, and the regions of Africa beyond Cyrene, the Romans, and Jews,
formerly of Jerusalem, many of the Getuli, many borders of the Mauri,
or Moors, in Mauritania; now Barbary, Morocco, &c. all the borders of
Spain, many nations of the Gauls, and the places in Britain which were
inaccessible to the Romans; the Dacians, Sarmatians, Germans,
Scythians, and the inhabitants of many hidden nations and provinces,
and of many islands unknown to him, and which he could not enumerate.
The labours of the ministers of the gospel, in this early period, were
so remarkably blessed of God, that the last mentioned writer observed,
in a letter to Scapula, that if he began a persecution the city of
Carthage itself must be decimated thereby. Yea, and so abundant were
they in the three first centuries, that ten years constant and almost
universal persecution under Dioclesian, could neither root out the
Christians, nor prejudice their cause.

After this they had great encouragement under several emperors,
particularly Constantine and Theodosius, and a very great work of God
was carried on; but the ease and affluence which in these times
attended the church, served to introduce a flood of corruption, which
by degrees brought on the whole system of popery, by means of which
all appeared to be lost again; and Satan set up his kingdom of
darkness, deceit, and human authority over conscience, through all the
Christian world.

In the time of Constantine, one Frumentius was sent to preach to the
Indians, and met with great success. A young woman who was a
Christian, being taken captive by the Iberians, or Georgians, near the
Caspian Sea, informed them of the truths of Christianity, and was so
much regarded that they sent to Constantine for ministers to come and
preach the word to them. About the same time some barbarous nations
having made irruptions into Thrace, carried away several Christians
captive, who preached the gospel; by which means the inhabitants upon
the Rhine, and the Danube, the Celtae, and some other parts of Gaul,
were brought to embrace Christianity. About this time also James of
Nisbia, went into Persia to strengthen the Christians, and preach to
the heathens; and his success was so great that Adiabene was almost
entirely Christian. About the year 372, one Moses, a Monk, went to
preach to the Saracens, who then lived in Arabia, where he had great
success; and at this time the Goths, and other northern nations, had
the kingdom of Christ further extended amongst them, but which was
very soon corrupted with Arianism.

Soon after this the kingdom of Christ was further extended among the
Scythian Nomades, beyond the Danube, and about the year 430, a people
called the Burgundians, received the gospel. Four years after, that
Palladius was sent to preach in Scotland, and the next year Patrick
was sent from Scotland to preach to the Irish who before his time were
totally uncivilized, and, some say, cannibals; he however, was useful,
and laid the foundations of several churches in Ireland. Presently
after this, truth spread further among the Saracens, and in 522,
Zathus, king of the Colchians encouraged it, and many of that nation
were converted to Christianity. About this time also the work was
extended in Ireland, by Finian, and in Scotland by Constantine and
Columba; the latter of whom preached also to the Picts, and Brudaeus,
their king, with several others, were converted. About 541, Adad, the
king of Ethiopia, was converted by the preaching of Mansionarius; the
Heruli beyond the Danube, were now made obedient to the faith, and the
Abasgi, near the Caucasian Mountains.

But now popery, especially the compulsive part of it, was risen to
such an height, that the usual method of propagating the gospel, or
rather what was so called, was to conquer pagan nations by force of
arms, and then oblige them to submit to Christianity, after which
bishopricks were erected, and persons then sent to instruct the
people. I shall just mention some of those who are said to have
laboured thus.

In 596, Austin, the monk, Melitus, Justus, Paulinus, and Russinian,
laboured in England, and in their way were very successful. Paulinus,
who appears to have been one of the best of them, had great success in
Northumberland; Birinnius preached to the West Saxons, and Felix to
the East Angles. In 589, Amandus Gallus laboured in Ghent, Chelenus in
Artois, and Gallus and Columbanus in Suabia. In 648, Egidius Gallus in
Flanders, and the two Evaldi, in Westphalia. In 684, Willifred, in the
Isle of Wight. In 688, Chilianus, in upper Franconia. In 698,
Boniface, or Winifred, among the Thuringians, near Erford, in Saxony,
and Willibroad in West-Friesland. Charlemagne conquered Hungary in the
year 800, and obliged the inhabitants to profess Christianity, when
Modestus likewise preached to the Venedi, at the source of the Save
and Drave. In 833, Ansgarius preached in Denmark, Gaudibert in Sweden,
and about 861, Methodius and Cyril, in Bohemia.

About the year 500, the Scythians over-run Bulgaria, and Christianity
was extirpated; but about 870 they were re-converted. Poland began to
be brought over about the same time, and afterwards, about 960 or 990,
the work was further extended amongst the Poles and Prussians. The
work was begun in Norway in 960, and in Muscovy in 989, the Swedes
propagated Christianity in Finland, in 1168, Lithuania became
Christian in 1386, and Samogitia in 1439. The Spaniards forced popery
upon the inhabitants of South-America, and the Portuguese in Asia.
The Jesuits were sent into China in 1552. Xavier, whom they call the
apostle of the Indians, laboured in the East-Indies and Japan, from
1541 to 1552, and several millions of Capauchins were sent to Africa
in the seventeenth century. But blind zeal, gross superstition, and
infamous cruelties, so marked the appearances of religion all this
time, that the professors of Christianity needed conversion, as much
as the heathen world.

A few pious people had fled from the general corruption, and lived
obscurely in the vallies of Piedmont and Savoy, who were like the seed
of the church. Some of them were now and then necessitated to travel
into other parts, where they faithfully testified against the
corruptions of the times. About 1369 Wickliffe began to preach the
faith in England, and his preaching and writings were the means of the
conversion of great numbers, many of whom became excellent preachers;
and a work was begun which afterwards spread in England, Hungary,
Bohemia, Germany, Switzerland, and many other places. John Huss and
Jerom of Prague, preached boldly and successfully in Bohemia, and the
adjacent parts. In the following century Luther, Calvin, Melancton,
Bucer, Martyr, and many others, stood up against all the rest of the
world; they preached, and prayed, and wrote; and nations agreed one
after another to cast off the yoke of popery, and to embrace the
doctrine of the gospel.

In England, episcopal tyranny succeeded to popish cruelty, which, in
the year 1620, obliged many pious people to leave their native land
and settle in America; these were followed by others in 1629, who laid
the foundations of several gospel churches, which have increased
amazingly since that time, and the Redeemer has fixed his throne in
that country, where but a little time ago, Satan had universal
dominion.

In 1632, Mr. Elliot, of New-England, a very pious and zealous
minister, began to preach to the Indians, among whom he had great
success; several churches of Indians were planted, and some preachers
and school-masters raised up amongst them; since which time others
have laboured amongst them with some good encouragement. About the
year 1743, Mr. David Brainerd was sent a missionary to some more
Indians, where he preached, and prayed, and after some time an
extraordinary work of conversion was wrought, and wonderful success
attended his ministry. And at this present time, Mr. Kirkland and Mr.
Sergeant are employed in the same good work, and God has considerably
blessed their labours.

In 1706, the king of Denmark sent a Mr. Ziegenbalg, and some others,
to Tranquebar, on the Coromandel coast in the East-Indies, who were
useful to the natives, so that many of the heathens were turned to the
Lord. The Dutch East-India Company likewise having extended their
commerce, built the city of Batavia, and a church was opened there;
and the Lord's Supper was administered for the first time, on the 3d
of January, 1621, by their minister James Hulzibos, from hence some
ministers were sent to Amboyna, who were very successful. A seminary
of learning was erected at Leyden, in which ministers and assistants
were educated, under the renowned _Walaeus_, and some years a great
number were sent to the East, at the Company's expence, so that in a
little time many thousands at Formosa, Malabar, Ternate,
Jaffanapatnam, in the town of Columba, at Amboyna, Java, Banda,
Macassar, and Malabar, embraced the religion of our Lord Jesus Christ.
The work has decayed in some places, but they now have churches in
Ceylon, Sumatra, Java, Amboyna, and some other of the spice islands,
and at the Cape of Good Hope, in Africa.

But none of the moderns have equalled the Moravian Brethren in this
good work; they have sent missions to Greenland, Labrador, and several
of the West-Indian Islands, which have been blessed for good. They
have likewise sent to Abyssinia, in Africa, but what success they have
had I cannot tell.

The late Mr. Wesley lately made an effort in the West-Indies, and some
of their ministers are now labouring amongst the Caribbs and Negroes,
and I have seen pleasing accounts of their success.




                              SECT. III.


       _Containing a Survey of the present State of the World._


In this survey I shall consider the world as divided, according to its
usual division, into four parts, _EUROPE, ASIA, AFRICA_, and
_AMERICA_, and take notice of the extent of the several countries,
their population, civilization, and religion. The article of religion
I shall divide into Christian, Jewish, Mahometan, and Pagan; and shall
now and then hint at the particular sect of them that prevails in the
places which I shall describe. The following Tables will exhibit a
more comprehensive view of what I propose, than any thing I can offer
on the subject.

This, as nearly as I can obtain information, is the state of the
world; though in many countries, as Turkey, Arabia, Great Tartary,
Africa, and America, except the United States, and most of the Asiatic
Islands, we have no accounts of the number of inhabitants, that can be
relied on. I have therefore only calculated the extent, and counted a
certain number on an average upon a square mile; in some countries
more, and in others less, according as circumstances determine. A few
general remarks upon it will conclude this section.

FIRST, the inhabitants of the world according to this calculation,
amount to about seven hundred and thirty-one millions; four hundred
and twenty millions of whom are still in pagan darkness; an hundred
and thirty millions the followers of Mahomet; an hundred millions
catholics; forty-four millions protestants; thirty millions of the
greek and armenian churches, and perhaps seven millions of jews. It
must undoubtedly strike every considerate mind, what a vast proportion
of the sons of Adam there are, who yet remain in the most deplorable
state of heathen darkness, without any means of knowing the true God,
except what are afforded them by the works of nature; and utterly
destitute of the knowledge of the gospel of Christ, or of any means of
obtaining it. In many of these countries they have no written
language, consequently no Bible, and are only led by the most childish
customs and traditions. Such, for instance, are all the middle and
back parts of North America,  the inland parts of South America, the
South-Sea Islands, New Holland, New Zealand, New Guinea; and I may add
Great Tartary, Siberia, Samojedia, and the other parts of Asia
contiguous to the frozen sea; the greatest part of Africa, the island
of Madagascar, and many places beside. In many of these parts also
they are cannibals, feeding upon the flesh of their slain enemies,
with the greatest brutality and eagerness. The truth of this was
ascertained, beyond a doubt, by the late eminent navigator, Cooke, of
the New Zealanders, and some of the inhabitants of the western coast
of America. Human sacrifices are also very frequently offered, so that
scarce a week elapses without instances of this kind. They are in
general poor, barbarous, naked pagans, as destitute of civilization,
as they are of true religion.

SECONDLY, barbarous as these poor heathens are, they appear to be as
capable of knowledge as we are; and in many places, at least, have
discovered uncommon genius and tractableness; and I greatly question
whether most of the barbarities practiced by them, have not originated
in some real or supposed affront, and are therefore, more properly,
acts of self-defence, than proofs of inhuman and blood-thirsty
dispositions.

THIRDLY, in other parts, where they have a written language, as in the
East-Indies, China, Japan, &c. they know nothing of the gospel. The
jesuits indeed once made many converts to popery among the Chinese;
but their highest aim seemed to be to obtain their good opinion; for
though the converts professed themselves Christians, yet they were
allowed to honour the image of CONFUCIUS their great law-giver; and at
length their ambitious intrigues brought upon them the displeasure of
government, which terminated in the suppression of the mission, and
almost, if not entirely, of the Christian name. It is also a
melancholy fact, that the vices of Europeans have been communicated
wherever they themselves have been; so that the religious state of
even heathens has been rendered worse by intercourse with them!

FOURTHLY, a very great proportion of Asia and Africa, with some part
of Europe, are _Mahometans_; and those in Persia, who are of the sect
of _Hali_, are the most inveterate enemies to the Turks; and they in
return abhor the Persians. The Africans are some of the most ignorant
of all the mahometans; especially the Arabs, who are scattered through
all the northern parts of Africa, and live upon the depredations which
they are continually making upon their neighbours.

FIFTHLY, in respect to those who bear the Christian name, a very great
degree of ignorance and immorality abounds amongst them. There are
Christians, so called, of the greek and armenian churches, in all the
mahometan countries; but they are, if possible, more ignorant and
vicious than the mahometans themselves. The Georgian Christians, who
are near the Caspian Sea, maintain themselves by selling their
neighbours, relations, and children, for slaves to the Turks and
Persians. And it is remarked, that if any of the greeks of Anatolia
turn  mussulmen, the Turks never set any store by them, on account of
their being so much noted for dissimulation and hypocrisy. It is well
known that most of the members of the greek church are very ignorant.
Papists also are in general ignorant of divine things, and very
vicious. Nor do the bulk of the church of England much exceed them,
either in knowledge or holiness; and many errors, and much looseness
of conduct, are to be found amongst dissenters of all denominations.
The lutherans in Denmark, are much on a par with the ecclesiastics in
England; and the face of most Christian countries presents a dreadful
scene of ignorance, hypocrisy, and profligacy. Various baneful, and
pernicious errors appear to gain ground, in almost every part of
Christendom; the truths of the gospel, and even the gospel itself, are
attacked, and every method that the enemy can invent is employed to
undermine the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ.

All these things are loud calls to Christians, and especially to
ministers, to exert themselves to the utmost in their several spheres
of action, and to try to enlarge them as much as possible.




                              SECT. IV.


        _The Practicability of something being done, more than
          what is done, for the Conversion of the Heathen._


The impediments in the way of carrying the gospel among the heathen
must arise, I think, from one or other of the following things;
--either their distance from us, their barbarous and savage manner of
living, the danger of being killed by them, the difficulty of
procuring the necessaries of life, or the unintelligibleness of their
languages.

FIRST, as to their distance from us, whatever objections might have
been made on that account before the invention of the mariner's
compass, nothing can be alledged for it, with any colour of
plausibility in the present age.   Men can now sail with as much
certainty through the Great South Sea, as they can through the
Mediterranean, or any lesser Sea.   Yea, and providence seems in a
manner to invite us to the trial, as there are to our knowledge
trading companies, whose commerce lies in many of the places where,
these barbarians dwell. At one time or other ships are sent to visit
places of more recent discovery, and to explore parts the most
unknown; and every fresh account of their ignorance, or cruelty,
should call forth our pity, and excite us to concur with providence in
seeking their eternal good. Scripture likewise seems to point out this
method, _Surely the Isles shall wait for me; the ships of Tarshish
first, to bring my sons from far, their silver, and their gold with
them, unto the name of the Lord, thy God._ Isai. lx. 9. This seems to
imply that in the time of the glorious increase of the church, in the
latter days, (of which the whole chapter is undoubtedly a prophecy,)
commerce shall subserve the spread of the gospel. The ships of
Tarshish were trading vessels, which made voyages for traffic to
various parts; thus much therefore must be meant by it, that
_navigation_, especially that which is _commercial_, shall be one
great mean of carrying on the work of God;  and perhaps it may imply
that there shall be a very considerable appropriation of wealth to
that purpose.

SECONDLY, as to their uncivilized, and barbarous way of living, this
can be no objection to any, except those whose love of ease renders
them unwilling to expose themselves to inconveniencies for the good of
others.

It was no objection to the apostles and their successors, who went
among the barbarous _Germans_ and _Gauls_, and still more barbarous
_Britons_! They did not wait for the ancient inhabitants of these
countries, to be civilized, before they could be christianized, but
went simply with the doctrine of the cross; and TERTULLIAN could boast
that "those parts of Britain which were proof against the Roman
armies, were conquered by the gospel of Christ"--It was no objection
to an ELLIOT, or a BRAINERD, in later times. They went forth, and
encountered every difficulty of the kind, and found that a cordial
reception of the gospel produced those happy effects which the longest
intercourse with Europeans, without it could never accomplish. It _is_
no objection to commercial men. It only requires that we should have
as much love to the souls of our fellow-creatures, and fellow sinners,
as they have for the profits arising from a few otter-skins, and all
these difficulties would be easily surmounted.

After all, the uncivilized state of the heathen, instead of affording
an objection _against_ preaching the gospel to them, ought to furnish
an argument _for_ it. Can we as men, or as christians, hear that a
great part of our fellow creatures, whose souls are as immortal as
ours, and who are as capable as ourselves, of adorning the gospel, and
contributing by their preaching, writings, or practices to the glory
of our Redeemer's name, and the good of his church, are inveloped in
ignorance and barbarism? Can we hear that they are without the gospel,
without government, without laws, and without arts, and sciences; and
not exert ourselves to introduce amongst them the sentiments of men,
and of Christians? Would not the spread of the gospel be the most
effectual mean of their civilization? Would not that make them useful
members of society? We know that such effects did in a measure follow
the afore-mentioned efforts of _Elliot_, _Brainerd_, and others
amongst the American Indians; and if similar attempts were made in
other parts of the world, and succeeded with a divine blessing (which
we have every reason to think they would) might we not expect to see
able Divines, or read well-conducted treatises in defence of the
truth, even amongst those who at present seem to be scarcely human?

THIRDLY, _In respect to the danger of being killed by them_, it is
true that whoever does go must put his life in his hand, and not
consult with flesh and blood; but do not the goodness of the cause,
the duties incumbent on us as the creatures of God, and Christians,
and the perishing state of our fellow men, loudly call upon us to
venture all and use every warrantable exertion for their benefit? PAUL
and BARNABAS, who _hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ_, were not blamed as being rash, but commended for so doing,
while JOHN MARK who through timidity of mind deserted them in their
perilous undertaking, was branded with censure. After all, as has been
already observed, I greatly question whether most of the barbarities
practiced by the savages upon those who have visited them, have not
originated in some real or supposed affront, and were therefore, more
properly, acts of self-defence, than proofs of ferocious dispositions.
No wonder if the imprudence of sailors should prompt them to offend
the simple savage, and the offence be resented; but _Elliot_,
_Brainerd_, and the _Moravian missionaries_, have been very seldom
molested. Nay, in general the heathen have shewed a willingness to
hear the word; and have principally expressed their hatred of
Christianity on account of the vices of nominal Christians.

FOURTHLY, _As to the difficulty of procuring the necessaries of life_,
this would not be so great as may appear at first sight; for though we
could not procure European food, yet we might procure such as the
natives of those countries which we visit, subsist upon themselves.
And this would only be passing through what we have virtually engaged,
in by entering on the ministerial office. A Christian minister is a
person who in a peculiar sense is _not his own_; he is the _servant_
of God, and therefore ought to be wholly devoted to him. By entering
on that sacred office he solemnly undertakes to be always engaged, as
much as possible, in the Lord's work, and not to chuse his own
pleasure, or employment, or pursue the ministry as a something that is
to subserve his own ends, or interests, or as a kind of bye-work. He
engages to go where God pleases, and to do, or endure what he sees fit
to command, or call him to, in the exercise of his function. He
virtually bids farewell to friends, pleasures, and comforts, and
stands in readiness to endure the greatest sufferings in the work of
his Lord, and Master. It is inconsistent for ministers to please
themselves with thoughts of a numerous auditory, cordial friends, a
civilized country, legal protection, affluence, splendor, or even a
competency. The flights, and hatred of men, and even pretended
friends, gloomy prisons, and tortures, the society of barbarians of
uncouth speech, miserable accommodations in wretched wildernesses,
hunger, and thirst, nakedness, weariness, and painfulness, hard work,
and but little worldly encouragement, should rather be the objects of
their expectation. Thus the apostles acted, in the primitive times,
and endured hardness, as good soldiers of Jesus Christ; and though we
living in a civilized country where Christianity is protected by law,
are not called to suffer these things while we continue here, yet I
question whether all are justified in staying here, while so many are
perishing without means of grace in other lands. Sure I am that it is
entirely contrary to the spirit of the gospel, for its ministers to
enter upon it from interested motives, or with great worldly
expectations. On the contrary the commission is a sufficient call to
them to venture all, and, like the primitive Christians, go every
where preaching the gospel.

It might be necessary, however, for two, at least, to go together, and
in general I should think it best that they should be married men, and
to prevent their time from being employed in procuring necessaries,
two, or more, other persons, with their wives and families, might also
accompany them, who should be wholly employed in providing for them.
In most countries it would be necessary for them to cultivate a little
spot of ground just for their support, which would be a resource to
them, whenever their supplies failed. Not to mention the advantages
they would reap from each others company, it would take off the
enormous expence which has always attended undertakings of this kind,
the first expence being the whole; for though a large colony needs
support for a considerable time, yet so small a number would, upon
receiving the first crop, maintain themselves. They would have the
advantage of choosing their situation, their wants would be few; the
women, and even the children, would be necessary for domestic
purposes; and a few articles of stock, as a cow or two, and a bull,
and a few other cattle of both sexes, a very few utensils of
husbandry, and some corn to sow their land, would be sufficient. Those
who attend the missionaries should understand husbandry, fishing,
fowling, &c. and be provided with the necessary implements for these
purposes. Indeed a variety of methods may be thought of, and when once
the work is undertaken, many things will suggest themselves to us, of
which we at present can form no idea.

FIFTHLY, As to _learning their languages_, the same means would be
found necessary here as in trade between different nations. In some
cases interpreters might be obtained, who might be employed for a
time; and where these were not to be found, the missionaries must have
patience, and mingle with the people, till they have learned so much
of their language as to be able to communicate their ideas to them in
it. It is well known to require no very extraordinary talents to
learn, in the space of a year, or two at most, the language of any
people upon earth, so much of it at least, as to be able to convey any
sentiments we wish to their understandings.

The Missionaries must be men of great piety, prudence, courage, and
forbearance; of undoubted orthodoxy in their sentiments, and must
enter with all their hearts into the spirit of their mission; they
must be willing to leave all the comforts of life behind them, and to
encounter all the hardships of a torrid, or a frigid climate, an
uncomfortable manner of living, and every other inconvenience that can
attend this undertaking. Clothing, a few knives, powder and shot,
fishing-tackle, and the articles of husbandry above-mentioned, must be
provided for them; and when arrived at the place of their destination,
their first business must be to gain some acquaintance with the
language of the natives, (for which purpose two would be better than
one,) and by all lawful means to endeavour to cultivate a friendship
with them, and as soon as possible let them know the errand for which
they were sent. They must endeavour to convince them that it was their
good alone, which induced them to forsake their friends, and all the
comforts of their native country. They must be very careful not to
resent injuries which may be offered to them, nor to think highly of
themselves, so as to despise the poor heathens, and by those means lay
a foundation for their resentment, or rejection of the gospel. They
must take every opportunity of doing them good, and labouring, and
travelling, night and day, they must instruct, exhort, and rebuke,
with all long suffering, and anxious desire for them, and, above all,
must be instant in prayer for the effusion of the Holy Spirit upon the
people of their charge. Let but missionaries of the above description
engage in the work, and we shall see that it is not impracticable.

It might likewise be of importance, if God should bless their labours,
for them to encourage any appearances of gifts amongst the people of
their charge; if such should be raised up many advantages would be
derived from their knowledge of the language, and customs of their
countrymen; and their change of conduct would give great weight to
their ministrations.




                              SECT.  V.


       _An Enquiry into the Duty of Christians in general, and
     what Means ought to be used, in order to promote this Work._


If the prophecies concerning the increase of Christ's kingdom be true,
and if what has been advanced, concerning the commission given by him
to his disciples being obligatory on us, be just, it must be inferred
that all Christians ought heartily to concur with God in promoting his
glorious designs, for _he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit_.

One of the first, and most important of those duties which are
incumbent upon us, is _fervent and united prayer_. However the
influence of the Holy Spirit may be set at nought, and run down by
many, it will be found upon trial, that all means which we can use,
without it, will be ineffectual. If a temple is raised for God in the
heathen world, it will not be _by might, nor by power_, nor by the
authority of the magistrate, or the eloquence of the orator; _but by
my Spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts_. We must therefore be in real
earnest in supplicating his blessing upon our labours.

It is represented in the prophets, that when there shall be _a great
mourning in the land, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of
Megiddon, and every family shall mourn apart, and their wives apart_,
it shall all follow upon _a spirit of grace, and supplication_. And
when these things shall take place, it is promised that _there shall
be a fountain opened for the house of David, and for the inhabitants
of Jerusalem, for sin, and for uncleanness_,--and that _the idols
shall be destroyed_, and _the false prophets ashamed_ of their
profession. Zech. xii 10. 14.--xiii. 1. 6. This prophesy seems to
teach that when there shall be an universal conjunction in fervent
prayer, and all shall esteem Zion's welfare as their own, then copious
influences of the Spirit shall be shed upon the churches, which like a
purifying _fountain_ shall cleanse the servants of the Lord. Nor shall
this cleansing influence stop here; all old idolatrous prejudices
shall be rooted out, and truth prevail so gloriously that false
teachers shall be so ashamed as rather to wish to be classed with
obscure herdsmen, or the meanest peasants, than bear the ignominy
attendant on their detection.

The most glorious works of grace that have ever took place, have been
in answer to prayer; and it is in this way, we have the greatest
reason to suppose, that the glorious out-pouring of the Spirit, which
we expect at last, will be bestowed.

With respect to our own immediate connections, we have within these
few years been favoured with some tokens for good, granted in answer
to prayer, which should encourage us to persist, and increase in that
important duty.  I trust our _monthly prayer-meetings_ for the success
of the gospel have not been in vain.  It is true a want of importunity
too generally attends our prayers; yet unimportunate, and feeble as
they have been, it is to be believed that God has heard, and in a
measure answered them.  The churches that have engaged in the practice
have in general since that time been evidently on the increase; some
controversies which have long perplexed and divided the church, are
more clearly stated than ever; there are calls to preach the gospel in
many places where it has not been usually published; yea, a glorious
door is opened, and is likely to be opened wider and wider, by the
spread of civil and religious liberty, accompanied also by a
diminution of the spirit of popery; a noble effort has been made to
abolish the inhuman Slave-Trade, and though at present it has not been
so successful as might be wished, yet it is to be hoped it will be
persevered in, till it is accomplished.  In the mean time it is a
satisfaction to consider that the late defeat of the abolition of the
Slave-Trade has proved the occasion of a praise worthy effort to
introduce a free settlement, at _Sierra Leona_, on the coast of
Africa; an effort which, if succeeded with a divine blessing, not only
promises to open a way for honourable commerce with that extensive
country, and for the civilization of its inhabitants, but may prove
the happy mean of introducing amongst them the gospel of our Lord
Jesus Christ.

These are events that ought not to be over-looked; they are not to be
reckoned small things; and yet perhaps they _are_ small compared with
what might have been expected, if all had cordially entered into the
spirit of the proposal, so as to have made the cause of Christ their
own, or in other words to have been so solicitous about it, as if
their own advantage depended upon its success. If an holy solicitude
had prevailed in all the assemblies of Christians in behalf of their
Redeemer's kingdom, we might probably have seen before now, not only
an _open door_ for the gospel, but _many running to and fro, and
knowledge increased_; or a diligent use of those means which
providence has put in our power, accompanied with a greater blessing
than ordinary from heaven.

Many can do nothing but pray, and prayer is perhaps the only thing in
which Christians of all denominations can cordially, and unreservedly
unite; but in this we may all be one, and in this the strictest
unanimity ought to prevail. Were the whole body thus animated by one
soul, with what pleasure would Christians attend on all the duties of
religion, and with what delight would their ministers attend on all
the business of their calling.

We must not be contented however with praying, without _exerting
ourselves in the use of means_ for the obtaining of those things we
pray for. Were _the children of light_, but _as wise in their
generation as the children of this world_, they would stretch every
nerve to gain so glorious a prize, nor ever imagine that it was to be
obtained in any other way.

When a trading company have obtained their charter they usually go to
its utmost limits; and their stocks, their ships, their officers, and
men are so chosen, and regulated, as to be likely to answer their
purpose; but they do not stop here, for encouraged by the prospect of
success, they use every effort, cast their bread upon the waters,
cultivate friendship with every one from whose information they expect
the least advantage. They cross the widest and most tempestuous seas,
and encounter the most unfavourable climates; they introduce
themselves into the most barbarous nations, and sometimes undergo the
most affecting hardships; their minds continue in a state of anxiety,
and suspence, and a longer delay than usual in the arrival of their
vessels agitates them with a thousand changeful thoughts, and
foreboding apprehensions, which continue till the rich returns are
safe arrived in port. But why these fears? Whence all these
disquietudes, and this labour? Is it not because their souls enter
into the spirit of the project, and their happiness in a manner
depends on its success?--Christians are a body whose truest interest
lies in the exaltation of the Messiah's kingdom. Their charter is very
extensive, their encouragements exceeding great, and the returns
promised infinitely superior to all the gains of the most lucrative
fellowship. Let then every one in his station consider himself as
bound to act with all his might, and in every possible way for God.

Suppose a company of serious Christians, ministers and private
persons, were to form themselves into a society, and make a number of
rules respecting the regulation of the plan, and the persons who are
to be employed as missionaries, the means of defraying the expence,
&c. &c. This society must consist of persons whose hearts are in the
work,  men of serious religion, and possessing a spirit of
perseverance; there must be a determination not to admit any person
who is not of this description, or to retain him longer than he
answers to it.

From such a society a _committee_ might be appointed, whose business
it should be to procure all the information they could upon the
subject, to receive contributions, to enquire into the characters,
tempers, abilities and religious views of the missionaries, and also
to provide them with necessaries for their undertakings.

They must also pay a great attention to the views of those who
undertake this work; for want of this the missions to the Spice
Islands, sent by the Dutch East-India Company, were soon corrupted,
many going more for the sake of settling in a place where temporal
gain invited them, than of preaching to the poor Indians. This soon
introduced a number of indolent, or profligate persons, whose lives
were a scandal to the doctrines which they preached: and by means of
whom the gospel was ejected from Ternate, in 1694, and Christianity
fell into great disrepute in other places.

If there is any reason for me to hope that I shall have any influence
upon any of my brethren, and fellow Christians, probably it may be
more especially amongst them of my own denomination. I would therefore
propose that such a society and committee should be formed amongst the
_particular baptist denomination_.

I do not mean by this, in any wife to confine it to one denomination
of Christians. I wish with all my heart, that every one who loves our
Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, would in some way or other engage in
it. But in the present divided state of Christendom, it would be more
likely for good to be done by each denomination engaging separately in
the work, than if they were to embark in it conjointly. There is room
enough for us all, without interfering with each other; and if no
unfriendly interference took place, each denomination would bear good
will to the other, and wish, and pray for its success, considering it
as upon the whole friendly to the great cause of true religion; but if
all were intermingled, it is likely their private discords might throw
a damp upon their spirits, and much retard their public usefulness.

In respect to _contributions_ for defraying the expences, money will
doubtless be wanting; and suppose the rich were to embark a portion of
that wealth over which God has made them stewards, in this important
undertaking, perhaps there are few ways that would turn to a better
account at last. Nor ought it to be confined to the _rich_; if persons
in more moderate circumstances were to devote a portion, suppose a
_tenth_, of their annual increase to the Lord, it would not only
correspond with the practice of the Israelites, who lived under the
Mosaic Oeconomy, but of the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
before that dispensation commenced. Many of our most eminent
fore-fathers amongst the _Puritans_, followed that practice; and if
that were but attended to now, there would not only be enough to
support the ministry of the gospel at home, and to encourage _village
preaching_ in our respective neighbourhoods, but to defray the
expences of carrying the gospel into the heathen world.

If congregations were to open subscriptions of _one penny_, or more
per week, according to their circumstances, and deposit it as a fund
for the propogation of the gospel, much might be raised in this way.
By such simple means they might soon have it in their power to
introduce the preaching of the gospel into most of the villages in
England; where, though men are placed whose business it should be to
give light to those who sit in darkness, it is well known that they
have it not. Where there was no person to open his house for the
reception of the gospel, some other building might be procured for a
small sum, and even then something considerable might be spared for
the baptist, or other committees, for propogating the gospel amongst
the heathen.

Many persons have of late left off the use of _West-India sugar_ on
account of the iniquitous manner in which it is obtained. Those
families who have done so, and have not substituted any thing else in
its place, have not only cleansed their hands of blood, but have made
a saving to their families, some of six pence, and some of a shilling
a week. If this, or a part of this were appropriated to the uses
before-mentioned, it would abundantly suffice. We have only to keep
the end in view, and have our hearts thoroughly engaged in the pursuit
of it, and means will not be very difficult.

We are exhorted _to lay up treasure in heaven, where neither moth nor
rust doth corrupt, nor thieves break through and steal._ It is also
declared that _whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap._
These Scriptures teach us that the enjoyments of the life to come,
bear a near relation to that which now is; a relation similar to that
of the harvest, and the seed. It is true all the reward is of mere
grace, but it is nevertheless encouraging; what a _treasure_, what an
_harvest_ must await such characters as PAUL, and ELLIOT, and
BRAINERD, and others, who have given themselves wholly to the work of
the Lord. What a heaven will it be to see the many myriads of poor
heathens, of Britons amongst the rest, who by their labours have been
brought to the knowledge of God. Surely a _crown of rejoicing_ like
this is worth aspiring to. Surely it is worth while to lay ourselves
out with all our might, in promoting the cause, and kingdom of Christ.

Riders to the Sea

A PLAY IN ONE ACT

by J. M. Synge

Contents

 INTRODUCTION
 RIDERS TO THE SEA




INTRODUCTION


It must have been on Syngeâs second visit to the Aran Islands that he
had the experience out of which was wrought what many believe to be his
greatest play. The scene of âRiders to the Seaâ is laid in a cottage on
Inishmaan, the middle and most interesting island of the Aran group.
While Synge was on Inishmaan, the story came to him of a man whose body
had been washed up on the far away coast of Donegal, and who, by reason
of certain peculiarities of dress, was suspected to be from the island.
In due course, he was recognised as a native of Inishmaan, in exactly
the manner described in the play, and perhaps one of the most
poignantly vivid passages in Syngeâs book on âThe Aran Islandsâ relates
the incident of his burial.

The other element in the story which Synge introduces into the play is
equally true. Many tales of âsecond sightâ are to be heard among Celtic
races. In fact, they are so common as to arouse little or no wonder in
the minds of the people. It is just such a tale, which there seems no
valid reason for doubting, that Synge heard, and that gave the title,
âRiders to the Seaâ, to his play.

It is the dramatistâs high distinction that he has simply taken the
materials which lay ready to his hand, and by the power of sympathy
woven them, with little modification, into a tragedy which, for
dramatic irony and noble pity, has no equal among its contemporaries.
Great tragedy, it is frequently claimed with some show of justice, has
perforce departed with the advance of modern life and its complicated
tangle of interests and creature comforts. A highly developed
civilisation, with its attendant specialisation of culture, tends ever
to lose sight of those elemental forces, those primal emotions, naked
to wind and sky, which are the stuff from which great drama is wrought
by the artist, but which, as it would seem, are rapidly departing from
us. It is only in the far places, where solitary communion may be had
with the elements, that this dynamic life is still to be found
continuously, and it is accordingly thither that the dramatist, who
would deal with spiritual life disengaged from the environment of an
intellectual maze, must go for that experience which will beget in him
inspiration for his art. The Aran Islands from which Synge gained his
inspiration are rapidly losing that sense of isolation and
self-dependence, which has hitherto been their rare distinction, and
which furnished the motivation for Syngeâs masterpiece. Whether or not
Synge finds a successor, it is none the less true that in English
dramatic literature âRiders to the Seaâ has an historic value which it
would be difficult to over-estimate in its accomplishment and its
possibilities. A writer in The Manchester Guardian shortly after
Syngeâs death phrased it rightly when he wrote that it is âthe tragic
masterpiece of our language in our time; wherever it has been played in
Europe from Galway to Prague, it has made the word tragedy mean
something more profoundly stirring and cleansing to the spirit than it
did.â

The secret of the playâs power is its capacity for standing afar off,
and mingling, if we may say so, sympathy with relentlessness. There is
a wonderful beauty of speech in the words of every character, wherein
the latent power of suggestion is almost unlimited. âIn the big world
the old people do be leaving things after them for their sons and
children, but in this place it is the young men do be leaving things
behind for them that do be old.â In the quavering rhythm of these
words, there is poignantly present that quality of strangeness and
remoteness in beauty which, as we are coming to realise, is the
touchstone of Celtic literary art. However, the very asceticism of the
play has begotten a corresponding power which lifts Syngeâs work far
out of the current of the Irish literary revival, and sets it high in a
timeless atmosphere of universal action.

Its characters live and die. It is their virtue in life to be lonely,
and none but the lonely man in tragedy may be great. He dies, and then
it is the virtue in life of the women mothers and wives and sisters to
be great in their loneliness, great as Maurya, the stricken mother, is
great in her final word.

âMichael has a clean burial in the far north, by the grace of the
Almighty God. Bartley will have a fine coffin out of the white boards,
and a deep grave surely. What more can we want than that? No man at all
can be living for ever, and we must be satisfied.â The pity and the
terror of it all have brought a great peace, the peace that passeth
understanding, and it is because the play holds this timeless peace
after the storm which has bowed down every character, that âRiders to
the Seaâ may rightly take its place as the greatest modern tragedy in
the English tongue.

RIDERS TO THE SEA

 A PLAY IN ONE ACT


First performed at the Molesworth Hall, Dublin, February 25th, 1904.

PERSONS

MAURYA (_an old woman_)......  Honor Lavelle BARTLEY (_her
son_)..........  W. G. Fay CATHLEEN (_her daughter_)....  Sarah Allgood
NORA (_a younger daughter_)..  Emma Vernon MEN AND WOMEN

SCENE.

An Island off the West of Ireland.
    (Cottage kitchen, with nets, oil-skins, spinning wheel, some new
    boards standing by the wall, etc. Cathleen, a girl of about twenty,
    finishes kneading cake, and puts it down in the pot-oven by the
    fire; then wipes her hands, and begins to spin at the wheel. Nora,
    a young girl, puts her head in at the door.)


NORA.
_In a low voice._âWhere is she?

CATHLEEN.
Sheâs lying down, God help her, and may be sleeping, if sheâs able.

[_Nora comes in softly, and takes a bundle from under her shawl._]

CATHLEEN.
_Spinning the wheel rapidly._âWhat is it you have?

NORA.
The young priest is after bringing them. Itâs a shirt and a plain
stocking were got off a drowned man in Donegal.

[_Cathleen stops her wheel with a sudden movement, and leans out to
listen._]

NORA.
Weâre to find out if itâs Michaelâs they are, some time herself will be
down looking by the sea.

CATHLEEN.
How would they be Michaelâs, Nora. How would he go the length of that
way to the far north?

NORA.
The young priest says heâs known the like of it. âIf itâs Michaelâs
they are,â says he, âyou can tell herself heâs got a clean burial by
the grace of God, and if theyâre not his, let no one say a word about
them, for sheâll be getting her death,â says he, âwith crying and
lamenting.â

[_The door which Nora half closed is blown open by a gust of wind._]

CATHLEEN.
_Looking out anxiously._âDid you ask him would he stop Bartley going
this day with the horses to the Galway fair?

NORA.
âI wonât stop him,â says he, âbut let you not be afraid. Herself does
be saying prayers half through the night, and the Almighty God wonât
leave her destitute,â says he, âwith no son living.â

CATHLEEN.
Is the sea bad by the white rocks, Nora?

NORA.
Middling bad, God help us. Thereâs a great roaring in the west, and
itâs worse itâll be getting when the tideâs turned to the wind.

[_She goes over to the table with the bundle._]

Shall I open it now?

CATHLEEN.
Maybe sheâd wake up on us, and come in before weâd done.

[_Coming to the table._]

Itâs a long time weâll be, and the two of us crying.

NORA.
_Goes to the inner door and listens._âSheâs moving about on the bed.
Sheâll be coming in a minute.

CATHLEEN.
Give me the ladder, and Iâll put them up in the turf-loft, the way she
wonât know of them at all, and maybe when the tide turns sheâll be
going down to see would he be floating from the east.

[_They put the ladder against the gable of the chimney; Cathleen goes
up a few steps and hides the bundle in the turf-loft. Maurya comes from
the inner room._]

MAURYA.
_Looking up at Cathleen and speaking querulously._âIsnât it turf enough
you have for this day and evening?

CATHLEEN.
Thereâs a cake baking at the fire for a short space. [_Throwing down
the turf_] and Bartley will want it when the tide turns if he goes to
Connemara.

[_Nora picks up the turf and puts it round the pot-oven._]

MAURYA.
_Sitting down on a stool at the fire._âHe wonât go this day with the
wind rising from the south and west. He wonât go this day, for the
young priest will stop him surely.

NORA.
Heâll not stop him, mother, and I heard Eamon Simon and Stephen Pheety
and Colum Shawn saying he would go.

MAURYA.
Where is he itself?

NORA.
He went down to see would there be another boat sailing in the week,
and Iâm thinking it wonât be long till heâs here now, for the tideâs
turning at the green head, and the hookerâ tacking from the east.

CATHLEEN.
I hear some one passing the big stones.

NORA.
_Looking out._âHeâs coming now, and heâs in a hurry.

BARTLEY.
_Comes in and looks round the room. Speaking sadly and quietly._âWhere
is the bit of new rope, Cathleen, was bought in Connemara?

CATHLEEN.
_Coming down._âGive it to him, Nora; itâs on a nail by the white
boards. I hung it up this morning, for the pig with the black feet was
eating it.

NORA.
_Giving him a rope._âIs that it, Bartley?

MAURYA.
Youâd do right to leave that rope, Bartley, hanging by the boards
[_Bartley takes the rope_]. It will be wanting in this place, Iâm
telling you, if Michael is washed up to-morrow morning, or the next
morning, or any morning in the week, for itâs a deep grave weâll make
him by the grace of God.

BARTLEY.
_Beginning to work with the rope._âIâve no halter the way I can ride
down on the mare, and I must go now quickly. This is the one boat going
for two weeks or beyond it, and the fair will be a good fair for horses
I heard them saying below.

MAURYA.
Itâs a hard thing theyâll be saying below if the body is washed up and
thereâs no man in it to make the coffin, and I after giving a big price
for the finest white boards youâd find in Connemara.

[_She looks round at the boards._]

BARTLEY.
How would it be washed up, and we after looking each day for nine days,
and a strong wind blowing a while back from the west and south?

MAURYA.
If it wasnât found itself, that wind is raising the sea, and there was
a star up against the moon, and it rising in the night. If it was a
hundred horses, or a thousand horses you had itself, what is the price
of a thousand horses against a son where there is one son only?

BARTLEY.
_Working at the halter, to Cathleen._âLet you go down each day, and see
the sheep arenât jumping in on the rye, and if the jobber comes you can
sell the pig with the black feet if there is a good price going.

MAURYA.
How would the like of her get a good price for a pig?

BARTLEY.
_To Cathleen._âIf the west wind holds with the last bit of the moon let
you and Nora get up weed enough for another cock for the kelp. Itâs
hard set weâll be from this day with no one in it but one man to work.

MAURYA.
Itâs hard set weâll be surely the day youâre drowndâd with the rest.
What way will I live and the girls with me, and I an old woman looking
for the grave?

[_Bartley lays down the halter, takes off his old coat, and puts on a
newer one of the same flannel._]

BARTLEY.
_To Nora._âIs she coming to the pier?

NORA.
_Looking out._âSheâs passing the green head and letting fall her sails.

BARTLEY.
_Getting his purse and tobacco._âIâll have half an hour to go down, and
youâll see me coming again in two days, or in three days, or maybe in
four days if the wind is bad.

MAURYA.
_Turning round to the fire, and putting her shawl over her head._âIsnât
it a hard and cruel man wonât hear a word from an old woman, and she
holding him from the sea?

CATHLEEN.
Itâs the life of a young man to be going on the sea, and who would
listen to an old woman with one thing and she saying it over?

BARTLEY.
_Taking the halter._âI must go now quickly. Iâll ride down on the red
mare, and the gray ponyâll run behind me. . . The blessing of God on
you.

[_He goes out._]

MAURYA.
_Crying out as he is in the door._âHeâs gone now, God spare us, and
weâll not see him again. Heâs gone now, and when the black night is
falling Iâll have no son left me in the world.

CATHLEEN.
Why wouldnât you give him your blessing and he looking round in the
door? Isnât it sorrow enough is on every one in this house without your
sending him out with an unlucky word behind him, and a hard word in his
ear?

[_Maurya takes up the tongs and begins raking the fire aimlessly
without looking round._]

NORA.
_Turning towards her._âYouâre taking away the turf from the cake.

CATHLEEN.
_Crying out._âThe Son of God forgive us, Nora, weâre after forgetting
his bit of bread.

[_She comes over to the fire._]

NORA.
And itâs destroyed heâll be going till dark night, and he after eating
nothing since the sun went up.

CATHLEEN.
_Turning the cake out of the oven._âItâs destroyed heâll be, surely.
Thereâs no sense left on any person in a house where an old woman will
be talking for ever.

[_Maurya sways herself on her stool._]

CATHLEEN.
_Cutting off some of the bread and rolling it in a cloth; to
Maurya._âLet you go down now to the spring well and give him this and
he passing. Youâll see him then and the dark word will be broken, and
you can say âGod speed you,â the way heâll be easy in his mind.

MAURYA.
_Taking the bread._âWill I be in it as soon as himself?

CATHLEEN.
If you go now quickly.

MAURYA.
_Standing up unsteadily._âItâs hard set I am to walk.

CATHLEEN.
_Looking at her anxiously._âGive her the stick, Nora, or maybe sheâll
slip on the big stones.

NORA.
What stick?

CATHLEEN.
The stick Michael brought from Connemara.

MAURYA.
_Taking a stick Nora gives her._âIn the big world the old people do be
leaving things after them for their sons and children, but in this
place it is the young men do be leaving things behind for them that do
be old.

[_She goes out slowly. Nora goes over to the ladder._]

CATHLEEN.
Wait, Nora, maybe sheâd turn back quickly. Sheâs that sorry, God help
her, you wouldnât know the thing sheâd do.

NORA.
Is she gone round by the bush?

CATHLEEN.
_Looking out._âSheâs gone now. Throw it down quickly, for the Lord
knows when sheâll be out of it again.

NORA.
_Getting the bundle from the loft._âThe young priest said heâd be
passing to-morrow, and we might go down and speak to him below if itâs
Michaelâs they are surely.

CATHLEEN.
_Taking the bundle._âDid he say what way they were found?

NORA.
_Coming down._ââThere were two men,â says he, âand they rowing round
with poteen before the cocks crowed, and the oar of one of them caught
the body, and they passing the black cliffs of the north.â

CATHLEEN.
_Trying to open the bundle._âGive me a knife, Nora, the stringâs
perished with the salt water, and thereâs a black knot on it you
wouldnât loosen in a week.

NORA.
_Giving her a knife._âIâve heard tell it was a long way to Donegal.

CATHLEEN.
_Cutting the string._âIt is surely. There was a man in here a while
agoâthe man sold us that knifeâand he said if you set off walking from
the rocks beyond, it would be seven days youâd be in Donegal.

NORA.
And what time would a man take, and he floating?

[_Cathleen opens the bundle and takes out a bit of a stocking. They
look at them eagerly._]

CATHLEEN.
_In a low voice._âThe Lord spare us, Nora! isnât it a queer hard thing
to say if itâs his they are surely?

NORA.
Iâll get his shirt off the hook the way we can put the one flannel on
the other [_she looks through some clothes hanging in the corner._]
Itâs not with them, Cathleen, and where will it be?

CATHLEEN.
Iâm thinking Bartley put it on him in the morning, for his own shirt
was heavy with the salt in it [_pointing to the corner_]. Thereâs a bit
of a sleeve was of the same stuff. Give me that and it will do.

[_Nora brings it to her and they compare the flannel._]

CATHLEEN.
Itâs the same stuff, Nora; but if it is itself arenât there great rolls
of it in the shops of Galway, and isnât it many another man may have a
shirt of it as well as Michael himself?

NORA.
_Who has taken up the stocking and counted the stitches, crying
out._âItâs Michael, Cathleen, itâs Michael; God spare his soul, and
what will herself say when she hears this story, and Bartley on the
sea?

CATHLEEN.
_Taking the stocking._âItâs a plain stocking.

NORA.
Itâs the second one of the third pair I knitted, and I put up three
score stitches, and I dropped four of them.

CATHLEEN.
_Counts the stitches._âItâs that number is in it [_crying out._] Ah,
Nora, isnât it a bitter thing to think of him floating that way to the
far north, and no one to keen him but the black hags that do be flying
on the sea?

NORA.
_Swinging herself round, and throwing out her arms on the clothes._âAnd
isnât it a pitiful thing when there is nothing left of a man who was a
great rower and fisher, but a bit of an old shirt and a plain stocking?

CATHLEEN.
_After an instant._âTell me is herself coming, Nora? I hear a little
sound on the path.

NORA.
_Looking out._âShe is, Cathleen. Sheâs coming up to the door.

CATHLEEN.
Put these things away before sheâll come in. Maybe itâs easier sheâll
be after giving her blessing to Bartley, and we wonât let on weâve
heard anything the time heâs on the sea.

NORA.
_Helping Cathleen to close the bundle._âWeâll put them here in the
corner.

[_They put them into a hole in the chimney corner. Cathleen goes back
to the spinning-wheel._]

NORA.
Will she see it was crying I was?

CATHLEEN.
Keep your back to the door the way the lightâll not be on you.

[_Nora sits down at the chimney corner, with her back to the door.
Maurya comes in very slowly, without looking at the girls, and goes
over to her stool at the other side of the fire. The cloth with the
bread is still in her hand. The girls look at each other, and Nora
points to the bundle of bread._]

CATHLEEN.
_After spinning for a moment._âYou didnât give him his bit of bread?

[_Maurya begins to keen softly, without turning round._]

CATHLEEN.
Did you see him riding down?

[_Maurya goes on keening._]

CATHLEEN.
_A little impatiently._âGod forgive you; isnât it a better thing to
raise your voice and tell what you seen, than to be making lamentation
for a thing thatâs done? Did you see Bartley, Iâm saying to you?

MAURYA.
_With a weak voice._âMy heartâs broken from this day.

CATHLEEN.
_As before._âDid you see Bartley?

MAURYA.
I seen the fearfulest thing.

CATHLEEN.
_Leaves her wheel and looks out._âGod forgive you; heâs riding the mare
now over the green head, and the gray pony behind him.

MAURYA.
_Starts, so that her shawl falls back from her head and shows her white
tossed hair. With a frightened voice._âThe gray pony behind him.

CATHLEEN.
_Coming to the fire._âWhat is it ails you, at all?

MAURYA.
_Speaking very slowly._âIâve seen the fearfulest thing any person has
seen, since the day Bride Dara seen the dead man with the child in his
arms.

CATHLEEN AND NORA.
Uah.

[_They crouch down in front of the old woman at the fire._]

NORA.
Tell us what it is you seen.

MAURYA.
I went down to the spring well, and I stood there saying a prayer to
myself. Then Bartley came along, and he riding on the red mare with the
gray pony behind him [_she puts up her hands, as if to hide something
from her eyes._] The Son of God spare us, Nora!

CATHLEEN.
What is it you seen.

MAURYA.
I seen Michael himself.

CATHLEEN.
_Speaking softly._âYou did not, mother; it wasnât Michael you seen, for
his body is after being found in the far north, and heâs got a clean
burial by the grace of God.

MAURYA.
_A little defiantly._âIâm after seeing him this day, and he riding and
galloping. Bartley came first on the red mare; and I tried to say âGod
speed you,â but something choked the words in my throat. He went by
quickly; and âthe blessing of God on you,â says he, and I could say
nothing. I looked up then, and I crying, at the gray pony, and there
was Michael upon itâwith fine clothes on him, and new shoes on his
feet.

CATHLEEN.
_Begins to keen._âItâs destroyed we are from this day. Itâs destroyed,
surely.

NORA.
Didnât the young priest say the Almighty God wouldnât leave her
destitute with no son living?

MAURYA.
_In a low voice, but clearly._âItâs little the like of him knows of the
sea. . . . Bartley will be lost now, and let you call in Eamon and make
me a good coffin out of the white boards, for I wonât live after them.
Iâve had a husband, and a husbandâs father, and six sons in this
houseâsix fine men, though it was a hard birth I had with every one of
them and they coming to the worldâand some of them were found and some
of them were not found, but theyâre gone now the lot of them. . . There
were Stephen, and Shawn, were lost in the great wind, and found after
in the Bay of Gregory of the Golden Mouth, and carried up the two of
them on the one plank, and in by that door.

[_She pauses for a moment, the girls start as if they heard something
through the door that is half open behind them._]

NORA.
_In a whisper._âDid you hear that, Cathleen? Did you hear a noise in
the north-east?

CATHLEEN.
_In a whisper._âThereâs some one after crying out by the seashore.

MAURYA.
_Continues without hearing anything._âThere was Sheamus and his father,
and his own father again, were lost in a dark night, and not a stick or
sign was seen of them when the sun went up. There was Patch after was
drowned out of a curagh that turned over. I was sitting here with
Bartley, and he a baby, lying on my two knees, and I seen two women,
and three women, and four women coming in, and they crossing
themselves, and not saying a word. I looked out then, and there were
men coming after them, and they holding a thing in the half of a red
sail, and water dripping out of itâit was a dry day, Noraâand leaving a
track to the door.

[_She pauses again with her hand stretched out towards the door. It
opens softly and old women begin to come in, crossing themselves on the
threshold, and kneeling down in front of the stage with red petticoats
over their heads._]

MAURYA.
_Half in a dream, to Cathleen._âIs it Patch, or Michael, or what is it
at all?

CATHLEEN.
Michael is after being found in the far north, and when he is found
there how could he be here in this place?

MAURYA.
There does be a power of young men floating round in the sea, and what
way would they know if it was Michael they had, or another man like
him, for when a man is nine days in the sea, and the wind blowing, itâs
hard set his own mother would be to say what man was it.

CATHLEEN.
Itâs Michael, God spare him, for theyâre after sending us a bit of his
clothes from the far north.

[_She reaches out and hands Maurya the clothes that belonged to
Michael. Maurya stands up slowly, and takes them into her hands. Nora
looks out._]

NORA.
Theyâre carrying a thing among them and thereâs water dripping out of
it and leaving a track by the big stones.

CATHLEEN.
_In a whisper to the women who have come in._âIs it Bartley it is?

ONE OF THE WOMEN.
It is surely, God rest his soul.

[_Two younger women come in and pull out the table. Then men carry in
the body of Bartley, laid on a plank, with a bit of a sail over it, and
lay it on the table._]

CATHLEEN.
_To the women, as they are doing so._âWhat way was he drowned?

ONE OF THE WOMEN.
The gray pony knocked him into the sea, and he was washed out where
there is a great surf on the white rocks.

[_Maurya has gone over and knelt down at the head of the table. The
women are keening softly and swaying themselves with a slow movement.
Cathleen and Nora kneel at the other end of the table. The men kneel
near the door._]

MAURYA.
_Raising her head and speaking as if she did not see the people around
her._âTheyâre all gone now, and there isnât anything more the sea can
do to me.... Iâll have no call now to be up crying and praying when the
wind breaks from the south, and you can hear the surf is in the east,
and the surf is in the west, making a great stir with the two noises,
and they hitting one on the other. Iâll have no call now to be going
down and getting Holy Water in the dark nights after Samhain, and I
wonât care what way the sea is when the other women will be keening.
[_To Nora_]. Give me the Holy Water, Nora, thereâs a small sup still on
the dresser.

[_Nora gives it to her._]

MAURYA.
_Drops Michaelâs clothes across Bartleyâs feet, and sprinkles the Holy
Water over him._âIt isnât that I havenât prayed for you, Bartley, to
the Almighty God. It isnât that I havenât said prayers in the dark
night till you wouldnât know what Iâld be saying; but itâs a great rest
Iâll have now, and itâs time surely. Itâs a great rest Iâll have now,
and great sleeping in the long nights after Samhain, if itâs only a bit
of wet flour we do have to eat, and maybe a fish that would be
stinking.

[_She kneels down again, crossing herself, and saying prayers under her
breath._]

CATHLEEN.
_To an old man._âMaybe yourself and Eamon would make a coffin when the
sun rises. We have fine white boards herself bought, God help her,
thinking Michael would be found, and I have a new cake you can eat
while youâll be working.

THE OLD MAN.
_Looking at the boards._âAre there nails with them?

CATHLEEN.
There are not, Colum; we didnât think of the nails.

ANOTHER MAN.
Itâs a great wonder she wouldnât think of the nails, and all the
coffins sheâs seen made already.

CATHLEEN.
Itâs getting old she is, and broken.

[_Maurya stands up again very slowly and spreads out the pieces of
Michaelâs clothes beside the body, sprinkling them with the last of the
Holy Water_.]

NORA.
_In a whisper to Cathleen._âSheâs quiet now and easy; but the day
Michael was drowned you could hear her crying out from this to the
spring well. Itâs fonder she was of Michael, and would any one have
thought that?

CATHLEEN.
_Slowly and clearly._âAn old woman will be soon tired with anything she
will do, and isnât it nine days herself is after crying and keening,
and making great sorrow in the house?

MAURYA.
_Puts the empty cup mouth downwards on the table, and lays her hands
together on Bartleyâs feet._âTheyâre all together this time, and the
end is come. May the Almighty God have mercy on Bartleyâs soul, and on
Michaelâs soul, and on the souls of Sheamus and Patch, and Stephen and
Shawn [_bending her head_]; and may He have mercy on my soul, Nora, and
on the soul of every one is left living in the world.

[_She pauses, and the keen rises a little more loudly from the women,
then sinks away._]

MAURYA.
_Continuing._âMichael has a clean burial in the far north, by the grace
of the Almighty God. Bartley will have a fine coffin out of the white
boards, and a deep grave surely. What more can we want than that? No
man at all can be living for ever, and we must be satisfied.

[_She kneels down again and the curtain falls slowly._]

THE LOG OF A NONCOMBATANT

Staff Correspondent of the New York Evening Post
Special Correspondent of the Boston Journal

Preface

In the following pages the ego is thickly spread.  Their publication is
the result of persuasion from many sources that, before returning to
the war zone, I should put into connected form my personal
experiences as correspondent during the first year of the War of
Nations.  A few of these adventures were mentioned in news letters
from the Continent, where I limited myself so far as possible to
descriptions of armies at war and peoples in time of stress; but the
greater part of them were merely jotted down from time to time for my
own benefit in "The Log of a Noncombatant."

Chapter I

From Broadway To Ghent



When the war broke out in August, 1914, I was at work in the City
Room of the "New York Evening Post." One morning, during the first
week of activities, the copy boy handed me a telegram which was
signed "Luther, Boston," and contained the rather cryptic message:
--"How about this fight?"

It was some moments before I could recall the time, more than two
years before, when I had last seen the writer, Willard B.  Luther,
Boston lawyer, devotee of some, and critic of many kinds of sport.

We had been sitting on that previous occasion--a crowd of college
fellows, including Luther and myself--in a certain room in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, not far from the University in that
neighborhood where Luther had attended the Law School and the
rest of us, on our respective graduation days, had received valuable
pieces of parchment with the presidential signature attached.  The
conversation had already run through the question of Votes for
Women, progressive politics, and prize-fights, and before the card
game began it had settled on the last-named, chiefly because of my
own vainglorious description of adventures at Reno, Nevada, at the
time of the Jeffries-Johnson battle for the heavyweight championship
of the world.  I remember telling with some gusto of my first
newspaper interview--one with "Bob" Fitzsimmons, then the Old
Man of the ring, and "Gentleman" Jim Corbett, who was Jeffries'
trainer at Reno.

"I had always wanted to see that performance," said Luther, "and
would have gone in a flash if I could have got any one to make the
trip with me.  But remember this fact: whenever the next big fight is
held I'm going with you." Later in the evening we shook hands on the
proposition.

At the time that Luther's telegram came I was planning to start for the
Continent as Staff Correspondent of the "New York Evening Post"
and Special Correspondent of the "Boston Journal." Remembering
that Cambridge agreement I immediately wired:--

"Yes.  This fight will do."

So that is how it came to pass that Luther and myself boarded the
Campania together, landed in Liverpool, cast about for ways and
means of getting into the scrimmage, and for the first month and a
half of my four months of wandering on the Continent were brother
conspirators, until the duties of partnership called my friend home and
left me without a companion in adventure.

In London we absorbed to some extent a heavy British fog and to a
greater extent British public opinion.  We marveled at the exterior calm
of a nation plunged in the greatest of wars, yet fighting, so it seemed
at the time, with its top hat on and its smile still undisturbed.  Across
the English Channel three days later the Dutch steam packet
Princess Juliana carried us safely through mine fields and between
lanes of British torpedo boats and torpedo boat destroyers.  We
landed on the Continent at Flushing.  Thence we headed for The
Hague, Holland, the neutral gateway of northern Europe, where we
found the American Minister, Dr. Henry van Dyke, and his first
secretary, Marshall Langhorne, shouldering the work of the American
Legation in its chameleonesque capacity as bank, post-office,
detective bureau, bureau of information, charity organization, and one
might even say temporary home for the stranded travelers of every
rank and nation.

Antwerp, the temporary capital of Belgium, was at this time invested,
but not yet besieged, by the German army.  On the south the city was
already cut off by several regiments of the Ninth and Tenth German
Army Corps under General von Boehn.  The River Scheldt and the
Dutch border formed a wall on the north and west.  It was to Antwerp,
therefore, that we determined to go.  After listening to the usual flood
of warnings against entering the fighting zone, and drinking our fill of
stories of atrocity and hate which every refugee brought across the
border into Holland, we took a couple of reefs in our baggage, and,
hoisting our knapsacks, set our course for the temporary Belgian
capital.  By rail we traveled south across the level fields and lush
green meadows of Holland, over bridges ready to be dynamited in
case of invasion, and through training camps of the 450,000 Dutch
soldiers then mobilized along the border.  At a little town called
Eschen the train stopped because the Belgians had torn up the
tracks.

Seated on the cross-piece of a joggling two-wheeled ox cart, moving
at the rate of not more than four miles an hour, with a dumb
specimen for a driver, and a volume of Baedeker for interpreter and
guide, we got our first glimpse of the hideous thing called war.
Judging from the looks of the country and the burning villages, we
were on the heels of a devastating army.  For three, four, and five
miles on either side of the road beautiful trees lay flat upon the
ground.  It was not until we saw groups of Belgian soldiers tearing
down their own walls and hedges and applying match and gasolene
to those which still stood, that we realized that this was a case of
self-inflicted destruction.  Farmhouses, stores, churches, old Belgian
mansions, and windmills were either in flames or smouldering ruins.
Where burning had not been sufficient, powder and dynamite had
been applied to destroy landmarks which for centuries had been the
country's pride.  As far as the eye could reach the countryside was
flattened to a desert.  It reminded me of the Salem fire, through which,
while the piles of debris were still smoking, I had been taken in the
"Boston Journal's" car.  But instead of a single town, here for twenty
miles along lay stretched a smouldering waste.  The devastation was
for the defensive purpose of giving an unobstructed view to the
cannon of Antwerp's outer fortifications, which on that side covered
one sector of the circle swept by her enormous guns.  I should
hesitate to mention the millions of dollars of self-inflicted damage to
Antwerp's suburbs alone.  Luther and I did not at the time have the
military password.  So that first day was a specimen in the matter of
hold-ups and arrests.  From the time that we started across the level
plains which approach the city until we got through the double sector
of forts, we were stopped, questioned, and searched by thirteen
different groups of soldiers.  There were marry occasions where, after
one pair of stupid sentries had put us through the grill, a second pair,
watching from a distance of thirty yards or so, promptly repeated the
entire performance.  As these fellows spoke only Flemish dialect, our
conversations were not particularly fluent.  Frequently there gathered
around us a crowd of gaping peasants, and when the word
"Americaine" came out, there were "Oh's" and "Ah" of astonishment,
or as often, when our explanations were not believed, sibilant hisses
that shaped themselves into the menacing word "Spion." We had
been led to believe that sooner or later a wool-witted sentry would
shoot first and investigate later; but so far they had simply crossed
bayonets, or with their hands up and palms outward had signaled us
to halt.

Our experience that day, as later events proved, was not an
extraordinary occurrence for war-time, especially for those
endeavoring to gain entrance to an invested city.  But as our first and
maiden adventure it somewhat shook our nerve.  When the grilling
was over we felt about as guilty as any criminal who has been put
through the third degree as practiced in the old police department
days, and I had several times to look over my passport and letters of
credentials to persuade myself that I was really not a spy.  Eventually
we were permitted to pass the gates of the Gare du Nord.  Once
inside the city gates, we made our way into the Place Verte and went
directly to the Hotel St. Antoine, whose proprietor sent our names to
police headquarters.  The St. Antoine was at that time the residence
of the diplomatic corps and the Belgian ministers of state, and was
fifty yards from the Royal Palace and across the street from
headquarters of the Belgian General Staff.

There is no need of describing in detail Antwerp at the time of my first
visit.  One or two pictures will suffice to give a rough idea of its
existence up to the time of the bombardment.  Try to imagine, for
example, going about your business in New York or Boston or Los
Angeles (of course Antwerp is smaller than these) when your country,
a territory perhaps the size of the New England States, was already
two thirds overrun, burnt, smashed, and conquered by a hostile
nation, whose forces were now within nineteen miles of the gates of
the capital.  Imagine that nation's warriors in the act of crushing your
tiny army, whose remnants were already exhausted and on the verge
of despair.  Then picture a quaint, sleepy city, with shadowy alleys and
twisting, gabled streets, in which every other store and house was
decorated with King Albert's picture or draped in the red, black, and
yellow banner of the country-a city whose atmosphere was charged
with fear and suspicion and excitement.  Sometimes a crowd of a
thousand or two drew one toward the Central Station where
bedraggled refugee families, just arrived from Liege, Termonde,
Aerschot, and Malines, stood on street corner or wagon top and
thrilled the crowd with tales of atrocities and the story of their flight
from their burning homes to the south.  Now and then the crowd
parted before the clanging bell of a Red Cross ambulance rushing its
load of bleeding bodies to the hospitals along the Place de Meir.
Nurses, male or female, clung to the ambulance steps.  The first one I
saw made a vivid impression on me.  She was an English-looking girl
in a new khaki skirt, supporting with one hand what was left of a
blood-dripping head,--the eyes and nose were shot away,--while
out of the other hand she ate with apparent relish a thick rye-bread
sandwich.  Occasionally she waved remnants of the sandwich at the
gaping crowd.  It struck me as a peculiarly unnecessary exhibition of
her callous fitness for the job of nurse.

During the daytime the ordinary things of life went on, for the good
burghers and shopkeepers went about their business as usual, and,
generally speaking, fought against fear as bravely as the soldiers in
the trenches stood up against the German howitzers.  It was only after
dark (when martial law permitted no lights of any kind) that the city
seemed to shiver and suck in its breath; doors were barricaded, iron
shutters came down, and behind them the people talked in whispers.
Military autos, fresh from the firing line, groaned and sputtered at the
doorstep of the St. Antoine; soldiers with pocket lanterns stamped
about the streets.  From sheer nervousness after a day of
confinement some citizens, in spite of warnings, groped about the
more important avenues at night.  Picture yourself on Broadway or
Tremont Street, with not a light on the street gleaming from a window,
and walking up and down with one hand on your wallet and the other
in the pocket where your Colt automatic ought to be.

Such, very briefly, was the condition of Antwerp at the time when we
arrived.  That very evening word came in that the Belgian forces,
which had been engaged with the enemy for five consecutive days of
severe fighting, had retired behind the southern ramparts of the city.

During the night the stream of incoming wounded confirmed the news
of battle.  In the moonlight, and later in the gray dawn, I watched the
long lines of Belgian hounds, pulling their rapid-fire guns out toward
the trenches.  Many times later I was destined to see them.  They
made a picturesque and stimulating sight--those faithful dogs of war
--fettered and harnessed, their tongues hanging out as they lay
patiently beneath the gun trucks awaiting the order to go into action,
or, when the word had been given, trotted along the dusty roads,
each pair tugging to the battle front a lean, gray engine of destruction.

For our purpose the best approach to Brussels was by way of Ghent.
Luther pushed on ahead while I was finishing a story.  The following
morning, shouldering my knapsack, which now contained an extra
supply of army rations, and carefully stuffing my different sets of
credentials in different pockets (one for Belgian, one for German, and
one for English consumption), I crossed the River Scheldt and made
a slow and tortuous railway journey to Ghent.

Ghent lies thirty miles west of Antwerp.  The trip took seven hours.
During the course of it I passed north of the Belgian lines and through
the western sector of forts, that is to say, Fort St. Nicholas, Fort
Haesdonck, and Fort Tete de Flandre.  It was the same road along
which Winston Churchill's English marines and the remnant of the
Belgian forces retreated after the fall of Antwerp.

Ghent resounded with praises of its American Vice-Consul, Julius
Van Hee, a hair-trigger politician and a live wire if there ever was one.
Van Hee, with his intimate knowledge of four languages and the
Yankee knack of being on the right spot at the right time, twice saved
blood-shed in the streets of Ghent and in one instance probably
prevented a repetition of the scenes at Louvain.

In Ghent I again found Luther, with a fine young rumor in his pocket
--a rumor which turned out to be correct--that six German spies were
to be executed next morning at sunrise.  The place mentioned was
behind the museum in a public park.

"I suppose we'll take it in," said Luther.

"I don't know about that," I answered; adding that, although
executions might be part of the day's work for a war correspondent, I
drew the line at seeing my first murder before breakfast.  The tip was
correct enough except that it mentioned the wrong park.

The following noon the Military Governor, according to regulations,
caused to be posted circulars announcing that the men had been put
to death; but at all events I am glad to say that at that early date I did
not have the experience of watching six blindfolded wretches backed
up against a wall, of seeing the officer drop his arm as a signal, and
of hearing the fatal crack of a dozen muskets, as the bodies
collapsed like a telescope, crumpled inward with the chin upon the
chest, and fell forward to the earth.




Chapter II

The Second Bombardment Of Termonde



September 15th was our day with Henry Verhagen, the tall gray
alderman of the town that was once Termonde.

During all the time I was with him Verhagen did not speak a bitter
word.  On the contrary, he was calm--particularly calm as he stood
beside the mound where the Belgian soldiers were buried in the
center of the ruined town, pointed to the pile of bricks where he had
lived, and told us how in two nights he had lost 340,000 francs, his
son, his factory, and his home.  It was from him, from the
burgomaster's wife, and from a priest that we learned the story of the
city that had ceased to be.

It was the night before that I had wandered into Ghent alone, without
even the excitement of getting arrested.  Luther, who became restive
early the next morning while I was jotting notes in the log-book, went
off in search of adventure.  Because of the influence exerted by Vice-
Consul Van Hee an arrangement was very soon made whereby a Belgian
Government car and chauffeur were placed at our disposal. We had no
laissez-passer for the firing line; but we were accompanied by the
United States Consul and not governed by any stipulation as to our
destination.  In our Belgian car, decorated with all the American flags
we could find, and "American Consular Service" pasted in huge letters on
the windshield and side flaps, we raced along the Boulevard de
l'lndustrie, swung into the southern suburbs, and, once outside the city
limits, we opened up the exhaust and threw down the throttle as Van Hee
shouted out the order:--"To Termonde!"

Termonde was at that time the scene of determined fighting between
units of the ninth German Corps and the Belgian defenders.  Situated
as it is, twenty-one miles southeast of Ghent, it marks the southwest
corner of a square formed by Louvain and Termonde on the south,
by Ghent and Antwerp on the north.  It controlled the bridge over the
River Scheldt and with it an important approach to Antwerp, the
capital at that time of Belgium.  The heavy German siege guns,
capable of demolishing a first-class fort at a range of several miles,
could not have crossed the river so easily at any other point.  For this
reason the Germans particularly wanted Termonde--an open bridge
to Antwerp was always worth the taking.  The town had already at that
time been captured and recaptured; wounded and refugees were
swarming into Ghent full of battle stories and tales of terrible
atrocities.  So it was Termonde that we vowed we would see.

We first saw Verhagen trudging in the same direction as ourselves on
the level, dusty road two miles southwest of Ghent.  As we
approached a cross-road marked by a tavern, a couple of
direction-posts, and nondescript stucco buildings, we made out two
Belgian sentries, with their rifles lifted overhead and indulging in
some acrobatic exercises which we interpreted as a signal to halt.  Van
Hee swapped cigarettes with them and gossiped in their native tongue, in
return for which they gave us some good advice.  They warned us to pay
no attention to sign-posts, which, in order to fool the enemy, were
either marked with false names or else were pointed in the wrong
direction.  While we were talking, a tall gray alderman came along the
road with a greasy package under his arm and at his side a priest--one
of those ubiquitous black-robed figures with a hat like an inverted
oatmeal bowl.

"Where to?" asked the Vice-Consul of Ghent.

"A Dendermonde," (to Termonde), answered Verhagen, sizing us up
as strangers, and using French instead of the local Flemish dialect.

"You know the road?"

"Yes, well," said Verhagen; and so, partly because of charity and
partly because we could have him as a useful guide, we took him into
the car.

As we sped through the level lanes of poplars, challenged as usual
by every Belgian regular or Garde Civique who could boast a uniform,
the smooth green meadows of Flanders with their trim hamlets of
stucco and tile seemed to deny the reports of savagery we had heard
the night before.  We had been told, and we had read, of German
atrocities, and we had talked with survivors of Louvain.  There was
pillage, burning, and looting in Louvain, we had agreed, but the
cruelty to women and children was the better part myth.  And at all
events, there was a semblance of cause for that.  Perhaps there had
been more resistance, more sniping by citizens than generally known,
and perhaps the German side had not been fully explained.

Then suddenly Termonde lay before us.  The center of the bridge was
gone.  Splintered timber sticking on end lay in the mud at the river's
side, along with iron beams torn by the charges of dynamite.  The
current was choked with masses of steel and wood.  We crawled
across some temporary beams reconstructed by Belgian engineers,
and entered the ruins with a handful of Termonde's citizens who had
come back for the first time to see what was left of their homes.

"I will take you to the center," said Verhagen.  "That is where my
house was."

A quarter of a mile behind us, as the alderman sat upon a rock
beside the gravestone, lay the thin neck of the Upper Scheldt, less
than one hundred yards wide at this point, where it curved between
the lines of charred and flattened buildings.  We could still see the
rush of water tumbling and splashing through the wreckage of the
bridge we had just crossed.  Twice it had been dynamited and twice
rebuilt in part, so that at present a single line of slippery beams,
suspended a few feet above the water and supported by some heavy
wire, was all that remained between ourselves and the retreating road
to Ghent.  From the direction of Alost came the desultory boom of
German guns; across the stream behind us the Belgian outposts
whiled away the time with cigarettes and cards.  Shaggy horses dozed
against the gun trucks, and the men of artillery, some stretched at full
length in the sun, others sitting bolt upright with arms folded, slept
soundly on the gun carriages.  We could hear the stream gurgling.  We
could hear the creak of a lazy windmill, and, coming somewhere from
the smoking piles, the hideous howl of starving hounds.  Of other
human sounds there were none except the voice of Verhagen.

Ten days before Termonde had been a thriving town; that day it was
a heap of smouldering ashes.  America had heard a good deal about
Tirlemont and Louvain, but not much of Termonde.  Because this was
a war of millions, it did not count in the news--for it was only a
community of twelve thousand inhabitants, as pretty and quaint as
the province of Flanders boasts, the prosperous center of its rope
and cordage manufacture, with fifteen hundred houses, barracks, two
statues, a town-hall, five churches, an orphan asylum, and a convent.

Now only one of the churches stood, as well as the building where the
officers were quartered, the Museum of Antiquity, and perhaps a
dozen others.  Across the moat, which led to the gateway of what
were formerly the inner fortifications, were piles of rotting horseflesh.
The bronze statue of De Smet, the Jesuit missionary, looked calmly
on the scene.  All the rest was blotted out.  There was no sign of
hot-tempered impetuous work of a handful of drunken Uhlans, a fire
started in anger and driven by the wind throughout the entire town.
There was not a breath of wind.  That the night was calm was shown
by the fact that here and there single houses, even houses built of
boards, were spared at the commander's word.  The convent was
burnt and pillaged, stones and mortar littered the street in front of the
Hotel de Ville, and upon the sidewalk lay the famous bells which
came crashing to the street below when shells burst in the belfry.
From cellar to garret nearly every remaining house was
systematically drenched with naphtha and the torch applied, and
when all was over hundreds of gallons were tossed into the River
Scheldt.  Over a small group of houses in the poorer section of the
city, where the prostitutes were quartered, grim Prussian humor, or
perhaps a sense of value received, had prompted the conquerors to
write in great white chalk marks in German script, "Gute Leute.  Nicht
brennen!" (Good people.  Do not burn!)

For an hour we walked through the silence of ashes and stone,
stumbling over timber and debris, tangled and twisted wire, a fallen
statue, broken bells or the cross-piece of a spire; we made our way
through piles of beds, chairs, singed mattresses, and stepped over
the carcass of a horse with its belly bloated and flies feasting on its
glassy eyes.  We entered an apothecary shop where the clock still
ticked upon the counter.  Thinking there could be no reason of war to
call for the destruction of the orphan asylum, we entered its portals to
investigate.  Before us lay burnt beds and littered glass.  We searched
what ten days before had been a convent, and crawled over heaps of
logs and brick into narrow alleys that reminded one of Naples or
Pompeii--alleys where the walls stood so close as to hide the light
of sun but not the odor of charred vats and sewage and smouldering,
smelling things, long dead.  Not far from there the way widened into
the light, and before us, breaking the rays of sunset, stood the cross
above a heap of cobblestones.

"They are buried here," said Verhagen, "and here too is my house."

Another alderman, a friend of Verhagen, who had been allowed to remain
in Termonde most of the four days that the Germans stayed, had the story
detailed in his little pocket diary.  On Thursday, September 3, he said,
he was just leaving his rope and twine factory when he heard the sounds
of musketry to the south.  A small force of Belgian outposts were
completely surprised by a part of the Ninth German Army Corps under
General von Boehn.  They were completely outclassed.  Before retreating,
however, they let the enemy have a couple of volleys.  In the return
fire they lost six of their men.  They then retreated into the town and
across the bridge.

Nothing happened after dark, but the next morning at nine o'clock the
cannonading started.  Inside of half an hour, according to the villagers,
the entire German force of the One Hundred and Sixty-second and
One Hundred and Sixty-third Uhlans and the Ninetieth Regiment of
infantry of the Ninth Army Corps were in the town.  They entered
simultaneously by three different roads.  The burgomaster was
ordered immediately to provide rations for the regiment.  But the
burgomaster was away.  He was given twelve hours to return.  When
he did not return, the burning began, according to the townspeople.

"The soldiers did not wish to burn the town," said one man; "but the
orders were orders of war." He recounted that four Uhlans entered
his house with a bow, and a knock at the door, politely helped
themselves to his cellar, drank a toast to his wife, put his chairs in the
street, and sat there playing his phonograph.  They said they were
sorry, but the house must be burnt.  But before pouring on the
naphtha and lighting the flame they freed his canary bird.  Verhagen
and the priest agreed that fright brought on an attack to a woman
about to become a mother, and that she fell in the Rue de l'Eglise.
A German lieutenant saw the trouble, put her on a stretcher made of
window shutters, and called the German army doctor.  She was sent
to a field hospital and tenderly cared for until she and the child could
be moved.  Such incidents in strange relief, told by men who had lost
everything, lent corroboration, if such were necessary, to the burden
of their story of the relentless destruction of the town itself.

Our little band was the first to enter the ruins of Termonde after its
abandonment by the Ninth German Army Corps.  And by a coincidence, we
were the last to leave.  That very evening, at precisely the time we
were crawling across the broken timbers that spanned the Scheldt and
connected us with Belgium-owned Belgium, the Germans again pumped heavy
artillery fire into the town.  This was later known as the second German
bombardment and occupation of Termonde.  Because of superior artillery
range, the attack had the cruel advantage of the man who can strike and
still stay out of reach.  On that evening at six-thirty, the Teutons
sent a few warning shells into the debris, and then the first column of
scouts entered simultaneously by the two southern gates.  It was just at
six-thirty that our party started back for Ghent.

As we crawled across on all fours the remaining beams cracked
beneath our feet and the Belgian engineers called on us to hurry.
"Oh, Tiber! Father Tiber," we thought as the last of us got across;
but unlike Horatius at the bridge, we were on the right side when
engineers applied the match to a small charge of dynamite, and the
beams crashed and the remaining planks of Termonde's bridge
writhed and twisted in the rushing waters.

Twenty-seven miles away, when we whirled through the gates of
Ghent later in the evening, we said "Au revoir" to Verhagen and the
mendicant priest, and went to our rooms.  At midnight came a rap at
the door; my gray-haired alderman broke into the room, bursting with
the latest news, his eyes aflame with excitement.

"Revanche!" he exclaimed dramatically; "our enemies have paid for it
in blood!"

Sure enough, after a few preliminary shells--a sort of here-we-come
salvo--the head of the German column had entered, and a party of
staff officers, for purposes of reconnaissance, immediately mounted
the spire of the only remaining church.  The officers of the Ninth
German Army Corps swept the landscape with their glasses, but the
level plains gave nothing to their sight.  They saw only the ashes of
Termonde, the river, and the straight stretch of sandy roads and
stucco hamlets beyond.

They did not notice a valley of covered ground and a quarter-mile
stretch of trees and shrubbery, where three squads of Belgian field
artillery were neatly hidden.  Here the men took cover at the first
sound of cannonade.  Quietly in their retreat the Belgian artillery
officers had figured the range and elevation of the cathedral tower,
not over fifteen hundred yards away.  Just as darkness was setting in
and the figures in the belfry were clearly visible, the battery sergeant
sharply dropped his arm.

"C-r-r-m-p-h!" coughed the field pieces as the gunners drew the
levers home.  There were four sharp reports, four flashes of flame and
smoke, the crescendo moan of tons of flying steel--and the church
tower, the bells, and the German officers came crashing to the
ground.




Chapter III

Captive



Up to the day that Luther and I went through the Belgian trenches
near Alost and got into the hands of the German outposts north of
Brussels, we had not seen nearly as much fighting as we wished.  We
had looked upon the ear-marks and horrible results of battles; had
heard guns, smelt the blood and ether of wounded, and seen the
ruins over which had rolled the wave of battle.  We knew that ahead of
us there had been much fighting in the Sempst-Alost-Vilvorde-
Tirlemont region.  The Germans at that moment, if not actually
advancing toward Antwerp, were skirmishing and making feints in
every direction, with the ultimate disposition of their forces carefully
concealed.  Of course, we had no official permission to be at the front
with either army; in fact, up to that point we had received nothing but
official threats on the subject of what would happen to us in case we
went ahead.  But as no one did more than threaten, we kept on going,
since we preferred that mode of procedure to sitting around in Paris
or Berlin on the chance of one of those "personally conducted" tours
of inspection, whose purpose is to show the correspondent
everything except actual fighting.  It was our hope during that early
part of the war to see as much as possible of the German army,
realizing that, if captured, we should undoubtedly be sent either
backward or forward along the German line of communication in
conquered Belgium.  Once within the German outposts we pleaded
like Brer Rabbit not to be thrown into the German brier patch.  So of
course we landed in it.  After a few days in Brussels they shipped us
Eastward to Aix-la-Chapelle by way of Lou-vain, Tirlemont, and Liege.

It was two days after the second bombardment of Termonde--at 7
A.M., to be exact--that Luther and I started from Ghent for Brussels
in a military automobile, the property of the Belgian Government, and
again loaned for the occasion to Julius Van Hee, American Vice-
Consul, then Acting Consul at Ghent.  We carried with us a United
States Government mail pouch, a packet of mail from Dr. Henry van
Dyke, at The Hague, addressed to Brand Whitlock, the American
Minister at Brussels, and another packet of mail from Henry W.
Diederick, United States Consul-General at Antwerp.  Mr. Van Hee
hoped to obtain from the German authorities in Brussels some
smallpox vaccine to take back to Ghent, where a smallpox epidemic
was feared.

Once out of the town limits of Ghent we bowled along at top speed,
with the American colors trembling fore and aft and impressive-
looking signs pasted on windshield and side-flaps.  The autumn rains
descended heavily upon us, drenching everything except the
carefully protected mail bags.

Six miles southeast of Ghent, we ran into a regiment of Belgian
infantry moving back from the direction of Brussels, and farther on a
squad of cavalry and some more cavalry outposts; then two
companies of bicycle patrol, the men with their heads bent over the
handlebars, Mausers slung over their shoulders, pedaling heavily
through the mud and slush of a cold September storm.  A few
mitrailleuses, known as the Minerva type, and mounted on armored
motor-cars, were trained on the ravine through which the road dipped
a thousand yards ahead of us.  They had sighted the German
outposts on the crest of a hill opposite us about three quarters of a
mile away.  In a very poor kind of trench, hastily constructed in the
beet-fields, and little more than body deep, the men lay on their
bellies in the mud, nervously fingering their muskets and adjusting the
sights.  A third company of bicycle scouts were ordered to advance for
the purpose of drawing fire.

I doubt if that particular body of men had ever before been under fire.
Never was the fear of death more plainly written on human face.  All of
the men went ahead without flinching or failing, but the muscles of
their jaws were knotted, their faces were the color of chalk, and one
or two dismounted for a moment, subject to the physical effects of
fear.  I have seen men tremble before important physical contests:
Jeffries, stepping into the prize ring at Reno, Nevada, ready for the
beating of his life and the loss of reputation.  I have seen murderers
condemned to death.  Charles Becker, as I watched him taking his
death sentence that evening in the Criminal Courts Building, did not
give one the same uncanny feeling as this handful of Belgian scouts
pedaling out to meet the German fire.  I do not intend to say the
Belgians were not brave men, for this was an isolated instance.  And
indeed there was something gruesome about that little company
offered for the slaughter, simply for the purpose of locating the
German batteries.  The men understood the meaning of the order and
appreciated the odds against them.

The mitrailleuses pointed down the road we were headed on, and the
Belgian gun-captain told us they were going to clean things up as soon
as their own scouts drew fire and the first Teuton helmet appeared above
the crest.  Naturally we were ordered back.  Had we continued on this
road we should have been between the Belgian fire behind and the German
fire in front, for the Germans would undoubtedly have mistaken us for a
scouting party in an armored car. As it was, Luther jumped to the wheel
and insisted on seeing the thing through.  We went ahead for about half
a mile.  I told him that if the shrapnel began to burst too close he
would find me tucked safely underneath the car examining the gasoline
tanks or in the nearest farmhouse cellar, and I believe he would have.
But nothing came close to us on that occasion.  My real "baptism" was
reserved for another day, because Van Hee suddenly wrenched the wheel
from Luther and turned our machine down a side road.  It was a case of
out of the firing line into the frying-pan, for the side road led us
into a trap from which there was no turning back--the territory
patrolled by the burly pickets of the Ninth German Army Corps, forming
part of the Kaiser's army of occupation in Brussels.

Out of earshot, and certainly out of sight of that skirmish, we were
speeding at a great rate along a level, lonely road flanked by
beet-fields and long lines of graceful elms that shook hands overhead,
when:

"HALT! WOHIN? WO GEHEN SIE?" rang suddenly out of the darkness
as two figures jumped from behind a farmhouse and leveled their
rifles at us.  I shall always remember that sharp command as the cold,
gray muzzles followed us like a sportsman covering a bevy of quail.
Our fat Belgian chauffeur, violinist in times of peace, and posing that
day as an American,--one of those men who look as if they would
bleed water if you pricked them with a bayonet,--needed no second
warning.  Running the German gauntlet was not precisely his hobby.
Down went the emergency brake and the car jolted to a sudden halt.

A bristle-whiskered German giant under a canvas-covered helmet
stuck his head through the flaps, and for more than ten minutes he
and another sentinel searched our knapsacks and credentials and
inspected the Government mail pouches which we carried.  The
sentries were far from satisfied.  We said little at first, realizing,
nevertheless, that we had run between the opposing trenches and up
to the German outposts without actually drawing fire.  That, at least,
was something of a comfort.

Then, as if the answer was the price of admission, the big one asked
us if we had seen many British soldiers around Antwerp and Ghent.
We had previously decided that the answer to such talk was, "None
of your business." But the fellow's bayonet was infernally bright and
sharp and his countenance like ice.  It wasn't only the equinoctial rain
that made us shiver.

While I was trying to limber up my German vocabulary he passed us
along to his Ober-leutenant in the hut along the roadside.  The Ober-
Ieutenant was grave.  He said we must report to army headquarters
in Brussels, and that under no circumstances should we be allowed
to return within the Belgian lines.  In this way began our eight days'
confinement within the lines of the German Army of the North under
General von Boehn.

Just as we had been warned repeatedly, so we discovered in reality
that to cross between two opposing lines was no joking matter.  Bad
enough, particularly in the early days of the war, to a correspondent
without permission at the front.  To work up from the rear (if you had
permission) was at least according to the rules of the game.  But to
cross between hostile armies--that was the one forbidden act.  The
fact that we were with an American Consul was not sufficient.  Three
days later Van Hee was allowed to return, but the remainder of the
party, that is to say, Willard Luther and myself, were given a free trip
into German territory and incidentally more than a week's chance to
study the German army from within.

Those next eight days Luther and I spent as willing and, on the whole,
decently treated captives within the lines of the German Army of the
North, talking freely with cultivated officers and grimy men of the
ranks, and in this way learning much of the German war machine, the
opinions of the officers and the men at their command.  It would be
interesting to tell how in Brussels we dodged from War Office to cafe,
from cafe to consulate, from consulate back to War Office, and later
were worried and watched and suspected; how we were shipped
back across the German border on a combination Red Cross and
ammunition train; how we were locked for much of the night in a
half-mile tunnel of the northern Vosges Mountains, and there, in the
groping darkness of our box-car prison, shared the soldier's biscuit
and his bottle, so coming to know the Kaiser's private as a
companion and not as the barbarian his enemies paint him.

The day after we got inside the German lines we went before Major
Heinrich Bayer, at that time military commandant in Brussels in the
absence of General von der Goltz.  Jostling through the street and
jamming the courtyard of the War Office was a crowd of a thousand
persons--mothers, children, whole families begging for relief or
permission to leave the city limits; German subjects trying to get
passes, officials and employees of the civil administration taking
orders from the military authorities.  A relay of aides, orderlies, and
secretaries led us from courtyard to corridor and from corridor to staff
headquarters and into the Holy of Holies--the office of the
commandant.

Grim, stern,--but courteous throughout the interview,--the major
paced the floor beside his desk.  He seemed anxious enough to be rid
of the "crazy Americans" who had wandered through the Belgian and
German lines, not altogether satisfied with their integrity, yet not
wishing to take a hostile attitude.  I asked him when he thought the
war would be over.  At the moment the German major, Vice-Consul
Van Hee, and I were the only persons in the room.

"I do not know," he said, as if thinking aloud; "I really do not know.
America is the only country that has not fired on us yet, but all the rest
--" Then he added thoughtfully, "Perhaps it is better that you go.  But
you cannot return to Ghent or Antwerp; you must go back to
Germany." He stopped as if he had gone too far, and then sharply
commanded the orderly to remove us.  Forty-eight hours later Mr. Van
Hee got his release.  To Luther and myself was given a curious sort of
pass, beset with limitations, which at times caused us royal treatment
and as often proved a fatal baggage tag.  I have always believed a
joker lay hidden somewhere in that document.  It started with a
flattering description of our status (as given by ourselves), but below it
directed us to be taken into Aix-la-Chapelle, Germany, and under no
circumstances to be returned within the Belgian lines.  We had seen a
great deal too much for that.  In spite of our protestations of good faith
and promises to keep dark what we had seen, the military authorities
considered us much safer under German guard.  We were to be
taken on the southern route by way of Namur.  To drive home the
importance of obeying this order we were reminded of the regulation,
printed in French and posted throughout the city, "that whosoever
passed the city limits or approached the fighting line without military
permit, or on the pretense of having such a permit, or whosoever
deviated from the route laid down would be shot 'sur le champ.'" That
same evening, however, army orders declared that the Namur route
was closed.  We got a second War Office pass sending us to Aix by
way of Louvain, Tirlemont, and Liege.  Armed with these we went
down to an old Major Bock von W------, in charge of transportation at
Schaerbeek, on the outskirts of the city.

I showed him the passes and said with a painful attempt at levity,
"Major, we can't obey both of these, so we 're going to get shot either
way we go.  If it is all the same to you I would rather die on your
route." To my great relief the old fellow laid back his gray head and
emitted a series of long, loud Teuton laughs.  He was the first German I
had heard laugh and it did me good.  I knew we were safe.  On the
understanding that the business was strictly confidential and that no
other citizens or suspects were to know of it, he gave us a permit for
the military trains.  It had been the intention of the War Office to
pack us under guard with the herds on one of those Government refugee
trains.  But to live and sleep with the soldiers as we were now to do,
to see their marches, to absorb their uninformed and boastful talk, to
study their guns, munitions, and equipment, was better than our highest
hopes.

"You have to do a lot of quick transporting?" I asked before saying
good-bye to Major von W------.

"Yes," was the answer.  "They 're at us from all sides.  Some of the
men we are now transporting have been under fire in two countries,
and now they will see service in a third." He knew that I had come
from Ghent and from Antwerp, which the Germans were about to
bombard, yet, to his credit, it should be said that he did not ask for
information of Belgian activities.  Similarly, although the soldiers, as a
rule, and one man high in the civil government of Brussels, asked
what was going on in Antwerp, it was noticeable that German officers
recognized the obligations of neutrality.

Of how we left Brussels and of the first part of the eastward trip, I am
going to quote from the jottings in the log-book, which was written up
at some length after we left Aix-la-Chapelle:--

"Early on the morning of the 22d, I went up to Consul Watts's office to
get the mail pouch I had promised him to carry.
