cling to the
dry, crumbling chalk of the cliff-like cutting; flowers bloom on the
verge above, against the line of the sky, and over the dark arch of the
tunnel. This, it is true, is summer; but it is the same in spring.
Before a dandelion has shown in the meadow, the banks of the railway are
yellow with coltsfoot. After a time the gorse flowers everywhere along
them; but the golden broom overtops all, perfect thickets of broom
glowing in the sunlight.

Presently the copses are azure with bluebells, among which the brake is
thrusting itself up; others, again, are red with ragged robins, and the
fields adjacent fill the eye with the gaudy glare of yellow charlock.
The note of the cuckoo sounds above the rushing of the train, and the
larks may be seen, if not heard, rising high over the wheat. Some birds,
indeed, find the bushes by the railway the quietest place in which to
build their nests.

Butcher-birds or shrikes are frequently found on the telegraph wires;
from that elevation they pounce down on their prey, and return again to
the wire. There were two pairs of shrikes using the telegraph wires for
this purpose one spring only a short distance beyond noisy Clapham
Junction. Another pair came back several seasons to a particular part of
the wires, near a bridge, and I have seen a hawk perched on the wire
equally near London.

The haze hangs over the wide, dark plain, which, soon after passing
Redhill, stretches away on the right. It seems to us in the train to
extend from the foot of a great bluff there to the first rampart of the
still distant South Downs. In the evening that haze will be changed to a
flood of purple light veiling the horizon. Fitful glances at the
newspaper or the novel pass the time; but now I can read no longer, for
I know, without any marks or tangible evidence, that the hills are
drawing near. There is always hope in the hills.

The dust of London fills the eyes and blurs the vision; but it
penetrates deeper than that. There is a dust that chokes the spirit, and
it is this that makes the streets so long, the stones so stony, the desk
so wooden; the very rustiness of the iron railings about the offices
sets the teeth on edge, the sooty blackened walls (yet without shadow)
thrust back the sympathies which are ever trying to cling to the
inanimate things around us. A breeze comes in at the carriage window--a
wild puff, disturbing the heated stillness of the summer day. It is easy
to tell where that came from--silently the Downs have stolen into sight.

So easy is the outline of the ridge, so broad and flowing are the
slopes, that those who have not mounted them cannot grasp the idea of
their real height and steepness. The copse upon the summit yonder looks
but a short stroll distant; how much you would be deceived did you
attempt to walk thither! The ascent here in front seems nothing, but you
must rest before you have reached a third of the way up. Ditchling
Beacon there, on the left, is the very highest above the sea of the
whole mighty range, but so great is the mass of the hill that the glance
does not realise it.

Hope dwells there, somewhere, mayhap, in the breeze, in the sward, or
the pale cups of the harebells. Now, having gazed at these, we can lean
back on the cushions and wait patiently for the sea. There is nothing
else, except the noble sycamores on the left hand just before the train
draws into the station.

The clean dry brick pavements are scarcely less crowded than those of
London, but as you drive through the town, now and then there is a
glimpse of a greenish mist afar off between the houses. The green mist
thickens in one spot almost at the horizon; or is it the dark nebulous
sails of a vessel? Then the foam suddenly appears close at hand--a white
streak seems to run from house to house, reflecting the sunlight: and
this is Brighton.

"How different the sea looks away from the pier!" It is a new pleasure
to those who have been full of gaiety to see, for once, the sea itself.
Westwards, a mile beyond Hove, beyond the coastguard cottages, turn
aside from the road, and go up on the rough path along the ridge of
shingle. The hills are away on the right, the sea on the left; the yards
of the ships in the basin slant across the sky in front.

With a quick, sudden heave the summer sea, calm and gleaming, runs a
little way up the side of the groyne, and again retires. There is scarce
a gurgle or a bubble, but the solid timbers are polished and smooth
where the storms have worn them with pebbles. From a grassy spot ahead
a bird rises, marked with white, and another follows it; they are
wheatears; they frequent the land by the low beach in the autumn.

A shrill but feeble pipe is the cry of the sandpiper, disturbed on his
moist feeding-ground. Among the stones by the waste places there are
pale-green wrinkled leaves, and the large yellow petals of the
sea-poppy. The bright colour is pleasant, but it is a flower best left
ungathered, for its odour is not sweet. On the wiry sward the light pink
of the sea-daisies (or thrift) is dotted here and there: of these gather
as you will. The presence even of such simple flowers, of such
well-known birds, distinguishes the solitary from the trodden beach. The
pier is in view, but the sea is different here.

Drive eastwards along the cliffs to the rough steps cut down to the
beach, descend to the shingle, and stroll along the shore to
Rottingdean. The buttresses of chalk shut out the town if you go to
them, and rest near the large pebbles heaped at the foot. There is
nothing but the white cliff, the green sea, the sky, and the slow ships
that scarcely stir.

In the spring, a starling comes to his nest in a cleft of the cliff
above; he shoots over from the dizzy edge, spreads his wings, borne up
by the ascending air, and in an instant is landed in his cave. On the
sward above, in the autumn, the yellow lip of the toad-flax, spotted
with orange, peers from the grass as you rest and gaze--how far?--out
upon the glorious plain.

Or go up on the hill by the race-course, the highest part near the sea,
and sit down there on the turf. If the west or south wind blow ever so
slightly the low roar of the surge floats up, mingling with the rustle
of the corn stacked in shocks on the slope. There inhale unrestrained
the breeze, the sunlight, and the subtle essence which emanates from
the ocean. For the loneliest of places are on the borders of a gay
crowd, and thus in Brighton--the by-name for all that is crowded and
London-like--it is possible to dream on the sward and on the shore.

In the midst, too, of this most modern of cities, with its swift,
luxurious service of Pullman cars, its piers, and social pleasures,
there exists a collection which, in a few strokes, as it were, sketches
the ways and habits and thoughts of old rural England. It is not easy to
realise in these days of quick transit and still quicker communication
that old England was mostly rural.

There were towns, of course, seventy years ago, but even the towns were
penetrated with what, for want of a better word, may be called country
sentiment. Just the reverse is now the case; the most distant hamlet
which the wanderer in his autumn ramblings may visit, is now more or
less permeated with the feelings and sentiment of the city. No written
history has preserved the daily life of the men who ploughed the Weald
behind the hills there, or tended the sheep on the Downs, before our
beautiful land was crossed with iron roads; while news, even from the
field of Waterloo, had to travel slowly. And, after all, written history
is but words, and words are not tangible.

But in this collection of old English jugs, and mugs, and bowls, and
cups, and so forth, exhibited in the Museum, there is the real
presentment of old rural England. Feeble pottery has ever borne the
impress of man more vividly than marble. From these they quenched their
thirst, over these they laughed and joked, and gossiped, and sang old
hunting songs till the rafters rang, and the dogs under the table got up
and barked. Cannot you see them? The stubbles are ready now once more
for the sportsmen.

With long-barrelled flint-lock guns they ranged over that wonderful map
of the land which lies spread out at your feet as you look down from the
Dyke. There are already yellowing leaves; they will be brown after a
while, and the covers will be ready once more for the visit of the
hounds. The toast upon this mug would be very gladly drunk by the
agriculturist of to-day in his silk hat and black coat. It is just what
he has been wishing these many seasons.

     "Here's to thee, mine honest friend,
     Wishing these hard times to mend."

Hard times, then, are nothing new.

"It is good ale," is the inscription on another jug; that jug would be
very welcome if so filled in many a field this very day. "Better luck
still" is a jug motto which every one who reads it will secretly respond
to. Cock-fighting has gone by, but we are even more than ever on the
side of fair play, and in that sense can endorse the motto, "May the
best cock win." A cup desires that fate should give

     "Money to him who has spirit to use it,
     And life to him who has courage to lose it."

A mug is moderate of wishes and somewhat cynical:--

     "A little health, a little wealth,
       A little house, and freedom;
     And at the end a little friend,
       And little cause to need him."

The toper, if he drank too deep, sometimes found a frog or newt at the
bottom (in china)--a hint not to be too greedy. There seem to have been
sad dogs about in those days from the picture on this piece--one
sniffing regretfully at the bunghole of an empty barrel:--

     "This cask when stored with gin I loved to taste,
     But now a smell, alas! must break my fast."

Upon a cup a somewhat Chinese arrangement of words is found:--

       More       beer       score      Clarke
       for        my         the        his
       do         trust      pay        sent
       I          I          must       has
       shall      if         you        maltster
       what       for        and        the

These parallel columns can be deciphered by beginning at the last word,
"the," on the right hand, and reading up. With rude and sometimes grim
humour our forefathers seem to have been delighted. The teapots of our
great grandmothers are even more amusingly inscribed and illustrated. At
Gretna Green the blacksmith is performing a "Red-Hot Marriage," using
his anvil for the altar.

     "Oh! Mr. Blacksmith, ease our pains,
     And tie us fast in wedlock's chains."

The china decorated with vessels and alluding to naval matters shows how
popular was the navy, and how deeply everything concerning Nelson's men
had sunk into the minds of the people. Some of the line of battleships
here represented are most cleverly executed--every sail and rope and gun
brought out with a clearness which the best draughtsman could hardly
excel. It is a little hard, however, to preserve the time-honoured
imputation upon Jack's constancy in this way on a jug:--

     "A sailor's life's a pleasant life,
       He freely roams from shore to shore;
     In every port he finds a wife--
       What can a sailor wish for more?"

Some enamoured potter having produced a masterpiece as a present to his
lady destroyed the design, so that the service he gave her might be
unique. After gazing at these curious old pieces, with dates of 1754,
1728, and so forth, the mind becomes attuned to such times, and the jug
with the inscription, "Claret, 1652," seems quite an easy and natural
transition.

From the Brighton of to-day it is centuries back to 1754; but from 1754
to 1652 is but a year or two. And after studying these shelves, and
getting, as it were, so deep down in the past, it is with a kind of Rip
Van Winkle feeling that you enter again into the sunshine of the day.
The fair upon the beach does not seem quite real for a few minutes.

Before the autumn is too far advanced and the skies are uncertain, a few
hours should be given to that massive Down which fronts the traveller
from London, Ditchling Beacon, the highest above the sea-level. It is
easy of access, the train carries you to Hassock's Gate--the station is
almost in a copse--and an omnibus runs from it to a comfortable inn in
the centre of Ditchling village. Thence to the Down itself the road is
straight and the walk no longer than is always welcome after riding.

After leaving the cottages and gardens, the road soon becomes enclosed
with hedges and trees, a mere country lane; and how pleasant are the
trees after the bare shore and barren sea! The hand of autumn has
browned the oaks, and has passed over the hedge, reddening the haws. The
north wind rustles the dry hollow stalks of plants upon the mound, and
there is a sense of hardihood in the touch of its breath.

The light is brown, for a vapour conceals the sun--it is not like a
cloud, for it has no end or outline, and it is high above where the
summer blue was lately. Or is it the buff leaves, the grey stalks, the
dun grasses, the ripe fruit, the mist which hides the distance that
makes the day so brown? But the ditches below are yet green with
brooklime and rushes. By a gateway stands a tall campanula or
bell-flower, two feet high or nearly, with great bells of blue.

A passing shepherd, without his sheep, but walking with his crook as a
staff, stays and turns a brown face towards me when I ask him the way.
He points with his iron crook at a narrow line which winds up the Down
by some chalk-pits; it is a footpath from the corner of the road. Just
by the corner the hedge is grey with silky flocks of clematis; the
hawthorn is hidden by it. Near by there is a bush, made up of branches
from five different shrubs and plants.

First hazel, from which the yellow leaves are fast dropping; among this
dogwood, with leaves darkening; between these a bramble bearing berries,
some red and some ripe, and yet a pink flower or two left. Thrusting
itself into the tangle, long woody bines of bittersweet hang their
clusters of red berries, and above and over all the hoary clematis
spreads its beard, whitening to meet the winter. These five are all
intermixed and bound up together, flourishing in a mass; nuts and edible
berries, semi-poisonous fruit, flowers, creepers; and hazel, with
markings under its outer bark like a gun-barrel.

This is the last of the plain. Now every step exposes the climber to the
force of the unchecked wind. The harebells swing before it, the bennets
whistle, but the sward springs to the foot, and the heart grows lighter
as the height increases. The ancient hill is alone with the wind. The
broad summit is left to scattered furze and fern cowering under its
shelter. A sunken fosse and earthwork have slipped together. So lowly
are they now after these fourteen hundred years that in places the long
rough grass covers and conceals them altogether.

Down in the hollow the breeze does not come, and the bennets do not
whistle, yet gazing upwards at the vapour in the sky I fancy I can hear
the mass, as it were, of the wind going over. Standing presently at the
edge of the steep descent looking into the Weald, it seems as if the
mighty blast rising from that vast plain and glancing up the slope like
an arrow from a tree could lift me up and bear me as it bears a hawk
with outspread wings.

A mist which does not roll along or move is drawn across the immense
stage below like a curtain. There is indeed, a brown wood beneath; but
nothing more is visible. The plain is the vaster for its vague
uncertainty. From the north comes down the wind, out of the brown autumn
light, from the woods below and twenty miles of stubble. Its stratum and
current is eight hundred feet deep.

Against my chest, coming up from the plough down there (the old plough,
with the shaft moving on a framework with wheels), it hurls itself
against the green ramparts, and bounds up savagely at delay. The ears
are filled with a continuous sense of something rushing past; the
shoulders go back square; an iron-like feeling enters into the sinews.
The air goes through my coat as if it were gauze, and strokes the skin
like a brush.

The tide of the wind, like the tide of the sea, swirls about, and its
cold push at the first causes a lifting feeling in the chest--a gulp and
pant--as if it were too keen and strong to be borne. Then the blood
meets it, and every fibre and nerve is filled with new vigour. I cannot
drink enough of it. This is the north wind.

High as is the hill, there are larks yonder singing higher still,
suspended in the brown light. Turning away at last and tracing the
fosse, there is at the point where it is deepest and where there is
some trifling shelter, a flat hawthorn bush. It has grown as flat as a
hurdle, as if trained espalierwise or against a wall--the effect, no
doubt, of the winds. Into and between its gnarled branches, dry and
leafless, furze boughs have been woven in and out, so as to form a
shield against the breeze. On the lee of this natural hurdle there are
black charcoal fragments and ashes, where a fire has burnt itself out;
the stick still leans over on which was hung the vessel used at this
wild bivouac.

Descending again by the footpath, the spur of the hill yonder looks
larger and steeper and more ponderous in the mist; it seems higher than
this, a not unusual appearance when the difference in altitude is not
very great. The level we are on seems to us beneath the level in the
distance, as the future is higher than the present. In the hedge or
scattered bushes, half-way down by the chalk-pit, there grows a
spreading shrub--the wayfaring tree--bearing large, broad, downy leaves
and clusters of berries, some red and some black, flattened at their
sides. There are nuts, too, here, and large sloes or wild bullace. This
Ditchling Beacon is, I think, the nearest and the most accessible of the
southern Alps from London; it is so near it may almost be said to be in
the environs of the capital. But it is alone with the wind.




THE SOUTHDOWN SHEPHERD


The shepherd came down the hill carrying his greatcoat slung at his back
upon his crook, and balanced by the long handle projecting in front. He
was very ready and pleased to show his crook, which, however, was not so
symmetrical in shape as those which are represented upon canvas. Nor was
the handle straight; it was a rough stick--the first, evidently, that
had come to hand.

As there were no hedges or copses near his walks, he had to be content
with this bent wand till he could get a better. The iron crook itself he
said was made by a blacksmith in a village below. A good crook was often
made from the barrel of an old single-barrel gun, such as in their
decadence are turned over to the bird-keepers.

About a foot of the barrel being sawn off at the muzzle end, there was a
tube at once to fit the staff into, while the crook was formed by
hammering the tough metal into a curve upon the anvil. So the gun--the
very symbol of destruction--was beaten into the pastoral crook, the
emblem and implement of peace. These crooks of village workmanship are
now subject to competition from the numbers offered for sale at the
shops at the market towns, where scores of them are hung up on show, all
exactly alike, made to pattern, as if stamped out by machinery.

Each village-made crook had an individuality, that of the
blacksmith--somewhat rude, perhaps, but distinctive--the hand shown in
the iron. While talking, a wheatear flew past, and alighted near the
path--a place they frequent. The opinion seems general that wheatears
are not so numerous as they used to be. You can always see two or three
on the Downs in autumn, but the shepherd said years ago he had heard of
one man catching seventy dozen in a day.

Perhaps such wholesale catches were the cause of the comparative
deficiency at the present day, not only by actual diminution of numbers,
but in partially diverting the stream of migration. Tradition is very
strong in birds (and all animated creatures); they return annually in
the face of terrible destruction, and the individuals do not seem to
comprehend the danger. But by degrees the race at large becomes aware of
and acknowledges the mistake, and slowly the original tracks are
deserted. This is the case with water-fowl, and even, some think, with
sea-fish.

There was not so much game on the part of the hills he frequented as he
had known when he was young, and with the decrease of the game the foxes
had become less numerous. There was less cover as the furze was ploughed
up. It paid, of course, better to plough it up, and as much as an
additional two hundred acres on a single farm had been brought under the
plough in his time. Partridges had much decreased, but there were still
plenty of hares: he had known the harriers sometimes kill two dozen a
day.

Plenty of rabbits still remained in places. The foxes' earths were in
their burrows or sometimes under a hollow tree, and when the word was
sent round the shepherds stopped them for the hunt very early in the
morning. Foxes used to be almost thick. He had seen as many as six
(doubtless the vixen and cubs) sunning themselves on the cliffs at
Beachy Head, lying on ledges before their inaccessible breeding-places,
in the face of the chalk.

At present he did not think there were more than two there. They
ascended and descended the cliff with ease, though not, of course, the
straight wall or precipice. He had known them fall over and be dashed to
pieces, as when fighting on the edge, or in winter by the snow giving
way under them. As the snow came drifting along the summit of the Down
it gradually formed a projecting eave or cornice, projecting the length
of the arm, and frozen.

Something like this may occasionally be seen on houses when the
partially melted snow has frozen again before it could quite slide off.
Walking on this at night, when the whole ground was white with snow, and
no part could be distinguished, the weight of the fox as he passed a
weak place caused it to give way, and he could not save himself. Last
winter he had had two lambs, each a month old, killed by a fox which ate
the heads and left the bodies; the fox always eating the head first,
severing it, whether of a hare, rabbit, duck, or the tender lamb, and
"covering"--digging a hole and burying--that which he cannot finish. To
the buried carcase the fox returns the next night before he kills again.

His dog was a cross with a collie: the old sheep-dogs were shaggier and
darker. Most of the sheep-dogs now used were crossed with the collie,
either with Scotch or French, and were very fast--too fast in some
respects. He was careful not to send them much after the flock,
especially after feeding, when, in his own words, the sheep had "best
walk slow then, like folk"--like human beings, who are not to be
hastened after a meal. If he wished his dog to fetch the flock, he
pointed his arm in the direction he wished the dog to go, and said,
"Put her back." Often it was to keep the sheep out of turnips or wheat,
there being no fences. But he made it a practice to walk himself on the
side where care was needed, so as not to employ the dog unless
necessary.

There is something almost Australian in the wide expanse of South Down
sheepwalks, and in the number of the flocks, to those who have been
accustomed to the small sheltered meadows of the vales, where forty or
fifty sheep are about the extent of the stock on many farms. The land,
too, is rented at colonial prices, but a few shillings per acre, so
different from the heavy meadow rents. But, then, the sheep-farmer has
to occupy a certain proportion of arable land as well as pasture, and
here his heavy losses mainly occur.

There is nothing, in fact, in this country so carefully provided against
as the possibility of an English farmer becoming wealthy. Much downland
is covered with furze; some seems to produce a grass too coarse, so that
the rent is really proportional. A sheep to an acre is roughly the
allowance.

From all directions along the roads the bleating flocks concentrate at
the right time upon the hillside where the sheep-fair is held. You can
go nowhere in the adjacent town except uphill, and it needs no hand-post
to the fair to those who know a farmer when they see him, the stream of
folk tender thither so plainly. It rains, as the shepherd said it would;
the houses keep off the drift somewhat in the town, but when this
shelter is left behind, the sward of the hilltop seems among the clouds.

The descending vapours close in the view on every side. The actual field
underfoot, the actual site of the fair, is visible, but the surrounding
valleys and the Downs beyond them are hidden with vast masses of grey
mist. For a moment, perhaps, a portion may lift as the breeze drives it
along, and the bold, sweeping curves of a distant hill appear, but
immediately the rain falls again and the outline vanishes. The glance
can only penetrate a few hundred yards; all beyond that becomes
indistinct, and some cattle standing higher up the hill are vague and
shadowy.

Like a dew, the thin rain deposits a layer of tiny globules on the coat;
the grass is white with them hurdles, flakes, everything is as it were
the eighth of an inch deep in water. Thus on the hillside, surrounded by
the clouds, the fair seems isolated and afar off. A great cart-horse is
being trotted out before the little street of booths to make him show
his paces; they flourish the first thing at hand--a pole with a red flag
at the end--and the huge frightened animal plunges hither and thither in
clumsy terror. You must look out for yourself and keep an eye over your
shoulder, except among the sheep-pens.

There are thousands of sheep, all standing with their heads uphill. At
the corner of each pen the shepherd plants his crook upright: some of
them have long brown handles, and these are of hazel with the bark on;
others are ash, and one of willow. At the corners, too, just outside,
the dogs are chained, and, in addition, there is a whole row of dogs
fastened to the tent pegs. The majority of the dogs thus collected
together from many miles of the Downs are either collies, or show a very
decided trace of the collie.

One old shepherd, an ancient of the ancients, grey and bent, has spent
so many years among his sheep that he has lost all notice and
observation--there is no "speculation in his eye" for anything but his
sheep. In his blue smock frock, with his brown umbrella, which he has
had no time or thought to open, he stands listening, all intent, to the
conversation of the gentlemen who are examining his pens. He leads a
young restless collie by a chain; the links are polished to a silvery
brightness by continual motion; the collie cannot keep still; now he
runs one side, now the other, bumping the old man, who is unconscious of
everything but the sheep.

At the verge of the pens there stand four oxen with their yokes, and the
long slender guiding-rod of hazel placed lightly across the necks of the
two foremost. They are quite motionless, except their eyes, and the
slender rod, so lightly laid across, will remain without falling. After
traversing the whole field, if you return you will find them exactly in
the same position. Some black cattle are scattered about on the high
ground in the mist, which thickens beyond them, and fills up the immense
hollow of the valley.

In the street of booths there are the roundabouts, the swings, the rifle
galleries--like shooting into the mouth of a great trumpet--the shows,
the cakes and brown nuts and gingerbread, the ale-barrels in a row, the
rude forms and trestle tables; just the same, the very same, we saw at
our first fair five-and-twenty years ago, and a hundred miles away. It
is just the same this year as last, like the ploughs and hurdles, and
the sheep themselves. There is nothing new to tempt the ploughboy's
pennies--nothing fresh to stare at.

The same thing year after year, and the same sounds--the dismal barrel
organs, and brazen instruments, and pipes, wailing, droning, booming.
How melancholy the inexpressible noise when the fair is left behind, and
the wet vapours are settling and thickening around it! But the
melancholy is not in the fair--the ploughboy likes it; it is in
ourselves, in the thought that thus, though the years go by, so much of
human life remains the same--the same blatant discord, the same
monotonous roundabout, the same poor gingerbread.

The ploughs are at work, travelling slowly at the ox's pace up and down
the hillside. The South Down plough could scarcely have been invented;
it must have been put together bit by bit in the slow years--slower than
the ox; it is the completed structure of long experience. It is made of
many pieces, chiefly wood, fitted and shaped and worked, as it were,
together, well seasoned first, built up, like a ship, by cunning of
hand.

None of these were struck out--a hundred a minute--by irresistible
machinery ponderously impressing its will on iron as a seal on wax--a
hundred a minute, and all exactly alike. These separate pieces which
compose the plough were cut, chosen, and shaped in the wheelwright's
workshop, chosen by the eye, guided in its turn by long knowledge of
wood, and shaped by the living though hardened hand of man. So
complicated a structure could no more have been struck out on paper in a
deliberate and single plan than those separate pieces could have been
produced by a single blow.

There are no machine lines--no lines filed out in iron or cut by the
lathe to the draughtsman's design, drawn with straight-edge and ruler on
paper. The thing has been put together bit by bit: how many thousand,
thousand clods must have been turned in the furrows before the idea
arose, and the curve to be given to this or that part grew upon the mind
as the branch grows on the tree! There is not a sharp edge or sharp
corner in it; it is all bevelled and smoothed and fluted as if it had
been patiently carved with a knife, so that, touch it where you will, it
handles pleasantly.

In these curved lines and smoothness, in this perfect adaptability of
means to end, there is the spirit of art showing itself, not with colour
or crayon, but working in tangible material substance. The makers of
this plough--not the designer--the various makers, who gradually put it
together, had many things to consider. The fields where it had to work
were, for the most part, on a slope, often thickly strewn with stones
which jar and fracture iron.

The soil was thin, scarce enough on the upper part to turn a furrow,
deepening to nine inches or so at the bottom. So quickly does the rain
sink in, and so quickly does it dry, that the teams work in almost every
weather, while those in the vale are enforced to idleness. Drain furrows
were not needed, nor was it desirable that the ground should be thrown
up in "lands," rising in the centre. Oxen were the draught animals,
patient enough, but certainly not nimble. The share had to be set for
various depths of soil.

All these are met by the wheel plough, and in addition it fulfils the
indefinite and indefinable condition of handiness. A machine may be
apparently perfect, a boat may seem on paper, and examined on
principles, the precise build, and yet when the one is set to work and
the other floated they may fail. But the wheel plough, having grown up,
as it were, out of the soil, fulfils the condition of handiness.

This handiness, in fact, embraces a number of minor conditions which can
scarcely be reduced to writing, but which constantly occur in practice,
and by which the component parts of the plough were doubtless
unconsciously suggested to the makers. Each has its proper name. The
framework, on wheels in front--the distinctive characteristic of the
plough--is called collectively "tacks," and the shafts of the plough
rest on it loosely, so that they swing or work almost independently,
not unlike a field-gun limbered up.

The pillars of the framework have numerous holes, so that the plough can
be raised or lowered, that the share may dig deep or shallow. Then there
is the "cock-pin," the "road-bat" (a crooked piece of wood), the
"sherve-wright" (so pronounced)--shelvewright (?)--the "rist," and
spindle, besides, of course, the usual coulter and share. When the oxen
arrive at the top of the field, and the first furrow is completed, they
stop, well knowing their duty, while the ploughman moves the iron rist,
and the spindle which keeps it in position, to the other side, and moves
the road-bat so as to push the coulter aside. These operations are done
in a minute, and correspond in some degree to turning the rudder of a
ship. The object is that the plough, which has been turning the earth
one way, shall now (as it is reversed to go downhill) continue to turn
it that way. If the change were not effected when the plough was swung
round, the furrow would be made opposite. Next he leans heavily on the
handles, still standing on the same spot; this lifts the plough, so that
it turns easily as if on a pivot.

Then the oxen "jack round"--that is, walk round--so as to face downhill,
the framework in front turning like the fore-wheels of a carriage. So
soon as they face downhill and the plough is turned, they commence work
and make the second furrow side by side with the first. The same
operation is repeated at the bottom, and thus the plough travels
straight up and down, always turning the furrow the same way, instead
of, as in the valleys, making a short circuit at each end, and throwing
the earth in opposite directions. The result is a perfectly level field,
which, though not designed for it, must suit the reaping-machine better
than the drain furrows and raised "lands" of the valley system.

It is somewhat curious that the steam plough, the most remarkable
application of machinery to agriculture, in this respect resembles the
village-made wheel plough. The plough drawn by steam power in like
manner turns the second furrow side by side into the first, always
throwing the earth the same way, and leaving the ground level. This is
one of its defects on heavy, wet land, as it does not drain the surface.
But upon the slopes of the Downs no drains or raised "lands" are needed,
and the wheel plough answers perfectly.

So perfectly, indeed, does it answer that no iron plough has yet been
invented that can beat it, and while the valleys and plains are now
almost wholly worked with factory-made ploughs, the South Downs are
cultivated with the ploughs made in the villages by the wheelwrights. A
wheelwright is generally regularly employed by two or three farms, which
keep him in constant work. There is not, perhaps, another home-made
implement of old English agriculture left in use; certainly, none at
once so curious and interesting, and, when drawn by oxen, so thoroughly
characteristic.

Under the September sun, flowers may still be found in sheltered places,
as at the side of furze, on the highest of the Downs. Wild thyme
continues to bloom--the shepherd's thyme--wild mignonette, blue
scabious, white dropwort, yellow bedstraw, and the large purple blooms
of greater knapweed. Here and there a blue field gentian is still in
flower; "eggs and bacon" grow beside the waggon tracks. Grasshoppers hop
among the short dry grass; bees and humble-bees are buzzing about, and
there are places quite bright with yellow hawkweeds.

The furze is everywhere full of finches, troops of them; and there are
many more swallows than were flying here a month since. No doubt they
are on their way southwards, and stay, as it were, on the edge of the
sea while yet the sun shines. As the evening falls the sheep come slowly
home to the fold. When the flock is penned some stand panting, and the
whole body at each pant moves to and fro lengthways; some press against
the flakes till the wood creaks; some paw the dry and crumbling ground
(arable), making a hollow in which to lie down.

Rooks are fond of the places where sheep have been folded, and perhaps
that is one of the causes why they so continually visit certain spots in
particular fields to the neglect of the rest.




THE BREEZE ON BEACHY HEAD


The waves coming round the promontory before the west wind still give
the idea of a flowing stream, as they did in Homer's days. Here beneath
the cliff, standing where beach and sand meet, it is still; the wind
passes six hundred feet overhead. But yonder, every larger wave rolling
before the breeze breaks over the rocks; a white line of spray rushes
along them, gleaming in the sunshine; for a moment the dark rock-wall
disappears, till the spray sinks.

The sea seems higher than the spot where I stand, its surface on a
higher level--raised like a green mound--as if it could burst in and
occupy the space up to the foot of the cliff in a moment. It will not do
so, I know; but there is an infinite possibility about the sea; it may
do what it is not recorded to have done. It is not to be ordered, it may
overleap the bounds human observation has fixed for it. It has a potency
unfathomable. There is still something in it not quite grasped and
understood--something still to be discovered--a mystery.

So the white spray rushes along the low broken wall of rocks, the sun
gleams on the flying fragments of the wave, again it sinks and the
rhythmic motion holds the mind, as an invisible force holds back the
tide. A faith of expectancy, a sense that something may drift up from
the unknown, a large belief in the unseen resources of the endless space
out yonder, soothes the mind with dreamy hope.

The little rules and little experiences, all the petty ways of narrow
life, are shut off behind by the ponderous and impassable cliff; as if
we had dwelt in the dim light of a cave, but coming out at last to look
at the sun, a great stone had fallen and closed the entrance, so that
there was no return to the shadow. The impassable precipice shuts off
our former selves of yesterday, forcing us to look out over the sea
only, or up to the deeper heaven.

These breadths draw out the soul; we feel that we have wider thoughts
than we knew; the soul has been living, as it were, in a nutshell, all
unaware of its own power, and now suddenly finds freedom in the sun and
the sky. Straight, as if sawn down from turf to beach, the cliff shuts
off the human world, for the sea knows no time and no era; you cannot
tell what century it is from the face of the sea. A Roman trireme
suddenly rounding the white edge-line of chalk, borne on wind and oar
from the Isle of Wight towards the gray castle at Pevensey (already old
in olden days), would not seem strange. What wonder could surprise us
coming from the wonderful sea?

The little rills winding through the sand have made an islet of a
detached rock by the beach; limpets cover it, adhering like rivet-heads.
In the stillness here, under the roof of the wind so high above, the
sound of the sand draining itself is audible. From the cliff blocks of
chalk have fallen, leaving hollows as when a knot drops from a beam.
They lie crushed together at the base, and on the point of this jagged
ridge a wheatear perches.

There are ledges three hundred feet above, and from these now and then a
jackdaw glides out and returns again to his place, where, when still and
with folded wings, he is but a speck of black. A spire of chalk still
higher stands out from the wall, but the rains have got behind it and
will cut the crevice deeper and deeper into its foundation. Water, too,
has carried the soil from under the turf at the summit over the verge,
forming brown streaks.

Upon the beach lies a piece of timber, part of a wreck; the wood is torn
and the fibres rent where it was battered against the dull edge of the
rocks. The heat of the sun burns, thrown back by the dazzling chalk; the
river of ocean flows ceaselessly, casting the spray over the stones; the
unchanged sky is blue.

Let us go back and mount the steps at the Gap, and rest on the sward
there. I feel that I want the presence of grass. The sky is a softer
blue, and the sun genial now the eye and the mind alike are
relieved--the one of the strain of too great solitude (not the solitude
of the woods), the other of too brilliant and hard a contrast of
colours. Touch but the grass and the harmony returns; it is repose after
exaltation.

A vessel comes round the promontory; it is not a trireme of old Rome,
nor the "fair and stately galley" Count Arnaldus hailed with its seamen
singing the mystery of the sea. It is but a brig in ballast, high out of
the water, black of hull and dingy of sail: still it is a ship, and
there is always an interest about a ship. She is so near, running along
but just outside the reef, that the deck is visible. Up rises her stern
as the billows come fast and roll under; then her bow lifts, and
immediately she rolls, and, loosely swaying with the sea, drives along.

The slope of the billow now behind her is white with the bubbles of her
passage, rising, too, from her rudder. Steering athwart with a widening
angle from the land, she is laid to clear the distant point of
Dungeness. Next, a steamer glides forth, unseen till she passed the
cliff; and thus each vessel that comes from the westward has the charm
of the unexpected. Eastward there is many a sail working slowly into the
wind, and as they approach, talking in the language of flags with the
watch on the summit of the Head.

Once now and then the great _Orient_ pauses on her outward route to
Australia, slowing her engines: the immense length of her hull contains
every adjunct of modern life; science, skill, and civilisation are
there. She starts, and is lost sight of round the cliff, gone straight
away for the very ends of the world. The incident is forgotten, when one
morning, as you turn over the newspaper, there is the _Orient_ announced
to start again. It is like a tale of enchantment; it seems but yesterday
that the Head hid her from view; you have scarcely moved, attending to
the daily routine of life, and scarce recognise that time has passed at
all. In so few hours has the earth been encompassed.

The sea-gulls as they settle on the surface ride high out of the water,
like the mediaeval caravals, with their sterns almost as tall as the
masts. Their unconcerned flight, with crooked wings unbent, as if it
were no matter to them whether they flew or floated, in its peculiar
jerking motion somewhat reminds one of the lapwing--the heron has it,
too, a little--as if aquatic or water-side birds had a common and
distinct action of the wing.

Sometimes a porpoise comes along, but just beyond the reef; looking down
on him from the verge of the cliff, his course can be watched. His dark
body, wet and oily, appears on the surface for two seconds; and then,
throwing up his tail like the fluke of an anchor, down he goes. Now look
forward, along the waves, some fifty yards or so, and he will come up,
the sunshine gleaming on the water as it runs off his back, to again
dive, and reappear after a similar interval. Even when the eye can no
longer distinguish the form, the spot where he rises is visible, from
the slight change in the surface.

The hill receding in hollows leaves a narrow plain between the foot of
the sward and the cliff; it is ploughed, and the teams come to the
footpath which follows the edge; and thus those who plough the sea and
those who plough the land look upon each other. The one sees the vessel
change her tack, the other notes the plough turning at the end of the
furrow. Bramble bushes project over the dangerous wall of chalk, and
grasses fill up the interstices, a hedge suspended in air; but be
careful not to reach too far for the blackberries.

The green sea is on the one hand, the yellow stubble on the other. The
porpoise dives along beneath, the sheep graze above. Green seaweed lines
the reef over which the white spray flies, blue lucerne dots the field.
The pebbles of the beach seen from the height mingle in a faint blue
tint, as if the distance ground them into coloured sand. Leaving the
footpath now, and crossing the stubble to "France," as the wide open
hollow in the down is called by the shepherds, it is no easy matter in
dry summer weather to climb the steep turf to the furze line above.

Dry grass is as slippery as if it were hair, and the sheep have fed it
too close for a grip of the hand. Under the furze (still far from the
summit) they have worn a path--a narrow ledge, cut by their cloven
feet--through the sward. It is time to rest; and already, looking back,
the sea has extended to an indefinite horizon. This climb of a few
hundred feet opens a view of so many miles more. But the ships lose
their individuality and human character; they are so far, so very far,
away, they do not take hold of the sympathies; they seem like
sketches--cunningly executed, but only sketches--on the immense canvas
of the ocean. There is something unreal about them.

On a calm day, when the surface is smooth as if the brimming ocean had
been straked--the rod passed across the top of the measure, thrusting
off the irregularities of wave; when the distant green from long
simmering under the sun becomes pale; when the sky, without cloud, but
with some slight haze in it, likewise loses its hue, and the two so
commingle in the pallor of heat that they cannot be separated--then the
still ships appear suspended in space. They are as much held from above
as upborne from beneath.

They are motionless, midway in space--whether it is sea or air is not to
be known. They neither float nor fly; they are suspended. There is no
force in the flat sail, the mast is lifeless, the hull without impetus.
For hours they linger, changeless as the constellations, still, silent,
motionless, phantom vessels on a void sea.

Another climb up from the sheep path, and it is not far then to the
terrible edge of that tremendous cliff which rises straighter than a
ship's side out of the sea, six hundred feet above the detached rock
below, where the limpets cling like rivet heads, and the sand rills run
around it. But it is not possible to look down to it--the glance of
necessity falls outwards, as a raindrop from the eaves is deflected by
the wind, because it _is_ the edge where the mould crumbles; the
rootlets of the grass are exposed; the chalk is about to break away in
flakes.

You cannot lean over as over a parapet, lest such a flake should detach
itself--lest a mere trifle should begin to fall, awakening a dread and
dormant inclination to slide and finally plunge like it. Stand back; the
sea there goes out and out, to the left and to the right, and how far is
it to the blue overhead? The eye must stay here a long period, and drink
in these distances, before it can adjust the measure, and know exactly
what it sees.

The vastness conceals itself, giving us no landmark or milestone. The
fleck of cloud yonder, does it part it in two, or is it but a third of
the way? The world is an immense cauldron, the ocean fills it, and we
are merely on the rim--this narrow land is but a ribbon to the
limitlessness yonder. The wind rushes out upon it with wild joy;
springing from the edge of the earth, it leaps out over the ocean. Let
us go back a few steps and recline on the warm dry turf.

It is pleasant to look back upon the green slope and the hollows and
narrow ridges, with sheep and stubble and some low hedges, and oxen, and
that old, old sloth--the plough--creeping in his path. The sun is bright
on the stubble and the corners of furze; there are bees humming yonder,
no doubt, and flowers, and hares crouching--the dew dried from around
them long since, and waiting for it to fall again; partridges, too,
corn-ricks, and the roof of a farmhouse by them. Lit with sunlight are
the fields, warm autumn garnering all that is dear to the heart of man,
blue heaven above--how sweet the wind comes from these!--the sweeter for
the knowledge of the profound abyss behind.

Here, reclining on the grass--the verge of the cliff rising a little,
shuts out the actual sea--the glance goes forth into the hollow
unsupported. It is sweeter towards the corn-ricks, and yet the mind will
not be satisfied, but ever turns to the unknown. The edge and the abyss
recall us; the boundless plain, for it appears solid as the waves are
levelled by distance, demands the gaze. But with use it becomes easier,
and the eye labours less. There is a promontory standing out from the
main wall, whence you can see the side of the cliff, getting a flank
view, as from a tower.

The jackdaws occasionally floating out from the ledge are as mere specks
from above, as they were from below. The reef running out from the
beach, though now covered by the tide, is visible as you look down on it
through the water; the seaweed, which lay matted and half dry on the
rocks, is now under the wave. Boats have come round, and are beached;
how helplessly little they seem beneath the cliff by the sea!

On returning homewards towards Eastbourne stay awhile by the tumulus on
the slope. There are others hidden among the furze; butterflies flutter
over them, and the bees hum round by day; by night the nighthawk passes,
coming up from the fields and even skirting the sheds and houses below.
The rains beat on them, and the storm drives the dead leaves over their
low green domes; the waves boom on the shore far down.

How many times has the morning star shone yonder in the East? All the
mystery of the sun and of the stars centres around these lowly mounds.

But the glory of these glorious Downs is the breeze. The air in the
valleys immediately beneath them is pure and pleasant; but the least
climb, even a hundred feet, puts you on a plane with the atmosphere
itself, uninterrupted by so much as the tree-tops. It is air without
admixture. If it comes from the south, the waves refine it; if inland,
the wheat and flowers and grass distil it. The great headland and the
whole rib of the promontory is wind-swept and washed with air; the
billows of the atmosphere roll over it.

The sun searches out every crevice amongst the grass, nor is there the
smallest fragment of surface which is not sweetened by air and light.
Underneath, the chalk itself is pure, and the turf thus washed by wind
and rain, sun-dried and dew-scented, is a couch prepared with thyme to
rest on. Discover some excuse to be up there always, to search for stray
mushrooms--they will be stray, for the crop is gathered extremely early
in the morning--or to make a list of flowers and grasses; to do
anything, and, if not, go always without any pretext. Lands of gold have
been found, and lands of spices and precious merchandise; but this is
the land of health.

There is the sea below to bathe in, the air of the sky up hither to
breathe, the sun to infuse the invisible magnetism of his beams. These
are the three potent medicines of nature, and they are medicines that by
degrees strengthen not only the body but the unquiet mind. It is not
necessary to always look out over the sea. By strolling along the slopes
of the ridge a little way inland there is another scene where hills roll
on after hills till the last and largest hides those that succeed behind
it.

Vast cloud-shadows darken one, and lift their veil from another; like
the sea, their tint varies with the hue of the sky over them. Deep
narrow valleys--lanes in the hills--draw the footsteps downwards into
their solitude, but there is always the delicious air, turn whither you
will, and there is always the grass, the touch of which refreshes.
Though not in sight, it is pleasant to know that the sea is close at
hand, and that you have only to mount to the ridge to view it. At sunset
the curves of the shore westward are filled with a luminous mist.

Or if it should be calm, and you should like to look at the massive
headland from the level of the sea, row out a mile from the beach.
Eastwards a bank of red vapour shuts in the sea, the wavelets--no larger
than those raised by the oar--on that side are purple as if wine had
been spilt upon them, but westwards the ripples shimmer with palest
gold.

The sun sinks behind the summit of the Downs, and slender streaks of
purple are drawn along above them. A shadow comes forth from the cliff;
a duskiness dwells on the water; something tempts the eye upwards, and
near the zenith there is a star.

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations

SIXIÈME PARTIE

1809-1813




1809-1813


En quittant une existence longtemps agitée par les illusions et le
mouvement du pouvoir, je devais songer à m'en créer une qui m'offrit
un mélange de repos, d'intérêt et d'occupations douces. La vie
intérieure seule peut remplacer toutes les chimères. Mais, à l'époque
dont je parle, cette vie intérieure, douce et calme, n'existait que
pour bien peu de gens. Napoléon ne permettait guère de s'y attacher;
il croyait que, pour être à lui, il fallait être hors de soi. Entraîné
par la rapidité des événements, par l'ambition, par l'intérêt de
chaque jour; placé dans cette atmosphère de guerre et de mouvement
politique qui planait sur l'Europe entière, chacun était empêché de
jeter un regard attentif sur sa propre situation; l'existence publique
tenait trop de place dans l'esprit, pour que l'on pût réserver une
seule pensée à l'existence privée. On se trouvait chez soi en passant,
parce qu'il faut prendre du repos quelque part; mais personne n'était
préparé à faire de sa maison son séjour habituel.

Je partageais cette condition qui explique l'indifférence que chacun
portait dans tous les actes de sa vie, et que je me reproche d'avoir
mise dans plusieurs de la mienne. C'est alors que je cherchai à marier
mon neveu, Edmond de Périgord[1]. Il était important que le choix de
la femme que je lui donnerai n'éveillât pas la susceptibilité de
Napoléon, qui ne voulait pas laisser échapper à sa jalouse influence
la destinée d'un jeune homme qui portait un des grands noms de France.
Il croyait que, quelques années auparavant, j'avais influé sur le
refus de ma nièce, la comtesse Just de Noailles[2], qu'il m'avait
demandée pour Eugène de Beauharnais, son fils d'adoption. Quelque
choix que je voulusse faire pour mon neveu, je devais donc trouver
l'empereur mal disposé. Il ne m'aurait pas permis de choisir en
France, car il réservait pour ses généraux dévoués les grands partis
qui s'y trouvaient. Je jetai les yeux au dehors.

  [1] Alexandre-Edmond de Talleyrand-Périgord, né le 2 août 1787; depuis
  duc de Dino, et plus tard, duc de Talleyrand-Périgord.

  [2] Françoise de Talleyrand-Périgord, fille d'Archambauld Joseph,
  comte puis duc de Talleyrand-Périgord, frère de l'auteur. Née en 1785,
  elle épousa en 1803 Just, comte de Noailles, et plus tard duc de Poix,
  qui fut chambellan de l'empereur. Elle mourut en 1863.

J'avais souvent entendu parler, en Allemagne et en Pologne, de la
duchesse de Courlande[3]. Je savais qu'elle était distinguée par la
noblesse de ses sentiments, par l'élévation de son caractère et par
les qualités les plus aimables et les plus brillantes. La plus jeune
de ses filles était à marier[4]. Ce choix ne pouvait que plaire à
Napoléon. Il ne lui enlevait point un parti pour ses généraux qui
auraient été refusés, et il devait même flatter la vanité qu'il
mettait à attirer en France de grandes familles étrangères. Cette
vanité l'avait, quelque temps auparavant, porté à faire épouser au
maréchal Berthier une princesse de Bavière. Je résolus donc de faire
demander pour mon neveu la princesse Dorothée de Courlande, et, pour
que l'empereur Napoléon ne pût pas revenir, par réflexion ou par
caprice, sur une approbation donnée, je sollicitai de la bonté de
l'empereur Alexandre, ami particulier de la duchesse de Courlande, de
demander lui-même à celle-ci la main de sa fille pour mon neveu. J'eus
le bonheur de l'obtenir, et le mariage se fit à Francfort-sur-Mein, le
22 avril 1809.

  [3] Charlotte-Dorothée, comtesse de Medem, veuve de Pierre, dernier
  duc de Courlande et de Semigalle, née le 3 février 1761, mariée le 6
  novembre 1779, veuve le 13 janvier 1800, morte le 20 août 1821.

  [4] Dorothée, princesse de Courlande, née le 21 août 1793, morte en
  1862.

En me déterminant à ne plus prendre part à rien de ce que faisait
l'empereur Napoléon, je restais toutefois assez au courant des
affaires, pour pouvoir bien juger la situation générale, calculer
quelle devait être l'époque et la véritable nature de la catastrophe
qui paraissait inévitable, et chercher les moyens de conjurer pour la
France les maux qu'elle devait produire. Tous mes antécédents, toutes
mes anciennes relations avec les hommes influents des différentes
cours, m'assuraient des facilités pour être instruit de tout ce qui se
passait. Mais je devais en même temps donner à ma manière de vivre un
air d'indifférence et d'inaction qui n'offrit pas la moindre prise aux
soupçons continuels de Napoléon. J'eus la preuve que c'était déjà
s'exposer que de ne le plus servir; car à différentes reprises il me
montra une grande animosité, et me fit plusieurs fois publiquement
des scènes violentes. Elles ne me déplaisaient pas, car la crainte
n'est jamais entrée dans mon âme; et je pourrais presque dire que la
haine qu'il manifestait contre moi lui était plus nuisible qu'à
moi-même. Si ce n'était pas anticiper sur l'ordre des temps, je dirais
que cette haine me maintint dans mon indépendance, et me décida à
refuser le portefeuille des affaires étrangères qu'il me fit, plus
tard, offrir avec insistance. Mais à l'époque où cette offre me fut
faite, je regardais déjà son beau rôle comme fini, car il ne semblait
plus s'appliquer qu'à détruire lui-même tout le bien qu'il avait fait.
Il n'y avait plus pour lui de transaction possible avec les intérêts
de l'Europe. Il avait outragé en même temps les rois et les peuples.

Quelque besoin que l'on eût en France de se faire illusion, on était
forcé de reconnaître, dans le blocus continental, dans l'irritation
naturelle, quoique dissimulée, des cabinets étrangers profondément
blessés, dans les souffrances de l'industrie garrottée par le système
prohibitif; on était forcé de reconnaître, dis-je, l'impossibilité de
voir durer un état de choses qui n'offrait aucune garantie de
tranquillité pour l'avenir. Chaque triomphe, celui de Wagram même,
n'était qu'un obstacle de plus à l'affermissement de l'empereur, et la
main d'une archiduchesse qu'il obtint peu après, ne fut qu'un
sacrifice fait par l'Autriche aux nécessités du moment. Napoléon eut
beau chercher à présenter son divorce comme un devoir qu'il
remplissait uniquement pour assurer la stabilité de l'empire, personne
ne s'y trompa, et l'on vit bien que c'était une satisfaction de vanité
de plus, qu'il avait demandée à son mariage avec l'archiduchesse.

Les détails sur le conseil où l'empereur mit en délibération le choix
de la nouvelle impératrice ne sont pas sans un certain intérêt
historique; je veux leur donner place ici. Depuis longtemps Napoléon
faisait circuler à sa cour et dans le public que l'impératrice
Joséphine ne pouvait plus avoir d'enfants, et que Joseph Bonaparte,
son frère, qui n'avait ni gloire ni esprit, était incapable de lui
succéder. Cela se mandait au dehors, et du dehors cela revenait en
France. Fouché avait soin de faire répandre ces bruits par sa police;
le duc de Bassano endoctrinait dans le même sens les hommes de
lettres; Berthier se chargeait des militaires; on a vu qu'à l'entrevue
d'Erfurt, Napoléon lui-même avait voulu s'en ouvrir à l'empereur
Alexandre. Enfin tout était prêt, lorsqu'au mois de janvier 1810,
l'empereur convoqua un conseil extraordinaire, composé des grands
dignitaires, des ministres, du grand maître de l'instruction publique
et de deux ou trois autres grands personnages dans l'ordre civil. Le
nombre et la qualité des personnes qui faisaient partie de ce conseil,
le silence gardé sur l'objet de sa convocation, le silence encore
pendant quelques minutes dans la salle même de la réunion, tout
annonçait l'importance de ce qui allait se passer.

L'empereur, avec un certain embarras et une émotion qui me parut
sincère, parla à peu près en ces termes: «Je n'ai pas renoncé sans
regret, assurément, à l'union qui répandait tant de douceur sur ma vie
intérieure. Si, pour satisfaire aux espérances que l'empire attache
aux nouveaux liens que je dois contracter, je pouvais ne consulter que
mon sentiment personnel, c'est au milieu des jeunes élèves de la
Légion d'honneur, parmi les filles des braves de la France, que
j'irais choisir une compagne, et je donnerais pour impératrice aux
Français celle que ses qualités et ses vertus rendraient la plus
digne du trône. Mais il faut céder aux moeurs de son siècle, aux usages
des autres États, et surtout aux convenances dont la politique a fait
des devoirs. Des souverains ont désiré l'alliance de mes proches, et
je crois qu'il n'en est maintenant aucun à qui je ne puisse offrir
avec confiance mon alliance personnelle. Trois familles régnantes
pourraient donner une impératrice à la France: celles d'Autriche, de
Russie et de Saxe. Je vous ai réunis pour examiner avec vous quelle
est celle de ces trois alliances à laquelle, dans l'intérêt de
l'empire, la préférence peut être due.»

Ce discours fut suivi d'un long silence que l'empereur rompit par ces
mots: «Monsieur l'archichancelier, quelle est votre opinion?»

Cambacérès, qui me parut avoir préparé ce qu'il allait dire, avait
retrouvé dans ses souvenirs de membre du comité de Salut public, que
l'Autriche était et serait toujours notre ennemie. Après avoir
longuement développé cette idée qu'il appuya sur beaucoup de faits et
de précédents, il finit par exprimer le voeu que l'empereur épousât une
grande duchesse de Russie.

Lebrun[5], mettant de côté la politique, employa bourgeoisement tous
les motifs tirés des moeurs, de l'éducation et de la simplicité pour
donner la préférence à la cour de Saxe, et vota pour cette
alliance.--Murat et Fouché crurent les intérêts révolutionnaires plus
en sûreté par une alliance russe; il paraît que tous deux se
trouvaient plus à leur aise avec les descendants des czars qu'avec
ceux de Rodolphe de Habsbourg.

  [5] Charles Lebrun, né en 1739, fut en 1768 payeur des rentes et
  inspecteur général du domaine royal; il était l'ami et le
  collaborateur dévoué du chancelier Maupeou. Il fut destitué en 1774.
  Député du tiers aux états généraux, puis administrateur du département
  de Seine-et-Oise, il fut arrêté en 1794 et ne fut relâché qu'après le
  9 thermidor. Il fut nommé député au conseil des Anciens en 1796. Après
  le 18 brumaire il devint troisième consul, architrésorier en 1804,
  prince et duc de Plaisance en 1808, lieutenant de l'empereur en
  Hollande en 1810. En 1814, il fut nommé commissaire royal à Caen et
  pair de France. Sous les Cent-jours, il accepta également la pairie
  impériale et les fonctions de grand maître de l'Université. Il mourut
  en 1824.

Mon tour vint; j'étais là sur mon terrain; je m'en tirai passablement
bien. Je pus soutenir par d'excellentes raisons qu'une alliance
autrichienne serait préférable pour la France. Mon motif secret était
que la conservation de l'Autriche dépendait du parti que l'empereur
allait prendre. Mais ce n'était pas là ce qu'il fallait dire. Après
avoir brièvement exposé les avantages et les inconvénients d'un
mariage russe et d'un mariage autrichien, je me prononçai pour ce
dernier. Je m'adressai à l'empereur, et comme Français, en lui
demandant qu'une princesse autrichienne apparût au milieu de nous pour
absoudre la France aux yeux de l'Europe et à ses propres yeux d'un
crime qui n'était pas le sien et qui appartenait tout entier à une
faction. Le mot de réconciliation européenne que j'employai plusieurs
fois, plaisait à plusieurs membres du conseil, qui en avaient assez de
la guerre. Malgré quelques objections que me fit l'empereur, je vis
bien que mon avis lui convenait. M. Mollien[6] parla après moi, et
soutint la même opinion avec l'esprit juste et fin qui le distinguait.

  [6] Le comte Mollien, né à Rouen en 1758, était premier commis au
  contrôle général en 1789. Il fut arrêté en 1794 comme complice des
  fermiers généraux, mais fut sauvé par le 9 thermidor. Au 18
  brumaire; il devint directeur de la caisse d'amortissement,
  conseiller d'État en 1804, ministre du trésor en 1806; il resta à
  ce poste jusqu'en 1814, et y revint durant les Cent-jours. Il fut
  nommé pair de France en 1819. Il mourut en 1850.

L'empereur, après avoir entendu tout le monde, remercia le conseil,
dit que la séance était levée et se retira. Le soir même il envoya un
courrier à Vienne, et au bout de peu de jours, l'ambassadeur de France
manda que l'empereur François accordait la main de sa fille,
l'archiduchesse Marie-Louise, à l'empereur Napoléon.

Pour rattacher à cette union la gloire d'une conquête faite par son
armée, Napoléon envoya le _prince de Wagram_ (Berthier) épouser
l'archiduchesse par procuration, et donna à la maréchale Lannes,
duchesse de Montebello (son mari avait été tué à Wagram[7]) la place
de dame d'honneur. Comme il ne faut rien omettre des bizarreries de
cette époque, je dois faire remarquer qu'au moment où le canon
annonçait à Paris les fiançailles faites à Vienne, les lettres de
l'ambassadeur de France apprenaient que le dernier traité avec
l'Autriche était fidèlement exécuté, et que le canon faisait sauter
les fortifications de la ville de Vienne. Cette observation montre
avec quelle rigoureuse exigence l'empereur Napoléon traitait son
nouveau beau-père, et prouve bien que la paix n'était alors pour lui
qu'une trêve employée à préparer de nouvelles conquêtes. Aussi tous
les peuples étaient en souffrance; tous les souverains restaient
inquiets et troublés. Partout Napoléon faisait naître des haines et
inventait des difficultés, qui, à la longue, devaient devenir
insurmontables. Et comme si l'Europe ne lui en fournissait pas assez,
il s'en créait de nouvelles, en autorisant les ambitions de sa propre
famille. La funeste parole qu'il avait proférée un jour, qu'avant sa
mort, sa dynastie serait la plus ancienne de l'Europe, lui faisait
distribuer à ses frères et aux époux de ses soeurs les trônes et les
principautés que la victoire et la perfidie mettaient dans ses mains.
C'est ainsi qu'il disposa de Naples, de la Westphalie, de la Hollande,
de l'Espagne, de Lucques, de la Suède même, puisque c'était le désir
de lui plaire qui avait fait élire Bernadotte prince royal de Suède.

  [7] Le maréchal Linnes fut tué à Essling, et non à Wagram.

Une vanité puérile le poussa dans cette voie qui offrait tant de
dangers. Car, ou ces souverains de nouvelle création restaient dans sa
grande politique et en devenaient les satellites, et, alors, il leur
était impossible de prendre racine dans le pays qui leur était confié;
ou ils devaient leur échapper plus vite que Philippe V n'avait échappé
à Louis XIV. La divergence inévitable de peuple à peuple altère
bientôt les liens de famille des souverains. Aussi, chacune de ces
nouvelles créations devint-elle un principe de dissolution dans la
fortune de Napoléon. On le retrouve partout dans les dernières années
de son règne. Quand Napoléon donnait une couronne, il voulait que le
nouveau roi restât lié au système de cette domination universelle, de
ce _grand empire_ dont j'ai déjà parlé. Celui, au contraire, qui
montait sur le trône, n'avait pas plutôt saisi l'autorité, qu'il la
voulait sans partage et qu'il résistait avec plus ou moins d'audace à
la main qui cherchait à l'assujettir. Chacun de ces princes improvisés
se croyait placé au niveau des plus anciens souverains de l'Europe,
par le seul fait d'un décret et d'une entrée solennelle dans sa
capitale occupée par un corps d'armée français. Le respect humain qui
lui commandait de se montrer indépendant en faisait un obstacle plus
dangereux aux projets de Napoléon que ne l'aurait été un ennemi
naturel. Suivons-les un instant dans leur carrière royale.

Le royaume de Naples, par lequel je commencerai, avait été conféré, ce
sont les termes d'alors, le 30 mars 1806, à Joseph Bonaparte l'aîné
des frères de l'empereur. On voulut donner à son entrée dans ce
royaume l'air d'une conquête, mais le fait est qu'il dut lire avec un
peu d'étonnement dans le _Moniteur_ le récit de la soi-disant
résistance qu'il avait éprouvée.

Au bout de quatre mois, le nouveau roi était déjà en querelle avec son
frère. Joseph ne résida que peu de temps à Naples; les circonstances
le conduisirent bientôt en Espagne. Le pouvoir, pendant son séjour à
Naples, n'avait été pour lui qu'un moyen d'amusement; et, comme s'il
eût été le quinzième de sa race, il regardait comment ses ministres se
tireraient, suivant l'expression de Louis XV, des embarras journaliers
du gouvernement. Sur le trône, il ne cherchait que les douceurs de la
vie privée et les facilités d'un libertinage que de grands noms
rendaient brillant.

A Joseph succéda Murat, que son grand-duché de Berg ne contentait
plus. Celui-ci n'eut pas plus tôt mis le pied au delà des Alpes que
son imagination lui présenta déjà l'Italie entière comme devant être à
lui, un jour. Par le traité qui lui assurait la couronne de Naples, il
s'était engagé à maintenir la constitution donnée par son prédécesseur
Joseph. Mais comme cette constitution n'était encore exécutée que dans
sa partie administrative, il laissa de côté le changement des lois
civiles et criminelles qu'il avait promis de faire, et il ne se montra
pressé que de terminer l'organisation financière du pays. Pour
faciliter les recettes, et accroître les revenus, il commença par
abolir tous les droits féodaux. Excité par son ministre Zurlo[8], il
voulut que cette opération, qu'il n'envisageait que du côté fiscal,
fût immédiatement consommée. Et la commission instituée à cet effet
prononça sur tous les litiges existant entre les seigneurs et les
communes, de manière à favoriser les seules communes; et cela se
faisait dans le temps même où Napoléon cherchait à refaire en France
de l'aristocratie et à créer des majorats. Le résultat de cette
opération fut non seulement de dépouiller les barons napolitains de
tous les droits féodaux et de toutes les prestations dont ils
jouissaient, mais encore de leur enlever, au profit des communes, la
plus grande partie des terres, qui se trouvaient indivises depuis
plusieurs siècles.

  [8] Giuseppe, comte Zurlo, né en 1759 à Naples, fut nommé directeur
  des finances en 1798. En 1806, il suivit le roi Ferdinand à
  Palerme, mais se rallia en 1809 à Murat, devint conseiller d'État,
  ministre de la justice et des cultes, et ministre de l'intérieur.
  En 1815 il se réfugia à Rome, revint à Naples en 1820, fut nommé
  ministre de l'intérieur, mais dut se retirer la même année. Il
  mourut en 1828.

Cette mesure porta un préjudice notable à la fortune des nobles, mais
elle rendit plus facile l'assiette de l'impôt, et celui-ci, plus
productif. Aussi, dans l'espace de cinq années, le gouvernement
napolitain porta-t-il les revenus publics de quarante-quatre millions
de francs à plus de quatre-vingts. Des améliorations réelles dans
l'administration, qui furent la suite de la prospérité du trésor,
dirigé par les mains habiles de M. Agar, créé depuis comte de
Mosbourg[9], apaisèrent les premiers mécontentements du pays et les
empêchèrent d'arriver jusqu'à Napoléon, qui, du reste, était disposé à
l'indulgence pour Murat. Il voyait encore tant d'argile en lui, qu'il
était flatté de ce qu'il lui rappelait à chaque moment une de ses
créations. Il lui passa mille choses inconvenantes et quelques-unes
même assez graves avant de lui faire des reproches. Il fallut bien
cependant éclater lorsque Murat ordonna que les Français, qui, avec
l'autorisation de l'empereur, se trouvaient au service de Naples, lui
prêtassent serment de fidélité et se fissent naturaliser dans le pays.
Tous furent indignés de cette exigence; et Napoléon, poussé à bout,
manifesta son mécontentement avec sa violence accoutumée. Il ordonna
de réunir dans un camp, à douze lieues de Naples, les troupes
françaises qui se trouvaient dans le royaume; et, de ce camp, il fit
déclarer que tout citoyen français était de droit citoyen du royaume
de Naples, parce que, aux termes de son institution, ce royaume
faisait partie du _grand empire_.

  [9] Michel Agar, comte de Mosbourg, né en 1771 près de Cahors, fut
  d'abord avocat, puis professeur dans cette ville. En 1804 il entra
  au Corps législatif, devint en 1806 ministre des finances de Murat,
  son compatriote, qui venait d'être nommé grand-duc de Berg, et
  l'accompagna en la même qualité à Naples. Il vécut dans la retraite
  sous la Restauration, fut nommé député du Lot en 1830, et pair de
  France en 1837. Il mourut en 1844.

Murat, qui, dans un moment de fougue, s'était laissé entraîner à une
démarche aussi imprudente, se persuada que jamais l'empereur ne la lui
pardonnerait et qu'il n'avait d'autre parti à prendre que de chercher
sa sûreté dans un accroissement de puissance; dès lors, il ne s'occupa
plus que des moyens d'envahir toute l'Italie. La réunion à l'empire
français de la Toscane, de Rome, de la Hollande, des villes
hanséatiques, avait déjà jeté beaucoup d'inquiétude dans son esprit.
L'emploi, non défini, de ce mot de _grand empire_, qu'il venait
d'entendre au milieu de ses États, le troubla complètement, et il
commença à dévoiler ses vues ultérieures.

La reine, qui partageait jusqu'à un certain point les craintes de
Murat, n'était cependant pas du même avis que lui sur la manière
d'échapper aux projets que pouvait avoir son frère. Elle croyait que
c'était un mauvais moyen pour conserver une domination aussi peu
affermie, que de chercher à l'étendre.

L'arrivée du maréchal Pérignon[10] à Naples, pour y prendre le
gouvernement de la ville, légitima aux yeux de Murat les extrémités
auxquelles il pourrait se porter. Et bientôt, les événements de
l'Europe, en ranimant ses espérances d'ambition et de vengeance,
donnèrent plus d'activité à ses combinaisons. Dans sa double pensée
d'échapper à l'influence française et d'étendre sa domination en
Italie, il ne s'occupa que d'augmenter son armée et de chercher à
entamer quelques négociations avec l'Autriche, qui était elle-même
effrayée de plus en plus de la politique envahissante du gouvernement
français. La reine se chargea d'écrire à M. de Metternich, sur lequel
elle croyait avoir conservé de l'influence et dont elle avait éprouvé
la discrétion. Le roi, d'un autre côté, conduisait secrètement une
négociation avec les autorités anglaises et particulièrement avec lord
William Bentinck[11] qui se trouvait en Sicile. Les intérêts du
commerce en avaient été le prétexte et la base. Murat, se croyant
autorisé à se plaindre de Napoléon et à rejeter sur lui l'odieux des
prohibitions, indiquait sa disposition à se séparer de lui. Mais le
temps de la rupture n'était pas encore arrivé. La campagne de Russie
venait de s'ouvrir et Murat ne pouvait pas refuser de s'y rendre avec
son contingent, sur le chiffre duquel, comme les autres alliés de
l'empereur, il se borna à discuter. La reine demeura chargée du
gouvernement. Un mélange de raison, de finesse et de galanterie lui
donnait plus d'influence et de pouvoir que n'en avait jamais eu son
mari. Pendant que Murat se battait, et servait de sa personne la cause
française, toute sa politique était donc dirigée dans un sens
contraire. Ce double rôle lui plaisait assez: d'une part, il
remplissait ses devoirs envers la France et l'empereur; et, de
l'autre, il croyait agir en roi, en prince indépendant appelé aux plus
hautes destinées.

  [10] Dominique, comte, puis marquis Pérignon, était officier sous
  l'ancien régime. Député à l'Assemblée législative, puis commandant
  d'une légion à l'armée des Pyrénées, il succéda à Dugommier dans le
  commandement en chef. Membre du conseil des Cinq-cents en 1793,
  ambassadeur à Madrid en 1796, il fut ensuite placé à la tête d'un
  corps de l'armée d'Italie, mais fut blessé et pris à Novi. Il entra
  au Sénat en 1801, fut nommé maréchal de France en 1804, gouverneur
  de Parme et de Plaisance, et enfin commandant en chef des armées du
  royaume de Naples. Il fut créé pair de France en 1814 et mourut en
  1818.

  [11] Lord William Cavendish Bentinck (1774-1839), fils du duc de
  Portland, entra à l'armée, devint gouverneur de Madras en 1803 et
  général major en 1808. En cette qualité il fit les campagnes de
  Portugal et d'Espagne. En 1811, il fut nomma commandant en chef des
  troupes anglaises en Sicile. En 1827, Bentinck fut nommé gouverneur
  du Bengale, puis gouverneur général de l'Inde. Il fut rappelé en
  1835.

Quand l'Autriche se déclara contre la France, et que la bataille de
Leipzig eut marqué le terme de la fortune de Napoléon, Murat accourut
à Naples, et depuis ce moment il mit tout en jeu pour rendre sa
défection utile au maintien de sa couronne, et pour entrer dans la
grande ligue européenne. Il y trouva beaucoup de facilité. Le désir
qu'avaient les puissances coalisées d'isoler complètement Napoléon, et
le refus qu'avait fait Eugène de Beauharnais d'entrer dans cette
combinaison, rendaient la défection de Murat très utile pour les
puissances coalisées.

Napoléon, instruit de tout ce qui se passait, ne fut éclairé dans
cette circonstance ni par son génie ni par ses conseillers. Il aurait
dû, dans son intérêt, rappeler Eugène de Beauharnais sur Lyon, avec
tout ce qui lui restait de troupes françaises, et abandonner l'Italie
aux rêves ambitieux de Murat. C'était le seul moyen qui restât pour
empêcher sa jonction avec les puissances coalisées, et pour provoquer
en Italie un mouvement national qui, dans cette campagne, aurait été
d'une grande importance pour Napoléon. Mais les yeux de celui-ci
étaient fascinés, et la trahison était consommée au moment même où il
croyait utile de parler encore de la fidélité de celui qui, depuis
plusieurs mois déjà, avait signé son traité avec l'Autriche. Les
intrigues de Murat pour arriver à la domination générale de l'Italie
n'en continuèrent pas moins; on put en suivre assez exactement la
trace, pour qu'elles devinssent au congrès de Vienne un motif de
rupture avec lui, de la part de toutes les puissances. Sa ruine en a
été la suite.

J'ai voulu ici faire ressortir cette vérité, qu'il y avait dans la
puissance de Napoléon, au point où elle était parvenue, et dans ses
créations politiques, un vice radical, qui me paraissait devoir nuire
à son affermissement et même préparer sa chute. Napoléon se plaisait à
inquiéter, à humilier, à tourmenter ceux qu'il avait élevés; eux,
placés dans un état perpétuel de méfiance et d'irritation,
travaillaient sourdement à nuire au pouvoir qui les avait créés et
qu'ils regardaient déjà comme leur principal ennemi.

Sous une forme ou sous une autre, le même principe de destruction dont
je viens avec détails de montrer l'existence à Naples, se retrouve
dans tous les établissements du même genre que Napoléon voulut faire.

En Hollande, il avait commencé par faire passer le pouvoir, qui était
entre les mains, d'un directoire amovible, dans celles d'un
président. Il avait déterminé M. Schimmelpenninck[12] à accepter le
pouvoir souverain sous le titre de grand pensionnaire. M.
Schimmelpenninck était trop homme d'esprit pour se dissimuler que le
rôle qu'on l'appelait à jouer ne devait être que temporaire. Mais les
exigences des agents français, et les dilapidations de tout genre qui
en étaient la suite, irritant naturellement l'opinion publique en
Hollande, M. Schimmelpenninck avait espéré se servir utilement pour
son pays du crédit momentané qui devait être le prix de sa déférence
pour Napoléon, et obtenir par là de meilleures conditions pour la
Hollande. Son illusion à cet égard ne put pas être de longue durée.
L'empereur, qui voulait toujours donner les apparences d'un mouvement
national aux crises qu'il faisait naître dans le but d'anéantir
l'indépendance des pays conquis, provoqua sourdement, dès l'avènement
de M. Schimmelpenninck, les murmures des anciens ordres privilégiés,
de la magistrature des villes et de la noblesse de la Hollande contre
un individu sorti de la classe bourgeoise, et chercha en même temps à
ranimer l'esprit révolutionnaire du peuple, pour le porter à se
soulever contre le pouvoir que le nouvel ordre de choses accordait à
un seul homme. Mais la modération, la sagesse du grand pensionnaire,
le profond bon sens des Hollandais, et la conviction que toute
tentative de mouvement amènerait immédiatement l'intervention
péremptoire de la France, déterminèrent la nation à se soumettre
tranquillement à son nouveau gouvernement.

  [12] Roger Jean, comte Schimmelpenninck, né en 1761, homme d'État
  hollandais, fut mêlé aux mouvements révolutionnaires qui agitèrent
  la Hollande en 1795. Il fut nommé ambassadeur à Paris en 1798, puis
  à Londres en 1802. En 1805, la constitution hollandaise ayant été
  transformée à l'instigation de Napoléon, il dut accepter la charge
  de grand pensionnaire.--Sous le règne de Louis Bonaparte,
  Schimmelpenninck vécut dans la retraite. Après la réunion de la
  Hollande à la France, il fut nommé sénateur. Il donna sa démission
  en 1814, et, redevenu Hollandais, il devint membre de la première
  chambre des États-généraux. Il mourut en 1825.

L'empereur, qui vit que ses menées n'aboutissaient point au but qu'il
s'était proposé et qu'il n'avait point d'action sur le pays, suivit
une autre marche. Il fit savoir principalement par l'entremise de
l'amiral Verhuell[13], à M. Schimmelpenninck lui-même, et à quelques
personnes marquantes du pays, que cet état de choses ne pouvait pas
durer, et qu'il était indispensable pour la Hollande de former avec la
France une union plus intime, en demandant pour souverain un prince
français. Quelques explications prouvèrent jusqu'à l'évidence à
Napoléon que la réunion à la France était ce que le pays redoutait le
plus, et il se servit habilement de cette disposition pour faire
presque désirer un de ses frères. Non seulement il promettait de
conserver l'intégralité du territoire, mais il y ajoutait l'Ost-Frise,
et donnait aux familles notables des espérances de tout genre. M.
Schimmelpenninck était dans l'irrésolution la plus pénible; il n'osait
ni consulter la nation, ni consentir à ce que l'on exigeait. Le parti
de nommer une députation pour se rendre à Paris et y juger sur les
lieux jusqu'où pouvait aller la résistance lui parut être ce qu'il y
avait de plus prudent et de plus sage à faire. Il composa cette
députation de MM. Goldberg, Gogel[14], Six et Van Styrum. Leurs
instructions, comme celles de l'amiral Verhuell, portaient de ne
consentir sous aucun prétexte à la réunion, et de se défendre contre
toute proposition d'un établissement monarchique, en soutenant que les
formes en étaient opposées aux moeurs et aux habitudes du pays.

  [13] Charles-Henri Verhuell, comte de Sevenaar, né en 1764, entra
  dans la marine en 1779. Contre-amiral en 1803, il commanda la
  flotte destinée à agir contre l'Angleterre, et fut nommé ministre
  de la marine de Hollande. En 1806, il présida la commission chargée
  d'offrir la couronne de Hollande à Louis Bonaparte. Il devint
  maréchal et ambassadeur à Paris en 1807. En 1811, après la réunion
  de la Hollande à la France, il entra au Corps législatif; il
  commanda les armées du Texel et du Helder en 1813, et resta fidèle
  à l'empereur jusqu'à la dernière extrémité. Naturalisé Français en
  1814, il fut créé pair de France en 1819, et mourut en 1845.

  [14] Alexandre Gogel, né en 1765, industriel et homme d'État
  hollandais. Il fut ministre des finances de la république batave.
  Il fut également ministre du roi Louis, et devint membre du conseil
  d'État de France, après la réunion de la Hollande à l'empire. Il
  mourut en 1821.

L'empereur savait tout cela aussi bien que les députés hollandais;
mais sa volonté était si positive, sa vanité était si engagée,
qu'aucune considération, de quelque genre qu'elle fût, ne put empêcher
ces malheureux négociateurs d'être amenés à demander formellement que
Louis Bonaparte voulût bien accepter la couronne de Hollande. Louis de
son côté fut contraint de la recevoir; c'est ainsi qu'on érigea la
Hollande en royaume. D'un tel ordre de choses, il ne devait sortir que
des difficultés pour Napoléon. Aussi arrivèrent-elles bientôt, et en
foule.

Le prince Louis, en arrivant à La Haye, reçut un accueil très froid.
Il n'y resta d'abord que très peu de temps; appelé par la déclaration
de guerre contre la Prusse à marcher à la tête de l'armée hollandaise
en Westphalie, il commençait le siège de Hameln, quand cette
forteresse se trouva comprise dans la capitulation de Magdebourg; sa
campagne finit là. Revenu à Amsterdam, il travailla à donner à la
Hollande une existence indépendante; de là, des discussions
interminables entre les deux frères. Un traité très dur pour la
Hollande en fut la suite. L'empereur le fit rédiger de manière à
choquer assez son frère pour qu'il dût se déterminer à abdiquer. Mais
l'irritation de Louis Bonaparte le porta à des extrémités d'un tout
autre genre. Il se soumit en apparence, signa ce que l'on voulut, et
entama immédiatement des négociations avec les cours de
Saint-Pétersbourg et de Londres. Ses démarches auprès de ces deux
cours n'eurent aucun succès. Alors, décidé qu'il était à ne pas
exécuter le traité qu'il avait signé avec son frère, il se prépara à
une résistance ouverte: il excita toute la Hollande à la guerre, fit
élever des fortifications contre la France, et ne voulut pas céder,
même à la force, que Napoléon fut obligé d'employer contre lui.
Lorsqu'il vit son royaume envahi par l'armée que commandait le
maréchal Oudinot, il quitta furtivement le pays, et se retira dans je
ne sais quel coin de l'Allemagne, léguant à la Hollande toute la haine
qu'il avait contre son frère[15].

  [15] Napoléon n'avait placé son frère sur le trône de Hollande que
  pour maintenir ce pays dans le système continental. Sa tâche était
  difficile, car les intérêts et les sympathies des Hollandais les
  rapprochaient de l'Angleterre au lieu que la politique de Napoléon
  les ruinait. Le roi Louis ne voulut, ou ne put pas défendre dans
  son royaume les volontés de l'empereur, et laissa la contrebande
  anglaise s'organiser sur ses côtes. Napoléon se plaignit vivement,
  et ne négligea rien pour contraindre son frère à entrer dans ses
  vues. Par le traité du 11 novembre 1807, il lui enleva Flessingue,
  un des ports les plus importants de la Hollande, contre quelques
  agrandissements sans conséquence. La situation restant toujours la
  même, il alla plus loin, et annonça au Corps législatif que les
  exigences de sa politique pourraient le forcer à annexer la
  Hollande (discours du 3 déc. 1809). Toutefois, ce moyen extrême lui
  répugnait; il tenta de l'éviter en signant avec le roi Louis un
  second traité (16 mars 1810) par lequel celui-ci lui cédait la
  Zélande et le Brabant hollandais; en même temps, il était stipulé
  que les côtes de Hollande seraient gardées par les douaniers
  français assistés d'un corps de troupe. Louis vint à Paris signer
  ce traité, mais, rentré dans ses États, il évita de l'appliquer.
  Napoléon fit aussitôt entrer vingt mille hommes en Hollande. Le roi
  eut un instant la pensée de résister, mais personne n'ayant voulu
  le suivre, il abdiqua et se réfugia, à l'étranger. La Hollande fut
  réunie à l'empire par un décret en date du 1er juillet 1810.

La réunion de ce pays à la France fut la suite de son départ.
L'empereur agrandit par là son empire, mais diminua ses forces; car il
devait employer constamment un corps d'armée pour s'assurer de la
fidélité de ses nouveaux sujets. Ceux-ci craignaient beaucoup plus les
levées rigoureuses de la conscription et des gardes d'honneur, qu'ils
n'étaient flattés de voir le fort du Helder devenir un des boulevards
maritimes de l'empire français, et le Zuydersée fournir une grande
école de navigation, où devaient être exercés les équipages des
flottes que la France faisait construire à Anvers. Les différents
gouvernements par lesquels Napoléon fit passer la Hollande y
détruisirent complètement la confiance du peuple, et firent détester
le nom français; mais les plus grandes difficultés qu'il eut à
éprouver dans ce pays surgirent, on vient de le voir, là, comme dans
d'autres de ses créations, de sa propre famille.

L'agrégation d'une vingtaine de petits États, érigés par un décret en
royaume de Westphalie, en faveur de Jérôme Bonaparte son frère,
apporta à son ambition de nouveaux embarras. Ce royaume, dont la
population était d'environ deux millions d'habitants, comprenait en
entier les États de l'électeur de Hesse-Cassel. Il faut se souvenir
que dans ce pays de Hesse, la volonté du souverain remplaçait à peu de
choses près toutes les institutions, et que le peuple, qui n'était
point surchargé d'impôts, ne cherchait pas encore d'autre manière
d'être gouverné.

Jérôme, peu de temps après sa nomination (c'était le terme dont
l'empereur voulait qu'on se servît), se rendit à Cassel, capitale de
ses États. Son frère lui avait donné une espèce de régence, composée
de M. Beugnot[16], homme de beaucoup d'esprit, et de MM. Siméon[17]
et Jolivet[18] dont il devait suivre les directions. Leurs
portefeuilles étaient pleins de décrets organiques de tout genre. Ils
avaient d'abord apporté de Paris avec eux une constitution; ensuite,
ils devaient y adapter un système judiciaire, un système militaire et
un système de finances. Leur première opération fut de partager le
territoire et de changer ainsi en un moment, sans l'aide de l'esprit
révolutionnaire, toutes les traditions, toutes les habitudes et tous
les rapports que le temps avait établis. On créa ensuite des
préfectures, des sous-préfectures et on mit des maires partout. On
transporta ainsi en Allemagne tous les rouages de l'organisation
française et on prétendit leur avoir donné le mouvement. La tâche de
MM. les conseillers finie, M. Beugnot et M. Jolivet revinrent en
France. Jérôme Bonaparte s'empressa de leur faciliter les moyens de
s'y rendre. Il garda M. Siméon comme son ministre de la justice, et
alors il régna seul, c'est-à-dire qu'il eut une cour et un budget, ou
plutôt des femmes et de l'argent.

  [16] Jacques Claude, comte Beugnot, né en 1761, avocat au parlement
  de Paris en 1782, procureur syndic du département de l'Aube en
  1790, député à l'Assemblée législative en 1791. Il fut arrêté en
  1793, mais fut délivré au 9 thermidor. Après le 18 brumaire, il fut
  nommé préfet de la Seine-Inférieure, puis conseiller d'État en
  1806. En 1807, il fut un des administrateurs du royaume de
  Westphalie, puis, en 1808, commissaire impérial et ministre des
  finances du grand-duché de Berg. En 1814, il fut nommé par le
  gouvernement provisoire commissaire pour l'intérieur, puis
  directeur général de la police. Il passa de là à la marine. La
  seconde restauration le fit directeur général des postes, ministre
  d'État, et membre du conseil privé. Il fut élu député de la Marne.
  Il mourut en 1835.

  [17] Joseph-Jérôme, comte Siméon, né à Aix en 1749, était
  professeur de droit dans cette ville en 1789. En 1792, il fut un
  des chefs du mouvement fédéraliste provoqué dans le Midi par les
  girondins. Il dut s'enfuir en 1793, revint en France en 1795, entra
  au conseil des Cinq-Cents, et en devint le président. Proscrit au
  18 fructidor, il fut détenu à l'île d'Oléron jusqu'au 18 brumaire.
  Il fut nommé membre du tribunat en 1800, conseiller d'État en 1804,
  ministre de l'intérieur et de la justice, et président du conseil
  d'État de Westphalie, ministre de Westphalie à Berlin, puis près la
  confédération du Rhin. En 1814 il devint préfet du Nord. Sous la
  seconde restauration, il fut conseiller d'État (1815), puis
  sous-secrétaire d'État au département de la justice, pair de
  France, ministre d'État et membre du conseil privé (1821). Il fut
  président de la Cour des comptes sous la monarchie de Juillet, et
  mourut en 1842.

  [18] Jean-Baptiste, comte Jolivet, né en 1754, était avocat à Melun
  en 1789. Administrateur du département de Seine-et-Marne, puis
  député à l'Assemblée législative, il siégea dans le parti
  constitutionnel, fut arrêté sous la Terreur, et ne recouvra la
  liberté qu'après le 9 thermidor. Il devint conservateur général des
  hypothèques en 1795, conseiller d'État après le 18 brumaire,
  liquidateur général de la dette des départements de la rive gauche
  du Rhin, et ministre des finances de Westphalie (1807). Il se
  retira en 1815 et mourut en 1818.

La cour se forma toute seule; mais le budget, élevé au point où les
réserves de Napoléon qui se composaient de la moitié des biens
allodiaux forçaient de le porter, fut, dès les premières années, très
difficile à établir. Cette dynastie commença par où les autres
finissent. On en était aux expédients dès la seconde année du règne.
On ne chercha pas les expédients dans les économies qui pouvaient être
faites, mais dans la création de nouveaux impôts. Il fallut, au lieu
de trente-sept millions de revenu qui eussent été suffisants pour
fournir aux dépenses nécessaires de l'État, en trouver plus de
cinquante. Pour cela, on eut recours au moyen qui mécontente le plus
les peuples: on fit un emprunt forcé, qui, selon le résultat ordinaire
de ce genre d'impôt, provoqua beaucoup d'exactions et ne se remplit
pas à moitié. De trente-sept millions, les besoins et les dépenses
finirent par s'élever à soixante. La cour de Cassel avait la
prétention de rivaliser d'éclat avec celle des Tuileries. Le jeune
souverain s'abandonnait tellement à tous ses penchants, que j'ai
entendu dire au grave et véridique M. Reinhard[19], alors ministre de
France à Cassel, qu'à l'exception de trois ou quatre femmes
respectables par leur âge, il n'en était presque aucune au palais sur
la fidélité de laquelle Sa Majesté n'eût acquis des droits, quelque
grande que fût la surveillance de la belle madame de Truchsess et
celle de madame de la Flèche, qui avait aussi à surveiller les entours
du jeune prince de Wurtemberg[20].

  [19] Charles-Frédéric, comte Reinhard, né en 1761, entra dans la
  diplomatie comme premier secrétaire à Londres en 1791. C'est là
  qu'il connut M. de Talleyrand. Il passa à Naples en 1793, puis
  devint, en 1794, chef de division au département des relations
  extérieures. En 1795, il fut nommé ministre plénipotentiaire près
  les villes hanséatiques, puis en Toscane (1798). En juillet 1799,
  il succéda à Talleyrand comme ministre des relations extérieures,
  puis fut nommé successivement ministre en Helvétie (1800), à Milan
  (1801), en Saxe (1802), en Moldavie (1805), en Westphalie
  (1805-1814). En 1815, il entra au conseil d'État, fut ensuite
  ministre près la confédération germanique (1815-1829). Le
  gouvernement de Juillet le nomma ministre à Dresde (1830) et pair
  de France (1832). Il mourut en 1837. M. de Talleyrand prononça son
  éloge à l'Académie des sciences morales et politiques.

  [20] Le prince royal de Wurtemberg, brouillé avec le roi, son père,
  s'était réfugié, à cette époque, auprès de son beau-frère Jérôme
  Bonaparte, marié à la princesse Catherine de Wurtemberg.

Le luxe de la cour, ses désordres et le malaise du pays, faisaient
détester la France et l'empereur à qui tout était attribué; et si ce
malaise ne produisit pas d'explosion immédiate, c'est que la
résignation naturelle aux Allemands était augmentée par la terreur que
causait l'alliance étroite du roi de Westphalie avec le colosse de la
puissance française. De quel oeil les graves universités de Göttingue
et de Halle, dont Jérôme était le souverain, pouvaient-elles voir ce
luxe effréné, ce désordre, si éloignés de la simplicité, de la décence
et du bon sens qui distinguaient cette partie de l'Allemagne? Aussi,
lorsqu'en 1813 les troupes russes entrèrent en Westphalie,
regarda-t-on ce moment comme celui de la délivrance. Et cependant, le
pays retombait sous la domination de cet électeur de Hesse qui, trente
ans auparavant, vendait ses soldats à l'Angleterre[21].

  [21] Guillaume IX, landgrave de Hesse-Cassel, électeur en 1803,
  dépossédé en 1806. Ses États lui furent rendus en 1814. Il mourut
  en 1821.

Le luxe de ces cours fondées par Napoléon, c'est ici l'occasion de le
remarquer, était absurde. Le luxe des Bonaparte n'était ni allemand ni
français; c'était un mélange, une espèce de luxe érudit: il était pris
partout. Il avait quelque chose de grave comme celui de l'Autriche,
quelque chose d'européen et d'asiatique, tiré de Pétersbourg. Il
étalait quelques manteaux pris à la Rome des Césars; mais, en
revanche, il montrait bien peu de chose de l'ancienne cour de France
où la parure dérobait si heureusement la magnificence sous le charme
de tous les arts du goût. Ce que ce genre de luxe faisait ressortir
surtout, c'était le manque absolu de convenance; et, en France, quand
les convenances manquent trop, la moquerie est bien près.

Cette famille des Bonaparte qui était sortie d'une île retirée, à
peine française, où elle vivait dans une situation mesquine, ayant
pour chef un homme de génie, dont l'élévation était due à une gloire
militaire acquise à la tête d'armées républicaines, sorties
elles-mêmes d'une démocratie en ébullition, n'aurait-elle pas dû
repousser l'ancien luxe, et adopter, même pour le côté frivole de la
vie, une route toute nouvelle? N'aurait-elle pas été plus imposante
par une noble simplicité qui aurait inspiré de la confiance dans sa
force et dans sa durée? Au lieu de cela, les Bonaparte s'abusèrent
assez pour croire qu'imiter puérilement les rois dont ils prenaient
les trônes était une manière de leur succéder.

Je veux éviter tout ce qui aurait une apparence libellique, et je n'ai
d'ailleurs pas besoin de citer des noms propres pour prouver que par
leurs moeurs aussi, ces nouvelles dynasties ont nui à la puissance
morale de l'empereur Napoléon. Les moeurs du peuple, dans les temps de
troubles, sont souvent mauvaises; mais, alors même que la foule a tous
les vices, sa morale est sévère. «Les hommes, dit Montesquieu,
corrompus en détail, sont très honnêtes gens en gros.» Et ce sont ces
honnêtes gens-là qui prononcent sur les rois et les reines. Quand ce
jugement est une flétrissure, il est bien difficile qu'une puissance,
surtout de nouvelle date, n'en soit pas ébranlée.

L'orgueil espagnol ne permit pas à ce grand et généreux peuple de
concentrer aussi longtemps sa haine que l'avait fait celui de
Westphalie. La perfidie de Napoléon la fit naître, et Joseph, depuis
son arrivée en Espagne, l'alimentait chaque jour. Il s'était persuadé
que dire du mal de son frère, c'était s'en séparer; et que se séparer
de son frère, c'était s'enraciner en Espagne. De là, une conduite et
un langage toujours en opposition formelle avec les volontés de
l'empereur. Il ne cessait pas de dire que Napoléon méprisait les
Espagnols. Il parlait de l'armée qui attaquait l'Espagne, comme du
rebut de l'armée française. Il racontait tout ce qui pouvait nuire le
plus à son frère. Il allait jusqu'à dévoiler les secrets honteux de sa
famille, et cela quelquefois en plein conseil. «Mon frère ne connaît
qu'un seul gouvernement, disait-il, et c'est un gouvernement de fer;
pour y arriver, tous les moyens lui sont bons;» et niaisement il
ajoutait: «Il n'y a que moi d'honnête homme dans ma famille, et si
les Espagnols voulaient se rallier autour de moi, ils apprendraient
bientôt à ne rien craindre de la France.» L'empereur, de son côté,
parlait avec la même inconvenance de Joseph; il l'accablait de mépris
et cela aussi devant les Espagnols, qui, entraînés par leur propre
exaspération, finirent par les croire tous deux quand ils parlaient
l'un de l'autre. L'irritation de Napoléon contre son frère le faisait
toujours agir de premier mouvement dans les affaires d'Espagne, et lui
faisait sans cesse commettre des fautes graves. Les deux frères se
contrariaient dans toutes leurs opérations; jamais il ne fut possible
de concerter entre eux aucun plan de conduite politique, aucun plan de
finances, aucune disposition militaire.

Il importait d'établir un commandement suprême; d'avoir une armée
d'occupation et une armée d'opérations, de convenir des moyens de
nourrir, d'habiller, de solder les troupes. Tout ce qui pouvait
conduire à ce résultat échouait successivement, ou par les ménagements
de Napoléon envers ses généraux auxquels il lui était connu de s'en
rapporter, et qui employaient sans cesse, et souvent dans leur propre
intérêt, ce prétexte banal: _la sûreté de l'armée que j'ai l'honneur
de commander exige telle ou telle chose_; ou bien, tout échouait par
la politique particulière de Joseph qui tendait constamment, par
opposition contre son frère, à faire retomber sur la France, toutes
les dépenses de la guerre. L'empereur, pour éviter les obstacles que
Joseph apportait incessamment à l'exécution de ses desseins, ordonna à
ses généraux de correspondre directement avec le prince de Neufchâtel,
son major général. Ils le firent tous, et sans s'être concertés,
uniquement éclairés par leur intérêt, dans presque toutes leurs
correspondances, ils engageaient l'empereur à renoncer au projet de
s'assurer de l'Espagne pour l'établissement d'un prince de sa famille,
et à chercher seulement à la morceler comme l'Italie et à y distribuer
des principautés, des duchés, des majorats, dont il ferait la
récompense _de ses braves_. On m'a dit que le duc d'Albuféra[22]
quelque peu bel esprit, ajoutait que ce serait en revenir au temps des
princes maures, vassaux du calife d'Occident.

  [22] Louis-Gabriel Suchet, né à Lyon en 1772, s'engagea en 1791,
  devint général en 1796, puis chef d'état-major de l'armée d'Italie
  en 1799. Il prit une part brillante aux grandes guerres de l'empire
  jusqu'en 1808, fut à cette date envoyé en Espagne, où sa belle
  conduite lui valut le bâton de maréchal, et ensuite le titre de duc
  d'Albuféra (1812). Il devint pair de France en 1814 et mourut en
  1826.

On savait semaine par semaine à Cadix, et, de là, dans tout le
royaume, ce qui se passait aux quartiers généraux français; et on peut
juger de l'intensité que la crainte d'un pareil avenir, donnait à la
résistance espagnole. Aussi, les généraux français avaient beau
vaincre, ils retrouvaient toujours de nouveaux ennemis devant eux, et
il n'y avait de véritablement soumis que les points couverts de
troupes françaises; et encore leurs communications étaient-elles
constamment coupées par les guérillas.

Joseph, de son côté, n'accordait de faveurs qu'à quelques Français
mécontents de l'empereur, qui avaient pris sa cocarde. Ces Castillans
nouveaux s'étaient glissés dans toutes les charges de cour, civiles et
militaires; ils avaient pénétré dans le conseil d'État; traitaient
avec une hauteur insupportable les Espagnols; flattaient la vanité du
roi de toutes les manières et ne manquaient jamais de dénigrer son
frère. La haine pour l'empereur se montrait autant au palais du roi
que dans la salle de la junte à Cadix.

Quel pouvait être le sort d'une entreprise où les chefs étaient en
opposition ouverte entre eux, et où les moyens étaient affaiblis par
le rappel successif de troupes déjà acclimatées, mais dont on avait
besoin, soit contre l'Autriche, soit contre la Russie, et qu'on
remplaçait par de malheureux conscrits?

L'empereur, ayant retrouvé à Wagram la fortune qui l'avait quelques
moments abandonné à Lobau, s'était persuadé que la soumission de
l'Espagne suivrait la paix qu'il avait dictée à Vienne; mais il n'en
fut rien. Cette paix n'exerça aucune influence sur les affaires de la
Péninsule; la résistance avait eu le temps de s'organiser, et elle
l'était partout. Napoléon crut alors qu'il fallait faire un grand
effort, et il le fit, mais à contresens. Il partait d'une idée fausse:
il croyait avoir bon marché des Espagnols, s'il chassait lord
Wellington du Portugal. Le maréchal Masséna employa d'immenses moyens
dans cette opération qui fut infructueuse et dont le succès aurait, en
tout cas, été à peu près nul pour le fond des affaires. C'était le
peuple espagnol en masse qui s'était soulevé, qui était armé, et qu'il
fallait dompter. Et en supposant même que l'empereur parvînt à
détruire la résistance armée, ne serait-il pas resté, pendant de
longues années, une résistance sourde, de toutes, la plus difficile à
détruire?

Joseph, que les autres entreprises de son frère laissèrent un peu plus
à lui-même et à ses propres moyens, reconnut enfin que c'était le
peuple qui était son véritable ennemi. Il fit alors tout pour le
gagner. Ses ministres répandaient des pamphlets remplis de promesses
de tout genre: c'était la liberté des Espagnols que voulait Joseph;
c'était une constitution adaptée aux moeurs du pays, dont il allait
soumettre le projet aux hommes les plus éclairés; c'était de grandes
économies qu'il annonçait, et une forte diminution dans les impôts.
Dans ses proclamations, tous les moyens révolutionnaires étaient mis
en mouvement. Les cortès de Cadix, pour en détruire l'effet, firent
immédiatement assaut de libéralisme avec Joseph, et allèrent sur tous
les points plus loin qu'il n'avait fait. On ne vit plus que décrets de
Cadix, supprimant l'inquisition, supprimant les droits féodaux, les
privilèges, les entraves de province à province, la censure des
journaux, etc... Et du milieu de ces ruines, on fit sortir une
constitution toute démocratique, dans laquelle cependant, pour ne pas
trop effrayer les amis de la monarchie, on avait placé un roi
héréditaire. Mais aucun roi n'aurait pu avec dignité, ni même avec
sûreté, occuper un pareil trône. Les cortès de Cadix auraient été
mieux avisées en rétablissant les lois fondamentales de l'Espagne, si
habilement minées et finalement détruites par les rois de la maison
d'Autriche.

Au travers de toutes ces menées, lord Wellington pénétrait en Espagne;
il enlevait Badajoz au duc de Dalmatie[23] et Ciudad-Rodrigo au duc de
Raguse[24]. Maître de ces deux clefs de l'Espagne aux extrémités nord
et sud de la frontière du Portugal, le général anglais trompa
habilement le duc de Dalmatie, en lui faisant croire qu'il voulait
déboucher en Andalousie, tandis qu'il se porta sur le Duero, vers
Valladolid. Le duc de Raguse, de son côté, sans attendre un renfort de
quinze mille hommes qui était à sa portée, laissa engager la bataille
des Arapiles[25], où, en arrivant sur le terrain, il reçut une
blessure grave. L'armée, sans chef, dès le premier coup de feu, fut
cruellement battue. Lord Wellington qui, à la suite de ses succès,
s'était d'abord trop avancé vers le nord, n'hésita pas, en homme
prudent, à adopter une marche rétrograde; il rentra en Portugal, d'où
le firent de nouveau sortir, en 1812, les désastres fameux de la
campagne de Russie, qui obligèrent l'empereur Napoléon à rappeler près
de lui les meilleures troupes qui restaient en Espagne.

La première nouvelle de ces désastres avait augmenté le désordre que
des chefs trop nombreux et peu soumis fomentaient autour de Joseph: la
perte de la fatale bataille de Vittoria[26] en fut la suite. Le duc de
Dalmatie, renvoyé à toute course en Espagne, chercha à réunir les
débris de l'armée. Il fit des marches savantes, mais ce n'était plus
que pour disputer à son habile adversaire les provinces méridionales
de la France. C'est ainsi que se termina cette grande conquête de
l'Espagne aussi mal conduite que perfidement conçue; et je dis mal
conduite, non seulement par les généraux de Napoléon, mais par
lui-même. Car lui aussi avait commis de graves fautes militaires en
Espagne. Si, à la fin de 1808, après la capitulation de Madrid, au
lieu de se lancer à la poursuite d'un corps anglais qui courait
s'embarquer à la Corogne, et auquel il ne fit que peu de mal, il avait
marché sur l'Andalousie et y avait frappé un grand coup, il aurait
désorganisé la résistance des généraux espagnols, qui n'auraient plus
eu que la ressource de se retirer en Portugal.

L'empereur, ayant une fois perdu de vue les vrais intérêts de la
France, s'était livré, avec l'irréflexion et l'ardeur de la passion, à
l'ambition de placer encore un membre de sa famille sur l'un des
premiers trônes de l'Europe, et, pour y parvenir, il attaqua l'Espagne
sans pudeur, et sans le moindre prétexte à faire valoir: c'est ce que
la probité des peuples ne pardonne jamais. Lorsqu'on étudie toutes les
actions ou plutôt tous les mouvements de Napoléon à cette époque si
importante de sa destinée, on arrive presque à croire qu'il était
entraîné par une sorte de fatalité qui aveuglait sa haute
intelligence.

Si l'empereur n'avait vu dans l'Espagne, qu'un terrain sur lequel il
pouvait forcer l'Angleterre à la paix, faire décider toutes les
grandes questions politiques pendantes alors en Europe, et assurer à
chaque souverain un état de possession solidement garanti, son
entreprise n'en serait pas plus justifiable; mais, du moins, elle
aurait été plus conforme à la politique hardie des conquérants. J'ai
rencontré quelques personnes qui ne le connaissaient pas, et dont
l'esprit, comme celui de nos vieux diplomates, étant porté à juger
théoriquement des événements, lui supposaient cette intention. Et, en
effet, les transactions de Bayonne étant révocables à volonté, on
pouvait les regarder comme un sacrifice bon à faire en temps utile, à
la pacification générale de l'Europe: mais, depuis le mois d'avril
1812, tous les faiseurs de combinaisons politiques ont été obligés
d'abandonner cette hypothèse; car, à cette époque, Napoléon refusa les
ouvertures du cabinet britannique, qui déclarait n'apercevoir aucune
difficulté insurmontable à s'arranger avec lui, sur tous les points en
litige, s'il admettait pour préalable le rétablissement de Ferdinand
VII sur le trône d'Espagne, et celui de Victor-Amédée sur le trône de
Sardaigne. S'il eût accepté ces propositions, il se serait aisément
fait alors un titre puissant de ses sacrifices, et tous les cabinets
auraient pu croire qu'il n'avait envahi l'Espagne que dans l'espoir de
faire jouir la France d'une paix durable, et d'affermir sa dynastie.

Mais, depuis longtemps, il ne s'agissait plus pour Napoléon de la
politique de la France, à peine de la sienne. Il ne songeait pas à
maintenir, il ne pensait qu'à s'étendre. Il semblait que l'idée de
conserver n'était jamais entrée dans son esprit et que son caractère
la repoussât.

Néanmoins, ce qu'il ne sut pas faire en temps utile, il fut forcé de
le faire lorsqu'il était trop tard, et sans aucun profit pour sa
puissance et pour sa gloire. Le renvoi des princes d'Espagne à Madrid
au mois de janvier 1814, et celui du pape à Rome à la même époque,
n'ont été que des expédients inspirés par la détresse; et la façon
subite, furtive même, dont ces mesures furent prises et exécutées,
leur ôta tout prestige de grandeur et de générosité. Mais je
m'aperçois que je parle du retour du pape dans ses États, sans que nos
affaires avec la cour de Rome aient trouvé leur place dans ce récit.
C'est cependant un événement trop remarquable de notre temps pour que
je ne doive pas en donner ici les détails.

Les contestations qui s'élevèrent entre Napoléon et la cour de Rome,
peu après le concordat de 1801, s'aigrirent encore après le sacre,
deux événements qui auraient dû les prévenir. Ces contestations ne
furent longtemps connues que par le bruit des violences de l'empereur
envers le pape et par les nobles plaintes du Saint-Père, qui ne
parvenaient que très difficilement et très confusément au public. Leur
origine et leurs causes auraient pu être mieux appréciées pour ce qui
concernait la partie purement théologique de ces discussions, lorsque
Napoléon convoqua à Paris un conseil ecclésiastique dont je parlerai
bientôt. Mais les opérations de ce conseil composé d'hommes fort
éclairés, avaient été tenues secrètes.

Par quelle suite d'événements le pape se trouva-t-il tourmenté et
persécuté pendant près de dix ans, si odieusement, si impolitiquement,
et de tant de manières?

Parcourons les faits avec leurs dates, en les reprenant d'un peu plus
loin. Plusieurs de ces dates expliqueront les grandes infortunes de
Pie VII, supportées avec un courage tellement héroïque, qu'on ose à
peine remarquer dans le Saint-Père, quelques légers torts
d'imprévoyance.

Pie VI, son prédécesseur, enlevé de Rome par ordre du directoire, le
10 février 1798, était mort à Valence le 29 août 1799. Pie VII fut élu
le 14 mars 1800 à Venise qui appartenait alors à l'empereur
d'Allemagne, d'après une des stipulations du traité de Campo-Formio;
et il fit, le 3 juillet de la même année, son entrée à Rome qui avait
été reconquise avec les États romains par les coalisés, pendant que
Bonaparte était en Égypte.

J'ai déjà dit quelque part que Bonaparte, de retour d'Égypte, était
arrivé subitement à Paris, le 16 octobre 1799, et que, par suite du
coup d'État du 18 brumaire (9 novembre 1799), il avait été placé à la
tête du gouvernement comme premier consul, le 13 décembre 1799.--Le
conclave s'était ouvert à Venise, le 1er de ce même mois de décembre,
et, pendant que Pie VII, élu au mois de mars suivant, allait de Venise
à Rome, Bonaparte venait de signaler sa prise de possession du pouvoir
par deux faits qui eurent la plus grande influence sur l'Italie. Le 2
juin 1800, il était entré à Milan où il avait rétabli la république
cisalpine, et douze jours après, le 14 juin, il avait gagné la fameuse
bataille de Marengo, qui rendit à la France une si grande partie de
l'Italie, et réduisit les États de l'Église à ce qu'ils avaient été
fixés par le traité de Tolentino.

Ainsi le pape, entrant à Rome après ces deux événements, le 3 juillet
1800, dut sentir combien il lui importait de se ménager un protecteur
aussi puissant et aussi redoutable que Bonaparte, et combien il
importait aussi à la religion dont il était le chef, et qui avait
éprouvé tant de vicissitudes et de persécutions en France, de faire
cesser le schisme qui déchirait depuis si longtemps ce malheureux
pays.

Bonaparte éprouva aussi ce même besoin, et, à son passage à Milan, il
entendit avec le plus grand intérêt les premières ouvertures qui lui
furent faites très secrètement et très habilement de la part de la
cour de Rome. N'est-ce pas une chose remarquable que, porté à la tête
du gouvernement par ses exploits militaires et par les idées
philosophiques ou libérales qui dominaient alors, Bonaparte ait senti
immédiatement la nécessité de se rapprocher de la cour de Rome? C'est
peut-être dans cette circonstance qu'il a donné la plus grande preuve
de la force de son caractère, car il sut braver alors toutes les
moqueries de l'armée et l'opposition même des deux consuls, ses
collègues. Il resta fermement attaché à l'idée, que, pour soutenir
soit la constitution civile du clergé, soit la théophilanthropie, qui
étaient également discréditées, il fallait accepter le rôle de
persécuteur de la religion catholique, et armer contre elle et contre
ses ministres la sévérité des lois; tandis qu'en abandonnant les
innovations religieuses de la Révolution, il lui était facile de se
faire de notre antique religion une amie, et même un appui dans
toutes les consciences catholiques de la France.

Il résolut donc, et c'est un des traits de son grand génie, de
s'entendre avec le chef de l'Église qui, seul, pouvait réconcilier,
ramener, prononcer comme juge ou comme arbitre, et rétablir enfin par
son autorité, à laquelle nulle autre n'était comparable, l'unité de
culte et de doctrine.

A cette autorité se joignait, dans la personne du pape, l'ascendant
d'une grande et sincère piété, de beaucoup de lumières et d'une
douceur attirante.

Le concordat ne pouvait paraître sous de plus heureux auspices; il
était fort désiré, dans les provinces surtout. Il fut converti en loi
le 8 avril 1802. Il se composait de dix-sept articles rédigés avec une
sagesse et une prévoyance remarquables. Tout y était clair, sans
équivoque; il n'y avait pas un mot qui pût choquer ou déplaire. Les
biens ecclésiastiques aliénés ne pouvaient plus être réclamés, et il
était déclaré que les acquéreurs de ces biens devaient être, à cet
égard, pleinement rassurés contre toute crainte. C'était un point
immense obtenu de la condescendance d'un pape rempli de piété.

Mais un point présentait de prodigieuses difficultés. Pour rétablir le
culte en France, il fallait obtenir de tous les anciens évêques leur
démission ou s'en passer. Ils les avaient tous offertes et même
remises à Pie VI, en 1791, lors de la constitution civile du clergé.
Pie VI avait cru devoir les refuser. Le pape Pie VII les leur demanda,
en 1801, par son bref du 24 août, _Tam multa,_ etc..., comme
préliminaire indispensable de toute négociation, leur déclarant,
toutefois, avec des expressions douces, confiantes, mais fermes, que
s'ils la refusaient, ce qu'il ne présumait pas, il se verrait avec
regret dans la nécessité de pourvoir par de nouveaux titulaires au
gouvernement des évêchés de la nouvelle circonscription.

Sur les quatre-vingt-un évêques qui vivaient encore et qui n'avaient
pas renoncé à l'épiscopat, quarante-cinq envoyèrent leur démission,
trente-six la refusèrent; le plus grand nombre, je pense, moins par
conviction théologique, quoiqu'ils fussent encouragés dans leur refus
par le savant théologien Asseline[27], que par attachement à la maison
de Bourbon et en haine du gouvernement de fait. On a prétendu que le
refus de plusieurs d'entre eux était plutôt dilatoire qu'absolu, mais
pourtant tous y persévérèrent, et leur résistance même sembla
s'accroître de jour en jour; car, après leurs réclamations canoniques
de 1803, signées par tous les évêques non démissionnaires[28], on vit
paraître, au mois d'avril 1804, avec une suite de réclamations plus
fortes encore, une _déclaration sur les droits du roi_[29], signée par
les treize évêques résidant en Angleterre. Et, enfin, anticipant sur
les événements, je dirai ici qu'en 1814, Louis XVIII, remontant sur le
trône, ces évêques prétendirent se faire, auprès du pape même, un
titre d'honneur de lui avoir résisté, et lui écrivirent, dans ce sens,
une lettre hautaine où chacun d'eux prenait le titre de son ancien
évêché. Le pape refusa de la recevoir, et il les amena, par la
persévérance de son refus, à lui adresser une lettre d'excuses, dans
laquelle ils abandonnèrent leurs prétentions et qu'ils ne signèrent
que comme _anciens_ évêques. Pour qu'il ne restât pas le moindre doute
à cet égard, le pape ne voulut pas qu'aucun d'eux fût replacé dans le
siège qu'il avait précédemment occupé, pas même M. l'archevêque de
Reims[30], malgré toute la convenance qu'il pouvait y avoir à faire
une exception en sa faveur.

  [27] Jean-René Asseline, né en 1742, entra dans les ordres et
  devint grand vicaire de M. de Beaumont, archevêque de Paris. En
  1790, il fut nommé évêque de Boulogne, refusa de prêter serment à
  la constitution civile et émigra en 1791. Il se retira à Munster
  d'où il protesta contre le concordat, en 1802. En 1807, il se
  rendit à l'appel de Louis XVIII, et vécut dans l'intimité de la
  famille royale jusqu'à sa mort (1813). Il a laissé de nombreux
  ouvrages de théologie.

  [28] C'est en 1801 que les évêques ayant refusé leur démission,
  réunis à Londres, avaient protesté contre le concordat, et avaient
  envoyé au pape un long mémoire où ils exposaient les motifs de leur
  refus. Ce mémoire a été publié à Londres en 1801. Il est signé de
  quatorze prélats: Arthur Dillon, archevêque de Narbonne; Louis de
  Conzié, évêque d'Arras; Joseph de Malide, évêque de Montpellier;
  Louis de Grimaldi, évêque-comte de Noyon, pair de France; Jean
  Lamarche, évêque de Léon; Pierre de Belbeuf, évêque d'Avranches;
  Sébastien Amelot, évêque de Vannes; Henry de Bethisy, évêque
  d'Uzès; Seignelai Colbert, évêque de Rodez; Charles de La
  Laurencie, évêque de Nantes; Philippe d'Albignac, évêque
  d'Angoulême; Alexandre de Chauvigny de Blot, évêque de Lombez;
  Emmanuel de Grossoles de Flammarens, évêque de Périgueux; Étienne
  de Galois de La Tour, évêque nommé de Moulins.

  [29] Le 15 avril 1804, M. de Dillon, archevêque de Narbonne,
  écrivit au pape pour protester de nouveau contre le concordat.
  Cette lettre était accompagnée d'une _déclaration sur les droits du
  roi_, signée des mêmes prélats que ci-dessus, sauf de l'évêque de
  Périgueux. Cette déclaration portait que la fidélité inviolable des
  peuples à leur souverain est commandée par l'Évangile; _que le
  prince est ministre de Dieu_; que tout rebelle envers son roi est
  coupable envers Dieu; _que le gouvernement actuel de la France, où
  le prince légitime n'a pas la part qui lui est due, s'il peut se
  faire qu'il allège un peu le poids des calamités sous lesquelles
  l'anarchie faisait gémir le peuple, ne satisfait ni à Dieu ni à
  César_..., il constitue une puissance de fait et non pas une
  puissance de droit; _il n'a que la possession ou plutôt
  l'usurpation_;--mais le prince légitime continue de conserver tous
  ses droits, bien qu'il soit forcé _d'en suspendre l'exécution_. En
  conséquence, les soussignés _pour remplir leur devoir d'évêques et
  de sujets, déclarent: 1º que notre très honoré seigneur et roi
  légitime Louis XVIII conserve, dans toute leur intégrité, les
  droits qu'il tient de Dieu à la couronne de France; 2º que rien n'a
  pu dégager les Français, ses sujets, de la fidélité qu'ils doivent
  à ce prince, en vertu de la loi de Dieu_.

  [30] M. de Talleyrand-Périgord, plus tard cardinal et archevêque
  de Paris.

Je reviens à ce qui se passa en 1801 et les années suivantes. Le pape
vit le concordat en pleine activité sans qu'il en résultât aucun
trouble en France; malgré la diversité des opinions, les oppositions y
étaient légères, rares et sans suite.

Il faut bien, cependant, dire ici que Pie VII avait déployé dans cette
circonstance une autorité qui sortait des règles ordinaires, et qui
n'eût pas été reconnue dans un autre temps, si un pape eût essayé de
l'exercer: celle de destituer des évêques sans jugement, comme aussi
celle de supprimer plus de la moitié des évêchés de France sans
formalité. A une autre époque, rien n'eût paru, en France, plus opposé
aux libertés de l'Église gallicane. Mais le cas était ici hors de
toute comparaison avec les temps ordinaires; il était impossible et
presque dérisoire d'invoquer et de vouloir appliquer ici l'exercice de
ces libertés. Le pape avait vainement épuisé les plus puissantes
instances auprès de cette minorité composée de trente-six évêques, et
alors, s'appuyant sur la majorité de l'épiscopat français, il employa
le _seul_ moyen possible d'éteindre le schisme qu'il était si urgent
de faire cesser. Quel autre moyen, en effet, aurait pu employer le
pape? Que l'on cherche, on ne pourra même pas en imaginer un. L'abbé
Fleury[31], tout zélé gallican qu'il était, et très peu disposé
assurément à étendre l'autorité du pape, n'en dit pas moins dans son
discours sur _les libertés de l'Église gallicane_, que: «l'autorité du
pape _est souveraine et s'élève au-dessus de tout_», lorsqu'il s'agit
de maintenir les règles et de faire observer les canons. Bossuet
tient aussi un semblable langage: «On doit dire, conséquemment, à plus
forte raison (ajoute M. Émery[32], dans un de ses ouvrages), que
l'autorité du pape est souveraine et s'élève au-dessus de tout, et
même des canons, quand il s'agit de la conservation de l'Église ou
d'une partie notable de l'Église, puisque ce n'est que pour le
_maintien_ de ces grands intérêts que ces règles et ces canons ont été
faits.»--Le Père Thomassin[33], dans son grand et célèbre ouvrage sur
la discipline de l'Église, dit aussi: «Rien n'est plus conforme aux
canons que de violer les canons, quand, de cette violation, il doit
résulter un plus grand bien que de leur observance même.»

  [31] L'abbé Claude Fleury, né en 1640, fut d'abord précepteur des
  fils du prince de Conti, puis sous-gouverneur des ducs de
  Bourgogne, d'Anjou et de Berry. En 1716, il vint de nouveau à la
  cour comme confesseur de Louis XV. Il se démit peu après de cette
  charge et mourut en 1723. L'abbé Fleury a laissé un grand nombre
  d'ouvrages d'histoire ecclésiastique et de controverse religieuse.

  [32] Jacques-André Émery, né en 1732, reçut les ordres en 1756, fut
  professeur de théologie à Orléans, fut nommé, en 1776, grand
  vicaire du diocèse d'Angers, supérieur du séminaire de cette ville,
  et peu après supérieur général de l'ordre de Saint-Sulpice. Sous la
  Terreur, il fut emprisonné durant dix-huit mois. Après le 9
  thermidor, il fut chargé des fonctions de grand vicaire du diocèse
  de Paris. Sous le consulat, il réorganisa sa congrégation. Il fit
  partie des deux commissions ecclésiastiques réunies par l'empereur,
  et mourut en 1811.

  [33] Louis de Thomassin, né à Aix, en 1619, entra dans la
  congrégation de l'Oratoire, enseigna la philosophie et les
  belles-lettres dans plusieurs collèges de province, et fut en 1654,
  nommé professeur de théologie au séminaire Saint-Magloire, à Paris.
  Il composa un très grand nombre d'ouvrages d'histoire religieuse.
  L'ouvrage dont il est ici question: _Ancienne et nouvelle
  discipline de l'Église touchant les bénéfices_, fut publié à Paris
  en 1678. Le Père Thomassin mourut en 1695.

Pie VII montra donc, à la fois, dans cette difficile circonstance, un
grand caractère et une connaissance profonde des véritables principes
en agissant comme il le fit. Il éteignit le schisme sans irriter, sans
humilier les évêques constitutionnels, et pourtant, sans leur céder
aucun point, et le calme se rétablit partout.

Il y eut, toutefois, quelques consciences agitées dans les diocèses
dont les anciens titulaires n'avaient pas donné leur démission.
Quelques-uns, parmi ceux-ci, tout en se réservant leur juridiction,
avaient consenti, néanmoins, à l'exercice des pouvoirs de l'évêque qui
les remplaçait et suppléé par là à l'insuffisance de son titre. Mais
les plus vifs dans leur résistance, ceux qui, par opinion politique,
s'étaient montrés le plus ennemis de la Révolution dans son principe,
et qui étaient imperturbablement dominés par ce sentiment, n'eurent
garde de le faire. Cette opposition persistante ne produisit, au
surplus, ni l'effet ni les suites qu'ils s'en promettaient et qu'ils
auraient dû en redouter. Ceux de leurs diocésains dont la conscience
était plus particulièrement timorée, inquiets peut-être un instant, ne
tardèrent pas à comprendre que leur ancien évêque n'ayant voulu ni
venir au milieu d'eux, ni donner sa démission sur la demande du pape,
ils étaient assurément à l'abri de tout reproche en accordant, dans
des circonstances semblables, leur confiance au nouvel évêque que le
Saint-Père leur envoyait.

Les évêques restés à Londres virent sûrement avec douleur que des
hommes imbus de leur doctrine, tels que l'abbé Blanchard[34] et l'abbé
Gaschet, poussant à l'extrême les conséquences (assez bien déduites
pourtant) de ces doctrines, publièrent en Angleterre, et
introduisirent autant qu'ils le purent en France, une foule de
libelles contre le pape, où, dans un style frénétique et qui semblait
copié de Luther, ils le déclaraient hérétique, schismatique, déchu de
la papauté, déchu même du sacerdoce; ils disaient que c'était un
blasphème de prononcer son nom au canon de la messe, qu'il était aussi
étranger à l'Église que l'était un juif ou un païen. Ils parlaient de
ses attentats, de ses scandales, etc... Je n'altère pas une syllabe.
Croyons pour l'honneur des évêques qui formaient ce qu'on appelait
alors _la petite Église_ que, quelque opposants qu'ils fussent, ils
n'approuvèrent pas ces fureurs insensées, quoiqu'elles parussent leur
être dédiées. Elles furent, au surplus, solennellement condamnées par
vingt-neuf évêques catholiques d'Irlande et par les vicaires
apostoliques qui résidaient à Londres. Ce qu'il faut ajouter, c'est
qu'en France, où on répandit ces libelles, un mépris universel en fit
une complète justice. Je crois que la police les déféra ou voulut les
déférer un jour aux tribunaux, mais cela même ne put les faire sortir
de leur profonde obscurité.

  [34] L'abbé Pierre-Louis Blanchard, né en 1762, était professeur de
  philosophie en 1789. Ayant refusé le serment, il émigra en
  Angleterre, où il resta jusqu'en 1814. De sa retraite il publia un
  grand nombre de factums et de libelles, où il s'élève avec la
  dernière violence contre ceux qui portent atteinte aux intérêts de
  la religion. Il attaque le concordat, et n'épargne même pas le
  pape, principalement à l'occasion du sacre de l'empereur. Ses
  nombreux écrits ont été publiés à Londres.

Bonaparte avait fait décréter, sous forme de loi, en même temps que le
concordat, des _articles organiques_, tant pour le clergé catholique
que pour le culte protestant. Plusieurs de ces articles déplurent au
pape, en ce qu'ils paraissaient mettre l'Église de France dans une
trop grande dépendance du gouvernement, même pour des détails
secondaires. Il s'en plaignit avec modération, en demanda la réforme;
obtint peu à peu, et même sans beaucoup de difficultés, des
modifications essentielles. Quelques-uns de ces articles étaient
d'ailleurs transitoires; leurs effets devaient cesser avec les
circonstances qui les avaient provoqués. Il en était d'autres qui
découlaient naturellement des anciennes libertés gallicanes; on ne
pouvait pas accorder la réforme de ceux-ci, et le pape ne dut pas
l'espérer. Pour faire le concordat, on avait été obligé de renoncer
momentanément à ces libertés; le concordat fait, il était urgent de
rentrer dans nos privilèges. Tout ce qui était véritablement
nécessaire avait été accordé, sinon tout de suite, du moins avec le
temps. Le pape fut parfaitement secondé dans ses désirs par l'évêque
de Nantes, comme on le verra plus bas, et par son légat, le cardinal
Caprara. Celui-ci, connaissant le caractère du premier consul, mit une
grande sagesse et une mesure extrême dans toute sa conduite, sachant
attendre, craignant d'irriter, et trop heureux de ce qu'on avait
obtenu pour chercher à le compromettre.

Le cardinal Caprara, nommé légat _a latere_ près de Bonaparte, avait
été investi des pouvoirs les plus étendus par la bulle _Dextera_... du
mois d'août 1801, et par la bulle _Quoniam_... du 29 novembre de la
même année, pour exécuter le concordat, instituer les nouveaux
évêques... et résoudre toutes les difficultés qui pourraient s'élever.
Mais, quoique le concordat eût été conclu et signé à Paris, le 15
juillet 1801, et ratifié à Rome par Pie VII, au mois d'août suivant,
il n'avait été converti en loi (à raison de l'absence du Corps
législatif), que le 8 avril 1802; et ce ne fut que de ce jour-là que
le légat put exercer ses fonctions et instituer les nouveaux évêques,
après avoir prêté ce même jour (8 avril) serment entre les mains du
premier consul. On peut remarquer dans son serment, mais avec des yeux
bien exercés, une légère différence entre ce qui avait été réglé par
l'arrêté des consuls et les termes dont il se servit. L'arrêté portait
ce peu de mots: «Il jurera et promettra suivant la formule usitée de
se conformer aux lois de l'État, et aux libertés de l'Église
gallicane.»--Or, le cardinal _jura_ et _promit_ (en latin) d'observer
la constitution, les lois, les statuts et usages de la république
française, et en même temps: «de ne déroger en aucune manière à
l'autorité et juridiction du gouvernement de la république, ainsi
qu'aux droits, libertés et privilèges de l'Église gallicane.»--Le tout
précédé d'un compliment au premier consul, tel qu'on n'en fit jamais,
peut-être, à aucun souverain. On peut voir, en y regardant de près,
qu'au lieu de promettre de _se conformer_ aux libertés de l'Église
gallicane (ce qui comporte une sorte d'adhésion, ou du moins de
reconnaissance de ces libertés), il promit seulement de n'y déroger en
rien, ce qui est purement négatif. La différence au reste est bien
minime, ou même nulle, quant au résultat, et l'on ne dut pas s'y
arrêter. D'ailleurs, il promit, dans l'autre partie du serment, au
delà de ce qu'on lui avait demandé, car on voulait qu'il jurât de se
conformer _aux lois de l'État_, et lui, jura positivement _d'observer
la constitution, les lois, les statuts et les usages_ de la
république, ce qui est plus expressif.

Quant aux libertés de l'Église gallicane, qui font peur à la cour de
Rome, s'engager par serment à ne pas y déroger est assurément tout ce
qu'on pouvait attendre d'un légat, surtout si l'on songe qu'aucun pape
ne les a jamais reconnues. Innocent XII[35] (Odescalchi) bouleversa
pendant huit ans l'Église de France, à cause de ces mêmes libertés
consacrées dans l'assemblée du clergé de 1682, et refusa constamment
d'accorder des bulles aux ecclésiastiques du second ordre, membres de
cette assemblée (où ils n'avaient cependant pas voix délibérative).
Son successeur, Alexandre VIII[36] (Ottoboni), fut plus opiniâtre
encore dans ses refus, puisque deux jours avant sa mort il publia une
bulle contre les quatre articles de 1682, laquelle, au reste, n'eut
pas de suite, parce qu'il était mourant. Innocent XII[37] (Pignatelli)
tout bonhomme qu'il était, ne put se résoudre à accorder des bulles
aux évêques nommés entre 1682 et 1693, qu'après qu'ils lui eurent
écrit chacun une lettre d'excuses et de regrets sur ce qui s'était
passé dans cette assemblée. Cette lettre était vraiment humiliante, et
ce qui lui donna surtout ce caractère, c'est que Louis XIV en joignit
une de sa propre main, dans laquelle il s'engageait à ne donner aucune
suite à son édit du 22 mars 1682. La lettre du roi dut paraître une
rétractation, dont il se releva pourtant avant sa mort, puisqu'enfin,
l'édit ne fut pas révoqué, et qu'après lui, il continua d'être
exécuté.

  [35] Innocent XI (Benoît Odescalchi), né à Côme en 1611, pape en
  1671, mort en 1689.

  [36] Alexandre VIII, né à Venise en 1610, pape en 1689. Il cassa
  les articles de la déclaration de 1682 par la bulle _Inter
  multiplices_, et mourut en 1691.

  [37] Innocent XII (Antoine Pignatelli), né à Naples en 1615, pape
  de 1691 à 1700.

Il est presque inutile de rappeler ici que Bonaparte, proclamé
empereur par le Sénat le 20 mai 1804, mit un grand prix, et cela se
conçoit, à être sacré par le pape. C'est un miracle de sa destinée
qu'il ait pu l'obtenir, et dans le temps, je me trouvai fort heureux
d'y avoir contribué, parce que je pensais que les liens de la France
avec la cour de Rome s'en trouveraient resserrés. Pie VII, ayant déjà
reconnu le gouvernement consulaire, puisque c'est avec ce gouvernement
qu'il avait traité pour le concordat, ne pouvait être arrêté par la
considération des droits que pourrait, un jour, faire valoir la maison
de Bourbon, si le gouvernement nouveau, se brisant lui-même, la
nation la rappelait. Il n'avait donc rien à objecter contre le titre
d'empereur que Bonaparte s'était donné, ou qui lui avait été décerné
en France, avec plus de solennité, quoique, peut-être, avec moins de
sincérité, que celui de premier consul. Le pape n'avait plus à
délibérer que sur un seul point: savoir, si, dans l'unique intérêt de
la religion, à laquelle le nouvel empereur pouvait faire, par sa
puissance immense, tant de bien ou tant de mal, il devait consentir à
le venir sacrer, comme saint Boniface, le légat du pape Étienne III,
était venu sacrer Pépin, du vivant du roi légitime, Childéric III;
comme Léon III couronna Charlemagne empereur, à Rome en 800, et comme
un autre pape, Étienne V, vint ensuite sacrer Louis le Débonnaire à
Reims, après la mort de Charlemagne.

Le pape se décida à venir faire ce sacre à Paris, et cette mémorable
cérémonie eut lieu le 2 décembre 1804. Pie VII ne fut pas dirigé dans
cette circonstance par des vues temporelles, comme le pape Étienne
III, qui avait imploré le secours de Pépin contre les Lombards, mais
bien évidemment et bien uniquement par des motifs purement religieux,
puisqu'il s'abstint même de laisser entrevoir le désir si naturel de
recouvrer ses trois légations de Bologne, de Ferrare et de Ravenne,
que l'empereur, au reste, n'eut garde de lui offrir, ni même de lui
faire espérer. Toutes les demandes du pape, sans aucune exception,
furent dans l'intérêt de la religion. Aucune ne le regardait
personnellement, et il refusa les présents qu'on lui offrit pour sa
famille.

Il quitta Paris le 4 avril 1805, laissant partout sur son passage
l'impression profonde de ses vertus et de sa bonté: Napoléon avait
quitté Paris quelques jours avant lui; il songeait à tout autre
chose, qu'à montrer sa reconnaissance au Saint-Père. Le 16 mai le pape
arrive à Rome, et le 26 mai, l'empereur se fait couronner à Milan roi
d'Italie. Peu de temps après, ses troupes occupent Ancône, sur le
territoire romain[38]. Le pape s'en plaint. Napoléon ne lui répond
pas; mais après la bataille d'Austerlitz du 2 décembre 1805 et la paix
de Presbourg du 26, il écrit au pape, le 6 janvier 1806, qu'il n'avait
pas voulu s'approprier Ancône, mais l'occuper comme protecteur du
Saint-Siège, et pour que cette ville ne fût pas souillée par les
musulmans.

  [38] Ancône avait à ce moment une grande importance. Des troupes
  russes étaient concentrées à Corfou, d'où elles n'attendaient
  qu'une occasion pour passer en Italie et se joindre aux Anglais.
  Ancône était donc exposée à un coup de main, d'autant plus que la
  garnison était presque nulle, et les fortifications ruinées.
  Napoléon sollicita du gouvernement pontifical qu'il mît la ville en
  état de défense. Sa demande n'obtint aucun résultat. Aussitôt le
  général Gouvion Saint-Cyr, qui à ce moment traversait les États de
  l'Église pour se rendre dans le royaume de Naples, reçut l'ordre de
  s'emparer de la ville. Il y entra par surprise, et s'y établit le 6
  novembre 1805.

Trois mois après, le 30 mars 1806, Napoléon place son frère Joseph sur
le trône de Naples, et demande au pape de le reconnaître. Il lui
demande presque en même temps de faire avec lui (empereur) une ligue
offensive et défensive, d'embrasser le système continental, de fermer
par conséquent ses ports aux Anglais, c'est-à-dire de leur déclarer la
guerre. De telles propositions, dans un temps surtout où l'empereur
foulait aux pieds le concordat qu'il avait conclu avec le pape en 1803
pour l'Italie; qu'il dépouillait les évêchés et les monastères de
leurs biens, supprimant à son gré les uns et les autres; qu'il
tourmentait les évêques et les curés par de nouveaux serments, etc...
de telles propositions ne pouvaient pas être acceptées et ne le
furent pas. Elles donnèrent lieu à cette correspondance avec les
autorités françaises, dans laquelle on a remarqué tant de force, de
raison et de convenance du côté de la cour de Rome.

Un pareil refus et tant de raison, ne pouvaient manquer d'irriter
l'empereur. Le 2 février 1808 il fait occuper Rome par ses troupes que
commandait le général Miollis[39]. Elles s'emparent du château
Saint-Ange. Le général veut obliger le pape à souscrire à toutes les
demandes qui lui sont faites, sous la menace de perdre ses États; il
prodigue les vexations; se saisit de la poste, des imprimeries; fait
enlever vingt cardinaux, parmi lesquels étaient plusieurs ministres,
etc... Le pape proteste en vain contre de telles violences. Napoléon
n'en tient aucun compte. Le 2 avril suivant, il réunit au royaume
d'Italie les légations d'Urbin, d'Ancône, de Macerata et de Camerino,
pour en faire trois départements. Il confisque les biens des cardinaux
qui ne se rendaient pas au lieu de leur naissance. Il fait désarmer
presque toute la garde du Saint-Père; les nobles de cette garde sont
emprisonnés. Enfin, Miollis fait enlever le cardinal Gabrielle[40],
pro-secrétaire d'État; et fait mettre les scellés sur ses papiers.

  [39] François, comte Miollis, né en 1759, était capitaine
  d'infanterie en 1789. Il servit dans les années de la république,
  devint général en 1794, et fit avec distinction la campagne
  d'Italie. Il fut longtemps gouverneur de Mantoue. En 1807, il fut
  nommé gouverneur de Rome et des États de l'Église. Il fut mis à la
  retraite en 1815 et mourut en 1828.

  [40] Jules Gabrielle, issu d'une vieille famille romaine, né en
  1748, fut évêque de Sinigaglia, puis cardinal en 1801. Le 27 mars
  1808, il devint pro-secrétaire d'État. Il protesta énergiquement
  contre toutes les mesures attentatoires aux droits du pape
  ordonnées par l'empereur, et fut arrêté en juin de la même année.
  Il fut interné en France et se rendit en 1813 à Fontainebleau
  auprès du pape. Il mourut en 1822.

Le 17 mai 1809, décret de Napoléon, daté de Vienne, portant réunion
(en sa qualité de successeur de Charlemagne) des États du pape à
l'empire français, en statuant que la ville de Rome serait ville
impériale et libre; que le pape continuerait à y siéger, et qu'il
jouirait de deux millions de francs de revenu. Le 10 juin il fait
promulguer ce décret à Rome. Ce même 10 juin, le pape proteste contre
toutes ces spoliations, refuse toute pension; et, récapitulant tous
les attentats dont il a à se plaindre, lance la fameuse et imprudente
bulle d'excommunication contre les auteurs, fauteurs et exécuteurs des
violences contre lui et le Saint-Siège, mais sans nommer personne.

Napoléon en fut outré, et, dans un premier mouvement, il écrivit aux
évêques de France une lettre dans laquelle il parlait, en termes
presque révolutionnaires, «de celui qui voulait, disait-il, faire
dépendre d'un temporel périssable l'intérêt éternel des consciences et
celui de toutes les affaires spirituelles».

Le 6 juillet 1809, Pie VII, enlevé de Rome après qu'on lui eut demandé
s'il voulait renoncer à la souveraineté temporelle de Rome et de
l'État de l'Église, fut conduit par le général Radet[41] jusqu'à
Savone, où il arriva seul le 10 août, les cardinaux ayant tous été
transportés auparavant à Paris.

  [41] Étienne, baron Radet, né en 1762, avait été sous-officier sous
  l'ancien régime. En 1792, il était sous-lieutenant de la garde
  nationale à Varennes. Accusé d'avoir favorisé la fuite de Louis
  XVI, il fut acquitté par le tribunal révolutionnaire. Il devint
  général de brigade en 1799, et commandant en chef de la
  gendarmerie. C'est en cette qualité qu'il reçut l'ordre, le 6
  juillet 1809, d'arrêter le pape. En 1813, il fut nommé grand prévôt
  de la grande armée et général de division. Condamné à neuf ans de
  détention en 1816, il fut gracié en 1818 et mourut en 1825.

Et pour bien compléter les spoliations exercées sur le pape, Napoléon
fit paraître, le 17 février 1810, un sénatus-consulte qui décerne au
fils aîné de l'empereur le titre de roi de Rome, et statue même que
l'empereur sera sacré une seconde fois à Rome, dans les dix premières
années de son règne.

C'est opprimé, captif, et privé de tout conseil, que le pape refusa
les bulles à tous les évêques nommés par l'empereur, et c'est alors
que commencèrent les discussions sur les mesures propres à faire
cesser la viduité des églises.


CONSEIL ECCLÉSIASTIQUE

_Formé en 1809._

Ce conseil était composé du cardinal Fesch, du cardinal Maury[42], de
l'archevêque de Tours[43], de l'évêque de Nantes[44], de l'évêque
d'Évreux[45], de l'évêque de Trêves[46], de l'évêque de Verceil[47],
de M. l'abbé Émery, supérieur de Saint-Sulpice, et du père
Fontana[48], général des barnabites.

  [42] Jean Maury, né en 1746 à Valréas (Vaucluse), était fils d'un
  cordonnier. Il reçut les ordres en 1771, et se rendit bientôt
  célèbre par son éloquence: il entra à l'Académie en 1784. Député du
  clergé de Péronne aux états généraux, il devint le chef du parti
  droit. Il émigra en 1791, alla à Rome, fut nommé archevêque _in
  partibus_, cardinal et évêque de Montefiascone. Peu après, Louis
  XVIII l'accrédita comme ambassadeur près le Saint-Siège. Cependant
  il se rallia à l'empereur en 1806 et devint sénateur et aumônier du
  prince Jérôme. En 1810, il fut appelé au siège archiépiscopal de
  Paris, ce qui le fit condamner par le pape et lui valut plus tard
  la disgrâce de Louis XVIII. En 1814, il dut quitter son archevêché
  et gagna l'Italie. Il fut un instant détenu au château Saint-Ange,
  mais relâché peu après. Il rentra en grâce auprès de Pie VII, et
  mourut en 1817.

  [43] Louis, comte de Barral, né en 1746, avait été agent général du
  clergé en 1785, puis coadjuteur de l'évêque de Troyes et évêque _in
  partibus_. Il refusa le serment et émigra. En 1801, il envoya sa
  démission au pape, et fut peu après nommé évêque de Meaux, puis
  archevêque de Tours. En 1805, il accepta la charge d'aumônier de
  l'impératrice et, plus tard, la dignité de sénateur. M. de Barral
  prononça, en 1814, l'oraison funèbre de l'impératrice Joséphine.
  C'est également lui, qui, le 1er juin 1815, officia pontificalement
  sur le Champ-de-Mars. A la rentrée de Louis XVIII, il fut forcé de
  donner sa démission; il mourut en 1818.

  [44] M. Duvoisin.

  [45] M. Bourlier.

  [46] M. Mannay.

  [47] Jean-Baptiste Canaveri, né en 1753, entra dans l'ordre des
  Oratoriens en 1771, devint évêque de Bielle en 1797, puis de
  Verceil en 1808. Il fut, peu après, nommé premier aumônier de
  madame Lætitia Bonaparte. Il mourut en 1818.

  [48] François-Louis Fontana, né en 1750, entra dans la congrégation
  des Barnabites en 1767, et fut élu supérieur de son ordre dans la
  province de Milan. Il accompagna en 1804 le pape à Paris, et devint
  ensuite procureur général de son ordre, consulteur des rites et
  enfin général de sa congrégation. Après l'enlèvement du pape, il
  fut interné à Arcis-sur-Aube, fit partie de la commission
  ecclésiastique de 1809, mais n'assista qu'aux premières séances.
  Arrêté et emprisonné l'année suivante, il ne recouvra sa liberté
  qu'en 1814, revint à Rome, fut nommé cardinal en 1819 et mourut en
  1822.

Le gouvernement lui proposa trois séries de questions: La première sur
ce qui intéresse la chrétienté en général.--La seconde sur ce qui
intéressa la France en particulier.--La troisième sur ce qui intéresse
les Églises d'Allemagne, d'Italie et la bulle d'excommunication.

Chacune de ces séries se divisait en plusieurs questions. Je vais les
donner toutes avec les réponses que j'ai abrégées mais sans les
altérer, en ayant soin de souligner les expressions du conseil, ainsi
que les citations qu'il invoque.

Dans le préambule qui est en tête des réponses faites par le conseil
aux questions posées par le gouvernement, on remarque d'abord ces
paroles: _Nous ne séparons pas de l'hommage que nous rendons à Votre
Majesté le tribut d'intérêt, de zèle et d'amour que nous commande la
situation actuelle du Souverain Pontife... Tout le bien spirituel
que nous pouvons attendre du résultat de nos délibérations est donc
uniquement entre les mains de Votre Majesté..., et nous osons espérer
qu'elle jouira bientôt de cette gloire, si elle daigne seconder nos
voeux en accélérant une réunion si désirable entre Votre Majesté et le
Souverain Pontife, par l'entière liberté du pape, environné de ses
conseillers naturels, sans lesquels il ne peut ni communiquer avec les
Églises confiées à sa sollicitude, ni résoudre aucune grande question,
ni pourvoir aux besoins de la catholicité._


PREMIÈRE SÉRIE: PREMIÈRE QUESTION.--Le gouvernement de l'Église est-il
arbitraire?

_Réponse._--Non. Il appartient, il est vrai, spécialement au
successeur de saint Pierre, qui en est le chef, ayant primauté
d'honneur et de juridiction dans toute l'Église; mais, il appartient
aussi aux évêques, successeurs des apôtres; et, quelque éminente que
soit l'autorité de la chaire apostolique, _elle est réglée dans son
exercice par les canons, c'est-à-dire par les lois communes de toute
l'Église_. Le pape saint Martin écrivait à un évêque: _Nous sommes les
défenseurs et les dépositaires et non les transgresseurs des saints
canons._--_C'est en les observant, et les faisant observer aux
autres_, dit Bossuet, _que l'Église de Rome s'éleva éminemment
au-dessus des autres_.--Le conseil ajoute que les usages dont les
Églises particulières sont en possession, et qui prennent leur source
_dans l'ancienne discipline, font loi pour ces Églises. Ils forment en
quelque sorte son droit commun et doivent être respectés._ Il invoque
l'autorité du pape saint Grégoire qui dit expressément, en parlant de
l'Église d'Afrique: _Les usages qui ne nuisent point à la foi
catholique doivent demeurer intacts._

DEUXIÈME QUESTION.--Le pape peut-il, pour des motifs d'affaires
temporelles, refuser son intervention dans les affaires spirituelles?

_Réponse._--_La primauté dont le pape jouit de droit divin, étant tout
à l'avantage spirituel de l'Église, nous croyons ici lui rendre
hommage en répondant que si les affaires temporelles n'ont par
elles-mêmes aucun rapport nécessaire avec le spirituel, si elles
n'empêchent pas le chef de l'Église de remplir librement les fonctions
du nonce apostolique, le pape ne peut pas, par le seul motif des
affaires temporelles, refuser son intervention dans les affaires
spirituelles._

TROISIÈME QUESTION--Il est hors de doute que depuis un certain
temps la cour de Rome est resserrée dans un petit nombre de familles,
que les affaires de l'Église y sont examinées et traitées par un petit
nombre de prélats et de théologiens, pris dans de petites localités
des environs... Dans cet état de choses, convient-il de réunir un
concile?

_Réponse._--_S'il s'agit ici d'un concile général, il ne pourrait se
tenir sans le chef de l'Église, autrement il ne représenterait pas
l'Église universelle... S'il s'agit d'un concile national, son
autorité serait insuffisante pour régler un objet qui intéresserait
toute la catholicité entière._

QUATRIÈME QUESTION.--Ne faudrait-il pas que le consistoire, ou le
conseil particulier du pape, fût composé de prélats de toutes les
nations pour éclairer Sa Sainteté?

_Réponse._--Le concile de Bâle avait décidé (avec quelques clauses
limitatives) que les cardinaux seraient pris de tous les États
catholiques. Les orateurs du roi de France au concile de Trente
renouvelèrent les propositions que le concile de Bâle avait adoptées,
et ce concile se borna à décider _que le pape prendrait des
cardinaux de toutes les nations, autant que cela pourrait se faire
commodément, et selon qu'il les en trouverait dignes_.

Le conseil dit qu'il ne peut que former des voeux pour l'exécution de
cette mesure qui répond au désir de Sa Majesté.

CINQUIÈME QUESTION.--En supposant qu'il soit reconnu qu'il n'y a pas
de nécessité de faire des changements dans l'organisation actuelle,
l'empereur ne réunit-il pas sur sa tête les droits qui étaient sur
celles des rois de France, des ducs de Brabant et autres souverains
des Pays-Bas, des rois de Sardaigne, des ducs de Toscane..., soit pour
la nomination des cardinaux, soit pour toute autre prérogative?

_Réponse._--Le conseil pense que l'empereur, très naturellement, est
fondé à réclamer les prérogatives des souverainetés réunies à
l'empire.


DEUXIÈME SÉRIE.--Questions qui intéressent la France en particulier.

PREMIÈRE QUESTION.--Sa Majesté l'empereur ou ses ministres, ont-ils
porté atteinte au concordat?

_Réponse._--Le conseil pense que le pape n'a pas lieu de se plaindre
_d'aucune contravention essentielle_ faite au concordat. Quant aux
articles organiques, ajoutés au concordat, le conseil convient que le
pape remit, pendant son séjour à Paris, des représentations à
l'empereur sur un certain nombre de ces articles _qu'il jugeait
contraires au libre exercice de la religion catholique. Mais plusieurs
des articles dont se plaignait Sa Sainteté ne sont que des
applications ou des conséquences des maximes et des usages reçus dans
l'Église gallicane, dont ni l'empereur ni le clergé de France ne
peuvent se départir._

_Quelques autres à la vérité_, ajoute-t-il, _renferment des
dispositions qui seraient très préjudiciables à l'Église, si elles
étaient exécutées à la rigueur. On a tout lieu de croire qu'elles ont
été ajoutées au concordat comme des règlements de circonstance, comme
des ménagements jugés nécessaires pour aplanir la voie au
rétablissement du culte catholique; et nous espérons de la justice et
de la religion de Sa Majesté, qu'elle daignera les révoquer ou les
modifier de manière à dissiper les inquiétudes qu'elles ont fait
naître._

Le conseil en indique trois: Le premier, sur les bulles, brefs... qui
ne devaient être reçus, ni mis à exécution, sans l'autorisation du
gouvernement. Il désire qu'on excepte les _brefs de pénitencerie_, qui
étaient formellement exceptés par les parlements.--Le vingt-sixième
sur la fixation à trois cents francs du titre ou revenu exigé des
ecclésiastiques, pour être ordonnés par l'évêque; tandis qu'il n'était
que de cent cinquante francs avant la Révolution où les aspirants,
pris pour la plupart dans des classes élevées, étaient bien plus
riches.--Le trente-sixième sur les vicaires généraux qui devaient, par
cet article, continuer leurs fonctions, même après la mort de
l'évêque, tandis qu'il est de principe que les pouvoirs du grand
vicaire expirent avec celui qui les a donnés, que le chapitre se
trouve de plein droit investi de la juridiction épiscopale, et que
c'est par lui que sont nommés les vicaires généraux qui gouvernent
pendant la vacance du siège.

Il est juste de remarquer que ces trois demandes furent accordées par
décret, le 28 février 1810.

DEUXIÈME QUESTION.--L'état du clergé de France est-il, en général,
amélioré ou empiré depuis que le concordat est en vigueur?

La réponse est ici la plus affirmative, la plus détaillée, la plus
riche en faits. Outre la liberté du culte catholique qui est, à elle
seule, le plus grand des bienfaits dus au concordat, que de nouveaux
bienfaits depuis cette époque! Dotation des chapitres; trente mille
succursales pensionnées; quatre cents bourses et huit cents
demi-bourses pour les séminaires; exemption de la conscription pour
les étudiants présentés par l'évêque; invitation aux conseils généraux
de département de suppléer aux dotations des évêques, des chapitres,
et de pourvoir aux besoins du culte; rétablissement des congrégations
religieuses vouées à l'enseignement gratuit, au soulagement des
pauvres et des malades, etc... Tous ces faits sont évidents.

TROISIÈME QUESTION.--Si le gouvernement français n'a point violé le
concordat, le pape peut-il, arbitrairement, refuser l'institution aux
archevêques et évêques nommés, et perdre la religion en France, comme
il l'a perdue en Allemagne, qui, depuis dix ans, est sans évêques?

_Réponse.--Le concordat est un contrat synallagmatique entre le chef
de l'État et le chef de l'Église, par lequel chacun d'eux s'oblige
envers l'autre_... C'EST AUSSI _un traité public par lequel chacune
des parties contractantes acquiert des droits et s'impose des
obligations. Le droit réservé au pape ne doit pas être exercé
arbitrairement. Par le concordat entre le roi François Ier et Léon
X[49] (1515), le pape était tenu d'accorder les bulles d'institution
aux sujets nommés par le souverain, ou d'alléguer les motifs
canoniques de son refus.--Pie VII est également lié envers l'empereur
et la France par le concordat qu'il a solennellement ratifié._

  [49] Ce concordat dont les bases furent jetées le 10 décembre 1515,
  dans une entrevue entre les deux souverains, ne fut signé que le 18
  août 1516. Il abolissait la pragmatique sanction, abandonnait au
  pape le revenu des annates et reconnaissait la supériorité du pape
  sur les conciles. Par contre, il donnait au roi le droit de nommer
  à toutes les prélatures de France.

Le Saint-Père ayant écrit de Savone, le 28 août 1809, une lettre au
cardinal Caprara pour exposer les motifs de _ses refus, le conseil ne
croit pas s'écarter du profond respect dont il est pénétré pour la
personne et la dignité suprême du chef de l'Église, en mettant sous
les yeux de l'empereur les réflexions qu'il oserait présenter à Sa
Sainteté elle-même, s'il était admis à l'honneur de conférer avec
elle._

Le pape donnait trois motifs de refus dans sa lettre: 1º Les
innovations religieuses introduites en France depuis le concordat, et
cependant il n'en articulait aucune qui fût une atteinte essentielle
portée à ce concordat. Les innovations connues avaient été en France
des bienfaits pour la religion. Le gouvernement avait fait droit aux
représentations sur les articles organiques, et, d'ailleurs, cette
plainte déjà ancienne, en ce qui concerne la France, n'avait point été
suivie, jusqu'alors, d'un refus de bulles de la part du pape.--2º Le
second motif était fondé sur les événements et les mesures politiques
qu'il ne lui appartenait pas de juger.--_L'événement principal_, dit
le conseil, _est le décret de 1809, portant réunion de l'État romain à
l'empire français. Ce motif est-il canonique? Est-il fondé sur les
principes et sur l'esprit de la religion?_ Le conseil répond: _La
religion nous apprend à ne pas confondre l'ordre spirituel et l'ordre
temporel; la juridiction que le pape exerce essentiellement de droit
divin est celle que saint Pierre a reçue de Jésus-Christ, la seule
qu'il ait pu transmettre à ses successeurs; et celle-ci est purement
spirituelle. La souveraineté temporelle n'est pour les papes qu'un
accessoire étranger à leur autorité. La première durera autant que
l'Église, autant que le monde; et l'autre, d'institution humaine,
n'étant point comprise dans les promesses divines qui ont été faites à
l'Église, peut être enlevée, comme elle a été donnée, par les hommes
et les événements. Dans toutes les suppositions à cet égard, et quelle
que soit la position politique du pape, son autorité dans l'Église
universelle et ses relations avec les Églises particulières doivent
être toujours les mêmes, et comme il n'a reçu ses pouvoirs que pour
l'avantage des fidèles et le gouvernement de l'Église_, le conseil se
persuade _que le Saint-Père mettrait un terme à ses refus, s'il était
convaincu, comme eux qui voient les choses de près, que ce refus ne
peut être que très préjudiciable à l'Église_.

D'après le conseil, _l'invasion de Rome ne peut donc être un motif
pour refuser l'institution canonique aux évêques nommés. Cette
invasion n'est pas une violation du concordat. Le concordat n'a rien
stipulé, rien garanti du temporel; et tant que la juridiction du pape
sur l'Église de France est reconnue, les liens qui attachent cette
Église à la chaire de saint Pierre ne sont point relâchés, et le
concordat subsiste dans son intégrité._

_Le pape reconnaît cette distinction dans sa lettre, mais il ne
pouvait_, dit-il, _sacrifier la défense du patrimoine de l'Église.
Cela n'est point contesté: il pouvait réclamer avec toute la force de
ses moyens. Mais comment le refus des bulles serait-il un de ces
moyens? Si l'empereur exigeait et obtenait des évêques nommés quelque
déclaration contraire à l'autorité du Saint-Siège, ou relative à
l'invasion des États romains, le pape serait dans son droit pour leur
refuser l'institution canonique; mais il n'y a rien de semblable dans
la circonstance. Comment donc pourrait-il vouloir ou croirait-il
pouvoir les punir pour un événement qui ne peut leur être imputé?
Lorsque Rome fut prise d'assaut par les troupes de Charles-Quint,
Clément VII, pour se venger de ce prince, a-t-il abandonné toutes les
Églises à l'anarchie?_--3º Le troisième motif de refus dans la lettre
du Saint-Père est pris dans sa situation actuelle. Dieu sait, dit le
pape, si nous désirons ardemment donner aux églises de France vacantes
leurs pasteurs, et si nous désirons trouver un expédient pour le faire
d'une manière convenable; mais devons-nous agir dans une affaire de si
haute importance sans consulter nos conseillers naturels? Or, comment
pourrions-nous les consulter, quand, séparé d'eux par la violence, on
nous a ôté toute libre communication avec eux, et, en outre, tous les
moyens nécessaires pour l'expédition de pareilles affaires, n'ayant pu
même, jusqu'à présent, obtenir d'avoir auprès de nous un seul de nos
secrétaires?

L'objection était forte, et le conseil se vit réduit à faire la
réponse suivante: _A ces dernières plaintes, nous n'avons d'autre
réponse à faire que de les mettre nous-mêmes sous les yeux de Sa
Majesté, qui en sentira toute la force et toute la justice._

Cette phrase n'était peut-être pas sans quelque courage, car c'était
justifier le refus du pape, et montrer clairement à l'empereur son
injustice et son inconséquence.

QUATRIÈME QUESTION.--Le gouvernement français n'ayant point violé le
concordat, si, d'un autre côté, le pape refuse de l'exécuter,
l'intention de Sa Majesté est de regarder le concordat comme abrogé,
mais, dans ce cas, que convient-il de faire pour le bien de la
religion?

_Réponse.--Si le pape persistait à se refuser à l'exécution du
concordat, il est certain, rigoureusement parlant, que l'empereur ne
serait plus tenu de l'observer, et qu'il pourrait le regarder comme
abrogé._--Ce sont les premiers mots de la réponse; ils ont l'air de
tout décider; mais, toutefois, ce n'était pas le cas, et le conseil
ajoute bientôt: _Mais le concordat n'est pas une transaction purement
personnelle... C'est un traité qui fait partie de notre droit
public... et il importe d'en réclamer l'exécution, dans la supposition
même où le Souverain Pontife persisterait à la refuser en ce qui le
concerne._

Ce raisonnement est subtil et même singulier: car le conseil semble
n'avoir mis en avant avec assurance un principe, que pour reculer plus
vite devant la conséquence, il semble même s'être étudié à faire
renaître la difficulté, au moment où elle paraissait assez nettement
résolue.

Le conseil dit ensuite qu'il faudrait regarder le concordat, non comme
abrogé, mais comme _suspendu_, en protestant toujours contre le refus
du pape, et en en appelant, ou au pape lui-même, mieux informé, ou à
son successeur.

_Mais, soit que le concordat soit regardé comme abrogé, soit qu'il
demeure suspendu_, ajoute le conseil, _que convient-il de faire pour
le bien de la religion_? (Ce sont les derniers mots de la
question.)--Ici le conseil établit avec clarté les principes et
n'épargne pour cela aucun raisonnement. _Tous les pouvoirs des
ministres de l'Église étant d'un ordre spirituel, c'est à l'Église
seule à les conférer. Les évêques ont des pouvoirs d'ordre et des
pouvoirs de juridiction. Dans les trois premiers siècles de
persécutions, il a bien fallu que l'Église seule investît les pasteurs
de ces pouvoirs, et elle n'a pas pu perdre ce droit quand les rois se
sont faits ses enfants. L'Église n'a jamais reconnu d'évêques que
ceux qu'elle avait institués; mais la manière de procéder à
l'élection, et puis de conférer l'institution, n'a pas toujours été la
même. Dans les premiers siècles, la simple nomination, ou élection, ou
présentation, appartenait aux évêques co-provinciaux, au clergé et au
peuple de l'Église qu'il fallait pourvoir; et cette élection était
confirmée par le métropolitain par qui l'évêque était sacré; ou s'il
s'agissait du métropolitain lui-même, par le concile de la province
qui conférait l'institution ou la mission, pour cette Église en
particulier, à celui qui venait d'être élu. Dans la suite, les
empereurs et autres princes chrétiens eurent grande part à la
nomination, c'est-à-dire à l'élection, et insensiblement, le peuple et
le clergé de la campagne cessèrent d'être appelés. L'élection passa
alors au chapitre de l'église cathédrale, mais toujours avec la
nécessité du consentement du prince (représentant le peuple), et de la
confirmation ou institution métropolitaine ou du concile de la
province._

Le conseil ecclésiastique oublia d'ajouter, que, jusqu'au XIIIe
siècle, les papes n'avaient été pour rien, ni dans l'élection, ni dans
l'institution. Depuis, par les réserves et autres principes puisés
dans les fausses décrétales[50], ils s'attribuèrent quelquefois et
l'élection et la confirmation. C'est à cet état de choses, si étranger
à l'ancienne discipline, puisqu'il n'y en avait pas de traces dans les
douze premiers siècles de l'Église, que le concile de Bâle ainsi que
la pragmatique sanction voulurent remédier. A la suite du concile de
Bâle et de la pragmatique sanction publiée à Bourges en 1438[51]
conformément aux décrets de ce concile, il avait été décidé que
l'élection par le peuple et par le chapitre, serait confirmée par le
métropolitain ou par le concile provincial. En 1516, on substitua à
cette pragmatique sanction, le concordat entre François Ier et Léon X,
en vertu duquel l'élection passa tout entière au roi, à la place du
peuple ou du chapitre, et la confirmation ou institution au pape, à la
place des métropolitains et des conciles provinciaux.

  [50] On connaît sous le nom de fausses décrétales un recueil de
  droit canonique du VIe siècle, attribué au moine Denys le Petit,
  qui tendait à augmenter considérablement la puissance des papes.

  [51] La pragmatique sanction de Bourges est le nom donné à
  l'ordonnance que le roi Charles VII rendit, en 1438, sur les
  affaires de l'Église de France.

Le conseil ecclésiastique reprend à l'occasion de ces changements:
_ces deux changements dans les élections ont été regardés comme faits
du consentement exprès ou tacite de l'Église. Nous dirons plus: cette
approbation_ (de l'Église) _serait encore indispensable, quand même on
proposerait de revenir à une des méthodes adoptées dans les siècles
précédents; car une loi abrogée n'est plus une loi, et elle ne peut en
reprendre le caractère que par le fait de l'autorité qui l'a
abrogée.--C'est là un des vices capitaux de la constitution civile du
clergé, adoptée par l'Assemblée constituante;... car, outre que les
élections décrétées par cette constitution ne ressemblaient, en aucune
manière, à celle des premiers siècles, l'Assemblée constituante, qui
n'avait que des pouvoirs politiques était essentiellement incompétente
pour rétablir, sans le concours et le consentement de l'Église, ces
règlements de discipline que l'Église avait abolis._

_Ainsi, dans la supposition où par la persévérance des refus des
bulles, le concordat serait regardé comme suspendu ou comme abrogé, on
ne serait pas autorisé à faire revivre la pragmatique sanction, à
moins que l'autorité ecclésiastique, n'intervînt dans son
rétablissement. Sans cela, elle deviendrait la source de troubles
semblables à ceux qu'a excités dans toute la France la constitution
civile du clergé en 1791._

_Que conviendrait-il donc de faire alors pour le bien de la religion?
car cette question revient toujours._

_Le conseil n'a pas l'autorité nécessaire pour indiquer les mesures
propres à remplacer l'intervention du pape dans la confirmation des
évêques._ (Cette réponse est-elle bien exacte? Est-ce donc qu'indiquer
ces mesures supposerait une autorité?)

_Le conseil pense que l'empereur ne peut rien faire de plus sage et de
plus conforme aux règles que de convoquer un concile national, qui
examinerait la question proposée et indiquerait les moyens propres à
prévenir les inconvénients du refus des bulles. En 1688, à l'occasion
d'un refus semblable de bulles fait par le pape Innocent XI aux
évêques, à la suite de l'assemblée du clergé de 1682, le parlement de
Paris, sur les conclusions du procureur général du Harlay, rendit un
arrêt portant que le roi serait supplié de convoquer les conciles
provinciaux ou même un concile national._

L'empereur, dans une note qu'il dicta à l'évêque de Nantes, M.
Duvoisin, trouva que cette réponse n'éclaircissait pas entièrement la
question. Il avait pensé, dit-il dans cette note, que, le concordat
tombant, la France rentrait de droit dans ce qui existait avant. Mais
le conseil l'avait fait changer d'avis, et il estimait maintenant avec
lui, que le concordat ayant abrogé la loi qui existait lors de sa
conclusion, elle ne pouvait plus être rétablie que par le pouvoir qui
l'avait abrogée, mais il différait de l'opinion du conseil, en ce
qu'il pensait que l'Église gallicane était suffisante pour prononcer
le rétablissement de l'ancienne loi, sans quoi il y aurait une lacune
dans la législation de l'Église. L'empereur n'expliquait pas davantage
sa pensée dans sa note, ayant été interrompu par d'autres affaires.

Le conseil ecclésiastique, cependant, sur le simple aperçu contenu
dans la note, discuta de nouveau la question, sans trop entrer dans
l'idée de l'empereur, car il commence par dire: _qu'il persiste à
croire que la convocation d'un concile national est la seule voie
canonique qui puisse conduire au but désiré_. Il suppose que, _le
concile adresserait d'abord au pape des remontrances respectueuses sur
les suites qu'entraînerait un refus plus longtemps prolongé; sur la
nécessité où se trouveraient l'empereur et le clergé de pourvoir par
une autre voie à la conservation de la religion et à la perpétuité de
l'épiscopat, et qu'on proposerait ensuite tous les moyens de
conciliation, etc... et si le pape se refusait à ces prières, à ces
sollicitations du clergé de France assemblé, le concile examinerait_
(ce que nous n'avons pas cru devoir faire) _s'il est compétent pour
rétablir ou renouveler un mode d'institution canonique qui pût
remplacer le mode établi par le concordat. S'il se jugeait compétent,
il arrêterait, sous le bon plaisir de Sa Majesté, un règlement de
discipline sur cet objet, mais en déclarant que ce règlement n'est que
provisoire, et que l'Église de France ne cessera point de demander
l'observation du concordat, toujours prête à y revenir... Et si le
concile national ne se jugeait pas compétent, il réclamerait le
recours à un concile général, la seule autorité dans l'Église qui soit
au-dessus du pape. Et si ce recours devenait impossible parce que le
pape ne voudrait pas reconnaître le concile, ni le présider, ou, que
dans les circonstances politiques, sa convocation présentât trop de
difficultés pour l'assembler,--que conviendrait-il de faire pour le
bien de la religion?--Vu l'impossibilité de recourir au concile
général, et vu le danger imminent dont l'Église est menacée, le
concile national pourrait déclarer que l'institution donnée par le
métropolitain à ses suffragants, ou par le plus ancien évêque de la
province à l'égard du métropolitain, tiendrait lieu des bulles
pontificales, jusqu'à ce que le pape ou ses successeurs consentissent
à la pleine exécution du concordat. C'est ici une loi de nécessité,
loi que le pape lui-même a cru pouvoir reconnaître, lorsque, s'élevant
au-dessus de toutes les règles ordinaires et par un acte d'autorité
sans exemple, il a supprimé tous les anciens évêchés de France pour en
créer de nouveaux._

Ne peut-on pas s'étonner que le conseil ecclésiastique, avant
d'arriver à une pareille solution, n'ait pas répété ici que, pour
faire cesser le principal motif d'opposition du pape (motif énoncé par
lui dans sa lettre au cardinal Caprara, où il déclare que son refus de
donner des bulles est fondé particulièrement sur ce que, dans sa
prison de Savone, il est privé de toute liberté), l'empereur était
prié de rendre au pape, au moins la mesure de liberté nécessaire pour
l'expédition des bulles, afin de le constituer dans son tort s'il
persistait alors à la refuser. Au lieu de cela, le conseil restait
toujours dans la supposition que le pape ne refusait les bulles que
pour des motifs purement temporels, et à cause surtout de l'invasion
de Rome, tandis que le Saint-Père avait formellement déclaré que
c'était parce qu'on l'avait privé de sa liberté, de son conseil et
même de son secrétaire, qu'il se refusait à faire expédier les bulles.

Le conseil, qui avait senti toute la force de cette réclamation, qui
en avait déjà reconnu toute la justice, aurait dû renouveler ses
instances à cet égard. La liberté réclamée ici par le pape n'était pas
un objet purement temporel; c'était une condition indispensable pour
valider les actes du plus simple citoyen, à plus forte raison ceux du
chef de l'Église. Le conseil, dans cette longue et dernière partie de
la discussion, a trop l'air de croire que tous les torts sont du côté
du pape. Est-ce complaisance ou pusillanimité?--Qu'il n'ait pas
conseillé à l'empereur de rendre Rome, cela se conçoit: il n'était pas
appelé à traiter cette question politique, qui était d'ailleurs tout à
fait indépendante de celle de la délivrance des bulles qu'on lui
soumettait; mais ne pas répéter chaque jour, qu'avant de songer au
concile ou à tout autre remède extraordinaire auquel on ne pouvait
avoir recours que dans le cas, où sans aucune raison, le pape
s'obstinerait à ne pas vouloir exécuter le concordat, il était
nécessaire de lui rendre assez de liberté pour qu'il ne pût pas se
plaindre qu'on lui faisait violence par une telle demande, c'était non
seulement une grande pusillanimité envers l'empereur, mais aussi,
c'était une inconséquence: c'était paraître vouloir prolonger la
rupture, lorsqu'il ne fallait peut-être qu'un mot pour la faire
cesser.


TROISIÈME SÉRIE.--Questions qui intéressent les Églises d'Allemagne,
d'Italie, et la bulle d'excommunication.

PREMIÈRE QUESTION.--Sa Majesté, qui peut, à juste titre, se considérer
comme le chrétien le plus puissant, sentirait sa conscience troublée,
s'il ne portait aucune attention aux plaintes des Églises d'Allemagne
sur l'abandon dans lequel le pape les laisse depuis dix ans. Elle
désire, comme _suzerain de l'Allemagne_, comme _héritier de
Charlemagne_, comme _véritable empereur d'Occident_, comme _fils aîné
de l'Église_, savoir quelle conduite elle doit tenir pour rétablir le
bienfait de la religion chez les peuples de l'Allemagne?

_Réponse._--Celle que donne le conseil à cette question est on ne peut
plus vague. Le rapporteur croit devoir rappeler ici l'ancien concordat
de la nation germanique de 1447 et le traité de Munster de 1648; puis,
il entre dans de longs détails sur la diète de Ratisbonne de 1803, qui
bouleversa par tant de sécularisations l'état politique et religieux
de l'Allemagne, et transféra le siège de Mayence à Ratisbonne;--sur
les conférences préparatoires de 1804, entre le nonce du pape et le
référendaire de l'empire;--sur l'acte de la confédération du Rhin, du
12 juillet 1806;--sur l'abdication de la couronne impériale
d'Allemagne par l'empereur François II (6 août 1806), qui opéra la
dissolution du corps germanique;--sur les prétentions diverses d'une
multitude de princes à l'égard du clergé catholique, de l'instruction
religieuse, des dispenses matrimoniales...;--sur l'asservissement des
évêques, des curés, des chanoines à tous ces princes;--et enfin sur
les difficultés nouvelles apportées à un arrangement quelconque par la
situation actuelle du Saint-Père.

Le conseil, ne voit depuis l'abdication de l'empereur François II, que
le protecteur de la confédération du Rhin (Napoléon), qui puisse,
d'accord avec le Souverain Pontife, remédier à ces maux, et il se
borne à faire des voeux.

Il faut convenir qu'il y avait bien de la mauvaise grâce et surtout
bien de la mauvaise foi de la part de l'empereur Napoléon, à imputer,
dans ce moment-là, les troubles religieux de l'Allemagne à l'abandon
dans lequel le pape laissait depuis dix ans l'Église d'Allemagne, et
la raison du conseil sur ce point est bien faible et bien
insignifiante.

DEUXIÈME QUESTION.--Est-il indispensable de faire une nouvelle
circonscription d'évêchés en Toscane et dans d'autres parties de
l'empire? Si le pape refuse de coopérer à ces arrangements, quelle
marche Sa Majesté devrait-elle suivre pour les régulariser?

_Réponse._--Le conseil pense que les églises de Toscane ne sont pas en
souffrance comme celles d'Allemagne; qu'elles sont régulièrement
organisées et administrées; qu'ainsi une nouvelle circonscription,
bien qu'utile, n'a rien d'urgent. _Tout porte à croire_, ajoute-t-il,
_que lorsque le pape sera entouré de ses conseils, Sa Sainteté y
donnera une attention active et soutenue_. Enfin le conseil croit que
Sa Majesté peut suspendre les améliorations qu'elle projette pour les
églises de la Toscane, jusqu'à ce que les affaires générales de
l'Église soient terminées, puisque la loi de la nécessité n'est pas
ici applicable.

TROISIÈME QUESTION.--La bulle d'excommunication du 10 juin 1809 étant
contraire à la charité chrétienne ainsi qu'à l'indépendance et à
l'honneur du trône, quel parti prendre pour que, dans des temps de
trouble et de calamité, les papes ne se portent pas à de tels excès de
pouvoir?

_Réponse._--Le conseil cite d'abord l'extrait de cette bulle qui
déclare que les _auteurs, fauteurs, conseillers et exécuteurs des
attentats_ (c'est-à-dire l'invasion de Rome et des provinces de
l'État romain, ainsi que les autres persécutions), _en vertu du livre
XXII, chapitre XIe qu'il rappelle, ont encouru l'excommunication
prononcée par le concile de Trente, et le Saint-Père les excommunie et
les anathématise de nouveau, sans toutefois nommer personne
spécialement. Sa Sainteté défend même d'attenter aux droits et
prérogatives des personnes comprises dans cette catégorie._

Le conseil dit ensuite: _Que les bulles de Boniface VIII contre
Philippe le Bel, de Jules II contre Louis XII, de Sixte-Quint contre
Henri IV, n'ont jamais eu de force ni d'effet en France, parce que les
évêques de France ont refusé de les admettre et de les publier. Par la
même raison, la bulle_ IN COENA DOMINI, _si longtemps publiée à Rome, a
toujours été regardée en France comme non avenue._

_Si la bulle du 10 juin 1809 eût été adressée aux évêques de France_,
le conseil pense _qu'ils l'eussent déclarée contraire à la discipline
de l'Église gallicane, à l'autorité du souverain, et capable, contre
l'intention du pape, de troubler la tranquillité publique_.

Il rappelle que _Grégoire XIV, successeur de Sixte-Quint, lança en
1591, des lettres_ MONITORIALES _contre Henri IV, et que les évêques
assemblés à Chartres déclarèrent que les censures et excommunications
portées par lesdites lettres étaient nulles, tant en la forme qu'en la
matière, et qu'elles ne pouvaient lier ni obliger la conscience_...

Le conseil se borne donc à déclarer: _Qu'il ne doute pas que le
concile national, si on l'assemble, rappelant les vrais principes à
cet égard, et l'esprit de l'Église, dans l'application des censures,
n'en déclare aussi la nullité, et n'interjette appel, tant de cette
bulle que de toutes bulles semblables, au concile général, ou au
pape mieux informé, comme cela a toujours eu lieu dans l'Église_.

Le conseil aurait pu ajouter que les lettres monitoriales contre le
roi Henri IV avaient été condamnées au feu par les parlements séant à
Tours et à Châlons.

Quant à Henri IV lui-même, alors roi de Navarre, excommunié par
Sixte-Quint en 1588, on sait que, suivant son caractère, il fit
afficher son acte d'appel au Vatican, et que le pape ne l'en estima
que davantage.

Le conseil ecclésiastique conclut, dans sa réponse générale, en citant
le premier article de la déclaration du clergé de France en 1682[52].

  [52] Cet article disait en substance que Dieu n'avait donné ni à
  saint Pierre, ni à ses successeurs, aucune puissance directe ou
  indirecte sur les choses temporelles.

C'est par la remise de ces réponses, le 11 janvier 1810, que le
conseil termina ses travaux qui avaient commencé le 16 novembre 1809.

J'oubliais de dire que le travail du conseil sur la première série de
questions est attribué à l'évêque de Trêves; celui sur la seconde
série, à l'évêque de Nantes, et celui sur la troisième, à l'archevêque
de Tours. On assure que le Père Fontana ne parut qu'aux premières
séances, et que M. Émery fut très peu exact aux séances, et ne signa
point les réponses de la commission, alléguant qu'il ne lui convenait
pas de mettre sa signature à côté de celles de cardinaux et d'évêques.


RÉFLEXIONS SUR CE CONSEIL ECCLÉSIASTIQUE.

Je conçois tous les ménagements que les membres de ce conseil ont dû
avoir pour l'empereur, dans la crainte de l'irriter et de le pousser
à des mesures plus violentes encore, c'est-à-dire à une rupture
complète avec le pape, qui eût ramené le schisme dans l'Église de
France. Mais je ne puis concevoir comment ils n'ont pas essayé avec
plus de persistance de le convaincre, que, pour être en droit
d'imputer les torts au pape, il fallait, du moins, lui accorder le
genre de liberté qu'il jugerait lui-même nécessaire pour donner des
bulles, et lui demander, en conséquence, ce qu'il estimait
indispensable pour cela. Le pape n'aurait pas osé dire qu'il lui
fallait avant tout Rome et le patrimoine de saint Pierre; cela eût été
trop évidemment faux, quelque naturel qu'il fût qu'il désirât
ardemment cette restitution, et qu'il ne cessât de protester contre la
violence qui lui avait ravi ses États. Il se serait réduit sans doute,
à demander un certain nombre de cardinaux, son secrétaire, ses
papiers... S'il eût demandé plus, ou que, ayant obtenu les objets de
sa première demande, il eût continué à refuser les bulles, alors les
réponses du conseil que nous venons d'analyser, eussent offert au
public l'expression d'opinions justes et convenables; mais, tant que
ce point indispensable n'était point accordé, presser le pape (dans la
situation où il se trouvait) par des arguments qui n'auraient eu de
valeur que dans le cas où il eût été démontré que son refus était de
la mauvaise volonté, c'était grandement affaiblir des raisons, fort
bonnes dans une autre supposition, mais qui, hors de là, devaient ne
paraître que des sophismes mêlés d'un peu de mauvaise foi et même de
déloyauté.

Avant la réunion et les délibérations du conseil ecclésiastique,
l'empereur avait fait quelques démarches vers le pape pour vaincre sa
répugnance à donner les bulles. Il lui avait fait dire par le cardinal
Caprara, dans une lettre que ce cardinal (lequel n'était plus légat,
mais qui, pourtant, se trouvait à Paris) écrivit au pape à Savone, le
20 juillet 1809, que l'empereur consentait à ce que son nom, de lui
empereur, et même son droit de nomination, ne fussent pas mentionnés
dans les bulles qui seraient alors délivrées sur la simple demande du
conseil d'État ou du ministre des cultes. A quoi le pape répondit, le
26 août, que ce conseil d'État ou ce ministre étant les organes de
l'empereur, ce serait reconnaître également dans l'empereur le droit
de nomination et la faculté de l'exercer, ce qu'il ne voulait pas.

Et pourquoi ne voulait-il pas reconnaître ce droit? Était-ce donc à
cause de l'excommunication? Alors, c'était montrer une humeur peu
raisonnée et commencer à se donner un tort. Pourquoi aussi l'empereur
avait-il fait ce sacrifice? N'aurait-il pas mieux valu qu'il n'en fît
aucun, et qu'il essayât de l'effet que produirait sur le Saint-Père,
la liberté suffisante qu'il lui accorderait?

L'année 1810, loin d'apporter quelques adoucissements à la situation
du pape, et de lui valoir, d'après les voeux et les prières du conseil
ecclésiastique, un peu plus de liberté, aggrava, au contraire, cette
situation, et rendit sa captivité plus dure.

En effet, le 17 février 1810, parut le sénatus-consulte prononçant la
réunion des États romains à l'empire français, l'indépendance du trône
impérial de toute autorité sur la terre, et annulant l'existence
temporelle des papes. Ce sénatus-consulte assurait une pension au
pape, mais il statuait aussi que le pape prêterait serment de ne rien
faire en opposition aux quatre articles de 1682.--Le même jour, autre
sénatus-consulte qui décerne au fils aîné de l'empereur le titre de
roi de Rome, et statue que l'empereur sera sacré une seconde fois à
Rome[53].

  [53] En outre de ces dispositions le sénatus-consulte du 17 février
  1810, décidait:

  Que le territoire pontifical formerait deux départements; celui de
  Rome et celui de Trasimène.

  Qu'un prince du sang ou un grand dignitaire tiendrait à Rome la
  cour impériale.

  Que toute souveraineté étrangère était incompatible avec l'exercice
  de toute autorité spirituelle dans l'intérieur de la France.

  Qu'il serait préparé pour le souverain pontife des palais dans les
  différents lieux de l'empire où il voudrait résider; qu'il en
  aurait nécessairement un à Paris et un à Rome.

  Que deux millions de revenu en biens ruraux seraient assignés à Sa
  Sainteté.

  Que l'État pourvoirait aux dépenses du sacré collège et de la
  propagande.

Toutes ces dispositions étaient hostiles et provocantes. On
n'accordait pas même au pape le droit et la liberté de s'en plaindre.
Comment se serait-il cru assez de liberté pour le reste? Ordonner par
un sénatus-consulte un serment au pape captif, et un serment de ne
rien faire contre les quatre articles de 1682, étaient deux points
irritants au suprême degré, et très évidemment inadmissibles, surtout
lorsqu'ils étaient imposés avec une telle hauteur. Le pape dut s'en
consoler au reste, presque s'en réjouir, en voyant qu'on faisait
dépendre de la prestation d'un tel serment la pension injurieuse qu'on
lui offrait, et c'est là ce qui lui fournit la réponse si noblement
apostolique: _qu'il n'avait nul besoin de cette pension, et qu'il
vivrait de la charité des fidèles_.

Il faut tout dire. Malgré son état de captivité à Savone, le
Saint-Père avait cependant répondu en 1809 à chacune des lettres
des dix-neuf évêques qui lui avaient demandé des _pouvoirs
extraordinaires_ pour des dispenses de mariage, et les leur avait
accordés.--Le 5 novembre 1810, il publia, autant du moins qu'il le
put, son bref contre le cardinal Maury et le lui adressa en réponse à
la communication que le cardinal lui avait faite de sa nomination à
l'archevêché de Paris. Le cardinal, en attendant ses bulles
d'institution, avait pris l'administration du diocèse, qui lui avait
été déférée par le chapitre métropolitain. Le pape, dans son bref, lui
reproche d'avoir abandonné la sainte cause qu'il avait si bien
défendue autrefois; de violer son serment, d'avoir quitté son siège de
Montefiascone, et de prendre l'administration d'un siège dont il ne
pouvait être chargé. Il lui _ordonne_ d'y renoncer et de ne pas le
forcer à procéder contre lui, conformément aux canons de l'Église. Ce
bref fit grand bruit et valut, le 1er janvier 1811, une éclatante
disgrâce à l'abbé d'Astros qui l'avait fait connaître, et bientôt
après à son parent, M. Portalis, le fils, qui l'avait connu par
lui[54].

  [54] Ce bref avait été adressé par Pie VII à l'abbé d'Astros,
  vicaire général du diocèse de Paris. Celui-ci l'avait communiqué à
  son cousin, le comte Portalis, alors conseiller d'État et directeur
  de la librairie. Tous deux gardèrent le secret, et le bref fut
  publié. Napoléon eut connaissance de ces faits: sa colère fut
  violente. Dans la séance du conseil d'État du 4 janvier 1811, il
  reprocha avec véhémence, sa conduite au comte Portalis, le destitua
  de toutes ses fonctions et l'exila en Provence. Quant à l'abbé
  d'Astros, il fut arrêté et enfermé à Vincennes d'où il ne sortit
  qu'en 1814.

Il y avait bien ici, ou ne peut le nier, un peu de contradiction de la
part du pape: pouvoir lancer un bref contre le cardinal Maury; pouvoir
répondre dix-neuf lettres aux évêques qui lui demandaient des pouvoirs
et les leur accorder;--et ne pouvoir, faute de liberté, délivrer des
bulles d'institution et faire cesser la longue viduité de tant
d'églises; cela était-il bien conséquent?

Deux autres faits viennent à l'appui de cette réflexion.

Vers la fin de l'année 1810, l'empereur avait nommé à l'archevêché de
Florence M. d'Osmond[55], évêque de Nancy, Pie VII, par un bref du 2
décembre 1810, déclara que cet évêque ne pouvait administrer le
diocèse de Florence, s'appuyant pour cela sur les décisions du second
concile de Lyon et sur celles du concile de Trente, qui n'étaient
vraiment pas applicables à cette circonstance. Le chapitre de Florence
déféra à l'ordre du pape, ce qui causa des troubles dans la ville.
Napoléon avait aussi nommé à l'évêché d'Asti un M. Dejean[56]: autre
bref du pape pour que le chapitre ne lui confiât pas le pouvoir
d'administrer. L'empereur, qui voyait que le pape voulait mettre des
bornes à son pouvoir, se porta alors à de grandes violences.

  [55] Antoine baron d'Osmond, né en 1754, fut d'abord vicaire
  général de M. de Brienne, archevêque de Toulouse. Le 1er mai 1785,
  il fut sacré évêque de Comminge pour succéder à son oncle. Il
  émigra à la Révolution, se démit de son siège en 1801, et fut nommé
  en 1802 évêque de Nancy. En 1810, il fut nommé archevêque de
  Florence, mais le pape refusa de l'instituer, et il dut, en 1814,
  reprendre son siège de Nancy. Il mourut en 1823.

  [56] François-André, baron Dejean, né à Castelnaudary en 1748,
  nommé évêque d'Asti le 9 février 1809.

Le 1er janvier 1811 éclata l'affaire de l'abbé d'Astros, qu'on arrêta
en sortant des Tuileries. Le chapitre de Paris lui retira ses pouvoirs
de grand vicaire et profita de cette occasion pour écrire,
probablement sous les yeux du cardinal Maury, une lettre à l'empereur,
dans laquelle il établissait le droit du chapitre de pourvoir au siège
vacant, et de déférer à un évêque nommé tous les pouvoirs
capitulaires, c'est-à-dire toute la juridiction épiscopale, se fondant
sur ce qui avait été pratiqué du temps de Louis XIV, et même par le
conseil de Bossuet, disait-il, mais sans pouvoir le prouver. Cette
lettre, envoyée dans tous les diocèses de France et d'Italie, attira
une multitude d'adhésions d'évêques et de chapitres, soit d'Italie,
soit de France, qui confirmaient cette doctrine.

La publication de tous les brefs dont je viens de parler, loin de
disposer l'empereur à accorder plus de liberté au pape, lui persuada
qu'il en avait beaucoup trop, puisqu'il en abusait ainsi. On donna
l'ordre, le 7 janvier 1811, de faire dans son appartement une
perquisition rigoureuse; on fouilla tout, jusqu'à son secrétaire; et
ses papiers et ceux des personnes de sa maison furent envoyés à Paris.
On y trouva, dit-on, un bref qui conférait des pouvoirs
extraordinaires au cardinal di Pietro[57]. Alors on lui retira plumes,
encre, papier. On lui enleva son maître de chambre, le prélat Doria,
son confesseur. On le priva de toute communication avec l'évêque de
Savone[58]; on saisit les papiers de ce dernier et on l'emmena
lui-même à Paris. Il resta au pape quelques domestiques auxquels on
assigna environ quarante sous par jour pour leur dépense. C'est au
moment où l'empereur se livrait à de si indignes violences et où le
pape continuait ses nobles et légitimes refus, pour ce qui le
concernait personnellement, que Napoléon se décida à nommer une
seconde commission ecclésiastique.

  [57] Michel di Pietro, né en 1747, avait été institué délégué
  apostolique par Pie VI en 1798, lorsque ce pape fut enlevé de Rome
  par ordre du directoire. Pie VII le nomma patriarche de Jérusalem,
  cardinal et préfet de la propagande. Il dut venir à Paris après
  l'arrestation du pape, et fut exilé à Semur pour avoir refusé
  d'assister au mariage de Napoléon et de Marie-Louise. Il revint à
  Rome en 1815, devint grand pénitencier et évêque d'Albano. Il
  mourut en 1821.

  [58] Voici l'ordre signifié au Saint-Père par le préfet du
  département de Montenotte, M. de Chabrol, d'après les instructions
  envoyées de Paris:

  «Le soussigné, d'après les ordres émanés de son souverain, Sa
  Majesté impériale et royale Napoléon, empereur des Français, roi
  d'Italie, protecteur de la confédération du Rhin... est chargé de
  notifier au pape Pie VII que défense lui est faite de communiquer
  avec aucune Église de l'empire, ni avec aucun sujet de l'empereur,
  sous peine de désobéissance de sa part et de la leur; qu'il cesse
  d'être l'organe de l'Église, celui qui prêche la rébellion et dont
  l'âme est toute de fiel; que puisque rien ne peut le rendre sage,
  il verra que Sa Majesté est assez puissante pour faire ce qu'ont
  fait ses prédécesseurs et déposer un pape.» (_Note de M. de
  Bacourt._)

  Savone, le 14 janvier 1811.


SECONDE COMMISSION ECCLÉSIASTIQUE.

Formée en janvier 1811, cette commission termina ses travaux à la fin
de mars. Elle était composée des cardinaux Fesch, Maury et Caselli,
des archevêques de Tours des évêques de Gand[59], d'Évreux, de Nantes,
de Trêves, et de M. l'abbé Émery.

  [59] Maurice-Madeleine de Broglie (1766-1821), troisième fils du
  maréchal de Broglie, évêque d'Acqui et aumônier de l'empereur en
  1805, promu à l'évêché de Gand en 1809; fut emprisonné à la suite
  de sa résistance aux volontés de l'empereur au concile de 1811. De
  retour dans son siège épiscopal en 1814, il protesta contre
  diverses dispositions de la constitution du royaume des Pays-Bas,
  fut de nouveau exilé et vint mourir à Paris.

Elle eut à répondre à ces deux seules questions:

PREMIÈRE QUESTION.--Toute communication entre le pape et les sujets de
l'empereur, étant interrompue quant à présent, à qui faut-il
s'adresser pour obtenir les dispenses qu'accorderait le Saint-Siège?

DEUXIÈME QUESTION.--Quand le pape refuse persévéramment d'accorder des
bulles aux évêques nommés par l'empereur pour remplir les sièges
vacants, quel est le moyen légitime de leur donner l'institution
canonique?

La commission, avant de répondre, exprime d'abord _sa profonde douleur
de ce que toute communication entre le pape et les sujets de
l'empereur vient d'être rompue. Elle ne peut prévoir que des jours de
deuil et d'affliction pour l'Église, si ces communications demeurent
longtemps suspendues_...

C'était bien demander la liberté du pape. Mais la commission ne devait
pas se borner à placer cela dans un préambule. Il fallait y revenir
dans ses réponses, sans quoi elle avait l'air de vouloir se
débarrasser dans une formule préliminaire, et pour ne plus y revenir,
de cette objection qui accusait si fortement Napoléon.

_Réponse à la première question_:

La commission pense que la réserve des dispenses, attribuée au pape
dans l'Église d'Occident, est très convenable, en ce qui regarde la
discipline générale du clergé, et que, sans examiner si elle est de
droit divin ou non, elle est devenue, par cette convenance même et par
un très long exercice, une sorte de droit commun dont on ne doit pas
chercher à s'affranchir. Mais, quant à la réserve des dispenses
relatives aux besoins journaliers des fidèles, laquelle se trouve
aussi, avec beaucoup de diversités locales, dans ses attributions, la
commission affirme, sans hésitation, _que les évêques ont, chacun dans
leur diocèse, entièrement en eux le pouvoir d'accorder aux fidèles les
dispenses et absolutions qui s'y rapportent; que ce pouvoir ne leur a
jamais été retiré par aucune loi, ni par aucun canon, qu'il est même
inaliénable et qu'ils rentrent tout naturellement dans ce pouvoir,
lorsque surtout, comme dans les circonstances présentes, le recours au
pape est à peu près impossible_.

_Réponse à la seconde question_:

Cette question avait déjà été proposée à la commission de 1809 et
résolue tant bien que mal par elle. Elle avait été reproduite ici
parce que l'empereur présumait qu'il aurait une réponse plus précise
et plus rapprochée de la note qu'il avait, dans le temps, dictée à M.
Duvoisin, et il ne se trompa pas complètement. La nouvelle commission
reconnut d'abord que le pape avait continué à refuser les bulles, sans
alléguer aucune raison canonique de son refus, malgré les
supplications des églises de France, et quoique les suites de ce refus
devinssent tous les jours plus funestes. Elle rappela ce qui s'était
passé à l'époque d'Innocent XI, lorsque des évêques nommés par le roi
purent gouverner leur diocèse, en vertu des pouvoirs à eux donnés par
le chapitre. Fléchier, ainsi nommé successivement à Lavaur et à Nîmes,
en était une preuve. Elle dit ensuite que le pape, en proscrivant par
ses brefs adressés aux chapitres de Paris, de Florence et d'Asti, ce
mode adopté de tout temps par l'Église de France, attaquait
ouvertement l'antique discipline de cette Église, ce qui _était une
triste preuve des préventions qu'on lui avait inspirées_.

_Mais l'empereur_, ajoute la commission, _ne veut plus faire dépendre
l'existence de l'épiscopat en France de l'institution canonique du
pape qui serait ainsi maître de l'épiscopat. Que faut-il faire?_ Elle
convient _que le concordat donne un avantage très marqué au pape sur
le souverain de France. Le prince perd le droit de nommer, si, dans un
temps fixé, il ne présente pas un sujet capable_. (La commission se
trompe ici tout à fait: il ne le perd jamais; sans quoi, à qui ce
droit passerait-il?) _Pour qu'il y eût égalité, il eût fallu que, de
son côté, le pape fût obligé à donner l'institution ou à produire un
motif canonique de refus, dans un temps déterminé; faute de quoi il
perdrait son droit d'institution, qui serait dévolu à qui de droit.
Cette clause manque au concordat. Il faut qu'elle y soit ajoutée;
c'est la mesure la plus simple et la plus conforme aux principes.
L'empereur_, disait la commission, _est en droit de l'exiger et le
pape doit y consentir_ (ce sont les termes employés), _et s'il n'y
consentait pas, il justifierait, aux yeux de l'Europe, l'entière
abolition du concordat et le recours à un autre moyen de conférer
l'institution canonique_. (La commission de 1809 n'avait pas eu un
langage aussi fort et aussi décidé.)

_Quelque juste que fût, dans la circonstance, l'entière abolition du
concordat, quelque légitime que pût être le rétablissement de la
pragmatique sanction ou de tout autre moyen d'institution canonique_,
la commission cependant pensait _qu'il fallait y préparer les esprits,
et avoir convaincu les fidèles qu'il ne restait pas d'autre ressource
pour donner des évêques à l'Église de France, sans quoi la position
des évêques institués d'après les formes nouvelles serait
insoutenable. Ce changement serait assimilé à la constitution civile
du clergé de 1791, et produirait les mêmes troubles. Les personnes
éclairées verraient bien que cela ne peut se comparer à une
constitution ecclésiastique décrétée par une autorité purement
politique, contre le sentiment du Souverain Pontife et de presque tous
les évêques de France. Mais les autres ne saisiraient peut-être pas
bien la différence, en voyant surtout l'autorité de l'empereur
déployée avec tant de vivacité contre le Saint-Père. Les uns, dans
cette lutte, prendraient parti pour le pape contre l'épiscopat
français; les autres se sépareraient peut-être beaucoup trop du
Saint-Siège, et le schisme renaîtrait avec tous ses désordres. A peine
a-t-on pu l'éteindre en 1801, au moyen de l'accord parfait du pape et
de la majorité des évêques. Combien n'aurait-on pas à craindre de le
voir renaître, si les évêques se déclaraient séparés du pape, par une
aussi grave décision?_

_Cependant, on ne peut laisser les choses dans l'état où elles sont. La
juridiction accordée par les chapitres aux évêques nommés, outre
qu'elle a aussi le grave inconvénient d'être improuvée par le pape, ne
fait pas réellement jouir les diocèses d'un épiscopat complet. Si donc
le pape persiste dans ses refus sans motif canonique, nous nous
permettons d'exprimer le désir que l'on déclare à Sa Sainteté, ou que
le concordat déjà rompu par son propre fait sera publiquement aboli
par l'empereur, ou qu'il ne sera conservé qu'à la faveur d'une clause
propre à rassurer contre des refus arbitraires, qui rendent illusoires
les droits que le concordat assure à nos souverains_.

Ce sont les propres paroles de la commission. Elle reconnaissait donc
que l'empereur avait, dans le cas présent, le droit de déclarer le
concordat aboli, sauf à chercher ensuite le moyen de s'en passer. Or,
quel autre moyen, si ce n'est, ou de recourir à l'ancien droit, selon
lequel les bulles n'étaient pas nécessaires (je me sers de
l'expression de la commission), ou bien, si l'on veut que le concordat
subsiste, d'y ajouter une clause par laquelle le droit du pape
passerait à une autre autorité, faute d'être exercé par lui dans un
temps déterminé?

Ainsi, ou le concordat sera déclaré aboli, ou il sera modifié à l'aide
d'une clause acceptée par les deux parties et qui préviendra tous les
abus.

Je remarque que, dans le premier cas, on pourra se passer tout à fait
du pape, s'il persiste dans ses refus, et chercher ailleurs une autre
institution canonique que la sienne. Cela est dit par la commission,
sans la moindre restriction. L'empereur ne veut plus, dit-elle, que
l'épiscopat en France, dépende de l'institution du pape qui serait
ainsi maître de l'épiscopat; et elle trouve qu'il a raison, qu'il est
juste, et tout à fait au pouvoir de l'empereur, que le concordat soit
aboli par lui, puisqu'il n'est plus exécuté que par lui. Elle
n'éprouve à cet égard ni doute ni regret. C'est la faute du pape. Or,
de là à dire que l'empereur pourra ensuite faire le reste, ou aviser
aux moyens pour que le reste soit fait, à peine y avait il un pas.
Car, si l'empereur n'avait pas en lui ou à sa disposition tout ce
qu'il fallait pour obtenir qu'une autre institution fût substituée à
celle du pape, à quoi lui eût servi le pouvoir d'abolir le concordat?
Il pouvait se trouver alors en l'abolissant, tout aussi embarrassé
qu'auparavant.

Cependant la commission ne voulut pas faire ce pas. Elle pensa, elle
déclara que, par principe comme par prudence, il fallait un concile
national qui déterminât où l'on trouverait cette institution. Mais
était-elle sûre que ce concile, travaillé par l'esprit de parti et par
des intrigues de tout genre, se croirait un pareil droit?
N'embarrasserait-il pas ou n'inquiéterait-il pas par de nouvelles
difficultés, au lieu de résoudre celles qu'il était appelé à régler?
Consentirait-il à chercher d'où l'institution des évêques pourrait
sortir? La solution pourrait donc rester incomplète.

La commission n'aurait pas dû tant appuyer sur le droit de l'empereur
d'abolir le concordat et le proclamer si haut, puisqu'elle ne pouvait
pas lui faire connaître un moyen certain de s'en passer. Ce fut un
tort, je crois, et une inconséquence de la part de la commission.

J'ai pensé quelquefois que si l'empereur avait fait l'évêque de Nantes
ministre des cultes, on aurait pu se passer d'un concile qui ne devait
qu'embarrasser les questions. Cet évêque si honnête, si habile et si
versé dans les connaissances théologiques, en agissant avec la triple
autorité de ministre, d'évêque et de théologien consommé, sur chacun
des autres évêques séparément, aurait bien plus aisément obtenu leur
consentement pour qu'on substituât une autre institution canonique à
celle du pape, qu'il ne le pouvait dans un concile où chaque évêque
redoutait l'idée de paraître gouverné par plus habile que lui, et où
les évêques réunis n'avaient plus de l'empereur la crainte que chacun
d'eux avait en particulier. Peut-être même que le pape lui-même les
aurait tous tirés d'embarras en donnant cette fois l'institution, de
peur d'en perdre le droit pour l'avenir.

Quoi qu'il en soit de cette idée purement conjecturale, il y avait une
autre supposition à discuter que celle de l'abolition du concordat:
c'était celle de sa modification par une clause qui préviendrait pour
jamais les abus, et c'est là incontestablement tout ce qu'il y avait
de plus désirable et le parti le plus conforme aux principes, et le
plus propre, de l'aveu même de la commission, à rassurer toutes les
consciences.

Par là, en effet, les deux parties contractantes pouvaient se trouver
satisfaites. Le pape, dans la rédaction, eût concilié cette clause
avec ses sentiments même les plus ultramontains, en y déclarant
qu'après les trois ou six mois expirés, il autorisait le métropolitain
à le remplacer; et alors, c'était toujours lui qui était la source du
pouvoir; il ne compromettait rien aux yeux des plus difficiles; et je
pense que cette concession de la part du pape pouvait être obtenue si
la négociation eût été bien conduite. L'empereur, de son côté, avait
tout ce qu'il voulait, plus même qu'il n'avait voulu jusqu'alors; car,
jusqu'à l'existence des commissions, il avait voulu seulement que le
pape donnât des bulles aux évêques nommés par lui, consentant même à
ce que le pape n'insérât pas le nom de l'empereur dans ces bulles; et
en suivant la marche que je propose, Napoléon obtenait de plus, du
consentement même du pape, qu'elles ne pussent plus être refusées à
l'avenir par lui, sans qu'à l'instant même l'institution qu'il ne
donnait pas fût remplacée par un acte non moins canonique. Obtenir
cela du pape, sans lui rendre Rome et ses autres États, eût été un
triomphe digne de la fabuleuse destinée de Napoléon, un triomphe mille
fois plus important dans ses suites que s'il l'eût obtenu d'un concile
national.

Mais d'abord la commission avait mis elle-même un obstacle à ce qu'on
pût obtenir une pareille clause. Tout en convenant que cette clause
dans le concordat était ce qu'il y avait le plus à désirer, elle était
toujours revenue à dire qu'il fallait soit pour l'obtenir, soit pour
s'en passer, recourir à un concile national, ce qui ne mettait pas fin
à la difficulté: car, si le concile éludait la question au lieu de la
résoudre, que devenait-on? Cependant, elle n'avait garde non plus
d'écarter l'idée d'une négociation; seulement, elle ne se croyait pas
en mesure d'en faire la proposition, n'ayant pas été assemblée pour
cela.

Ce qu'elle ne se crut pas en droit de faire, l'évêque de Nantes se
risqua à le tenter directement auprès de l'empereur, dans la crainte
sans doute de l'éclat que ferait la rupture subite du concordat qui,
dans les _considérants_ du décret, aurait sûrement été accompagnée
d'expressions dures, et par conséquent d'un effet très fâcheux. M.
Duvoisin était peut-être aussi inquiet des dispositions qu'apporterait
le concile ou de celles que l'on parviendrait à lui suggérer une fois
qu'il serait assemblé. Il pressa donc beaucoup l'empereur, non
d'envoyer, si cela ne lui convenait pas, auprès du pape trois membres
de la commission pour tenter un dernier effort sur lui, mais de les
autoriser à y aller.

L'empereur résista très longtemps, et M. Duvoisin eut beaucoup de
peine à le faire céder. Dans un moment d'emportement, il avait résolu
de déchirer le concordat; il l'avait dit, et il ne voulait pas se
dédire; je crois en vérité qu'il y mettait une sorte de gloire;
cependant, elle n'était pas grande. Il voulait, disait-il, en finir
avec le pape. Une fois le concordat déchiré, il croyait que tout était
fini. Il avait consenti, il est vrai, à convoquer un concile; mais il
pensait qu'il n'avait rien à en redouter: «Le concordat détruit par un
décret, disait-il, il faudrait bien que le concile, s'il voulait
conserver l'épiscopat, proposât nécessairement un autre mode
d'institution pour les évêques, puisqu'on ne pourrait plus recourir à
un concordat qui n'existerait plus.»

M. Duvoisin ne se tint pas pour battu et insista toujours; enfin, il
décida l'empereur qui, tout en cédant, y mit tant de mauvaise grâce
qu'il s'occupa plus dans les instructions qu'il donna, d'accroître les
difficultés que de les aplanir; il avait l'air de chercher lui-même à
faire manquer la négociation. On sut que les instructions données par
le ministre des cultes[60] aux évêques partant pour Savone, avaient
été dictées par l'empereur. Le ministre, qui ne voulait pas en avoir
la responsabilité, l'avait dit à plusieurs membres influents du
clergé.

  [60] Le ministre des cultes était alors Jean Bigot de Préameneu. Né
  en 1747, il avait été avocat au parlement. En 1791, il fut élu
  député de Paris à l'Assemblée législative, et en devint le
  président en 1792. Il vécut dans la retraite durant toute la
  Révolution. Après le 18 brumaire, il fut nommé commissaire du
  gouvernement près le tribunal de cassation, puis conseiller d'État
  et président de la section de législation. Il fit partie de la
  commission chargée de rédiger le code civil. En 1808, il devint
  ministre des cultes. La première restauration lui conserva ses
  fonctions et le créa pair de France. Il vécut dans la retraite sous
  la deuxième, et mourut en 1825.

Au lieu de se borner au point important qu'il eût été si heureux
d'obtenir, Napoléon voulait que les évêques fissent au Saint-Père les
demandes les moins admissibles, comme si c'était une faveur qu'il
accordait au pape de maintenir le concordat, même avec la clause qu'il
demandait. Il voulut qu'on lui annonçât avant tout la convocation d'un
concile national pour le 9 juin suivant, et qu'on lui exposât les
mesures que l'Église de France pourrait être entraînée à prendre
d'après les exemples anciens. Il ne consentirait à revenir au
concordat, disait-il, dans ces mêmes instructions, qu'autant que le
pape instituerait d'abord tous les évêques nommés et s'engagerait
ensuite à ce qu'à l'avenir l'institution des évêques fût faite par le
métropolitain, dans les cas où il ne les aurait pas lui-même institués
dans le terme de trois mois. Il voulait, et _c'était un ordre formel_
que les négociateurs déclarassent au pape qu'il ne rentrerait jamais
dans Rome comme souverain; mais qu'il lui serait permis d'y retourner
comme simple chef de la religion catholique, s'il consentait à
ratifier les modifications demandées pour le concordat. Dans le cas
où il ne lui conviendrait plus d'aller à Rome, il pourrait résider à
Avignon, où il jouirait des honneurs souverains, et où il aurait la
liberté d'administrer les intérêts spirituels des autres pays de la
chrétienté. Enfin, on devait lui offrir deux millions, le tout sous la
condition qu'il promettrait de ne rien faire dans l'empire de
contraire aux quatre articles de 1682.

Les trois négociateurs députés étaient: l'archevêque de Tours,
l'évêque de Nantes et l'évêque de Trêves auxquels était adjoint
l'évêque de Faenza[61], nommé patriarche de Venise, qui devait de son
côté, se rendre à Savone. Ils étaient députés par tous les cardinaux
et évêques qui se trouvaient alors à Paris et qui leur avaient remis
dix-sept lettres adressées au Saint-Père; la plus étendue et la plus
pressante était celle du cardinal Fesch.

  [61] M. Buonsignori, nommé par Napoléon, patriarche archevêque de
  Venise.

C'est munis de ces lettres, d'instructions et de pouvoirs pour
conclure et signer un arrangement, que les trois députés partirent, à
la fin d'avril 1811. Ils arrivèrent à Savone le 9 mai. Il leur avait
été fortement recommandé d'être de retour à Paris huit jours avant
l'ouverture du concile, c'est-à-dire avant le 9 juin; ils quittèrent,
en effet, Savone le 19 mai.

Ce que renfermaient les lettres qu'ils écrivirent de Savone au
ministre des cultes, au nombre de neuf, et celle plus détaillée qu'ils
lui écrivirent ensuite de Paris après leur retour, montre avec quelle
sagesse et quelle convenance ils conduisirent cette négociation, et
comment ils amenèrent le pape, en ne lui déguisant rien, à leur
témoigner chaque jour des dispositions plus douces, plus
conciliantes, et à le faire consentir enfin, avec quelques légères
modifications, aux demandes principales qu'ils étaient chargés de lui
soumettre, ou, si l'on veut, de lui imposer.

Il est à remarquer que le lendemain de leur arrivée, le pape, en les
voyant, montra d'abord quelque inquiétude qu'ils ne vinssent lui
annoncer que le futur concile allait se constituer juge de sa
conduite. On rejeta avec force cette idée, et on employa pour le
calmer les formes du plus grand respect. On prétendit, dans le temps,
que la crainte qu'il avait laissé percer alors, pouvait bien avoir eu
quelque influence sur ses bienveillantes dispositions. Il résista les
premiers jours sans aigreur, avec une extrême modération et même avec
quelques paroles d'affection pour l'empereur; mais ce qu'on lui
demandait était si important que cela exigeait qu'il en conférât avec
ses conseillers accoutumés, et il se plaignait d'en être privé. Les
trois négociateurs ne pouvaient pas les lui rendre, mais ils ne
négligeaient rien pour lui persuader qu'il n'en serait plus privé
lorsqu'il serait entré dans les idées conciliatrices et pacifiques
dont ils étaient près de lui les organes; ils ajoutaient que, pour ce
qui concernait les bulles, il n'était pas besoin de beaucoup de
délibérations ni de conseillers; qu'au fond, la demande était juste,
et qu'il devait voir clairement, combien il importait au bien des
fidèles, des diocèses et de la religion, qu'il accordât les bulles aux
évêques nommés; et à son propre intérêt, comme Souverain Pontife,
qu'il conservât, en adoptant la nouvelle clause dans le concordat, ce
lien si précieux avec l'épiscopat de France, qui allait se rompre, si
une fois le concordat était déclaré aboli.

Le pape faisait de nouvelles objections, mais chaque jour moins
fortes; il exprimait du regret, jamais l'apparence de la mauvaise
volonté. Les évêques ne se pressaient pas de lui parler de la
souveraineté de Rome, de peur de nuire à la négociation principale.
Ils crurent d'ailleurs s'apercevoir que le Saint-Père ne s'attendant
plus à recouvrer cette souveraineté, protesterait sans doute, toujours
sur ce point, puisqu'il n'avait pas le droit d'en faire le sacrifice,
mais qu'il s'engagerait probablement à ne pas retourner à Rome, plutôt
que de consentir à prêter le serment par lequel il en reconnaîtrait
l'empereur comme souverain; enfin, qu'il sentait bien que la privation
de cette souveraineté ne devait pas l'empêcher de gouverner l'Église,
aussitôt que ses conseillers lui auraient été rendus. Le pape était
donc résigné; c'était tout ce qu'il fallait aux députés négociateurs.

Il n'y eut pas de véritable discussion au sujet de la bulle
d'excommunication, sur laquelle cependant les évêques avaient eu
occasion d'exprimer leurs sentiments. Il leur avait paru que le
Saint-Père n'y tenait pas, et qu'il consentirait sans peine à la
regarder comme non avenue.

Le pape résista doucement, mais constamment, à faire la promesse de
regarder comme règle disciplinaire du clergé de France les quatre
articles de 1682. Il se montra très disposé en faveur du premier de
ces articles, qui reconnaît l'indépendance de la souveraineté
temporelle. Mais pourquoi, ajoutait-il, exiger de lui une déclaration
sur les trois autres articles? Il donnait sa parole d'honneur de ne
rien faire contre; on pouvait s'en rapporter à lui. Comment lui
demander ce qui n'a jamais été demandé à aucun pape, une promesse
signée à cet égard? Il s'agissait ici de part et d'autre, disait-il,
d'opinions libres. Bossuet, lui-même, ne demandait pas autre chose.
Il n'avait eu garde d'exposer les siennes aux théologiens d'Italie et
surtout au pape. Le Saint-Père revenait souvent à la bulle d'Alexandre
VIII (Ottoboni) successeur d'Innocent XI, qui loin de se relâcher de
l'inflexibilité de son prédécesseur, avait lancé une bulle contre la
déclaration de 1682, trois jours avant sa mort. Il convenait que cette
bulle n'avait pas eu de suites; il ne cherchait pas à la justifier,
mais, était-ce à lui à faire le procès de son prédécesseur et à le
condamner? Ne dirait-on pas en Italie, et dans tout le monde chrétien,
qu'il avait consenti à donner cette promesse par ennui de la
captivité? Sa mémoire serait flétrie par un tel soupçon. Ces questions
étaient d'ailleurs compliquées et difficiles; il n'en est point, sur
lesquelles il eût plus besoin de conseil...

Quant aux bulles, nous n'avons pu, écrivaient les trois évêques, après
sept ou huit entretiens, obtenir du pape que l'engagement de les
accorder aux évêques déjà nommés; il ne croit pas pouvoir décider
quelque chose pour l'avenir sans son conseil, et par conséquent,
consentir à la clause nouvelle, et si importante, qui serait insérée
dans le concordat. Nous épuisâmes sur ce point toutes les raisons et
les considérations possibles, et nous annonçâmes avec regret que nous
partirions le surlendemain. Ce départ si prompt parut l'affecter; il
nous fit exprimer le désir de nous revoir; nous nous rendîmes à ses
ordres, et il nous sembla qu'il ne tenait plus alors qu'à obtenir la
substitution du terme de six mois à celui de trois pour exercer son
droit d'instituer. Nous présumâmes que cela ne ferait pas une
véritable difficulté; nous lui exprimâmes donc toute notre confiance à
cet égard. Enfin, nous l'amenâmes, peu à peu, à agréer les articles
suivants, rédigés en quelque sorte sous sa dictée, et dont il voulut
garder une copie, comme un témoignage, dit-il, de ses propres
concessions, et de son ardent désir de rétablir la paix de l'Église.


ARTICLES CONSENTIS PAR LE PAPE.

«Sa Sainteté, prenant en considération les besoins et le voeu des
Églises de France et d'Italie qui lui ont été présentés par
l'archevêque de Tours et par les évêques de Nantes, de Trêves et de
Faenza, et voulant donner à ces Églises une nouvelle preuve de son
affection paternelle, a déclaré aux archevêque et évêques susdits:

»1º Qu'elle accorderait l'institution canonique aux sujets nommés
archevêques et évêques par Sa Majesté Impériale et Royale, dans la
forme convenue à l'époque des concordats de France et d'Italie.

»2º Sa Sainteté se prêtera à étendre les mêmes dispositions aux
Églises de la Toscane, de Parme et de Plaisance par un nouveau
concordat.

»3º Sa Sainteté consent qu'il soit inséré dans les concordats une
clause par laquelle elle s'engage à faire expédier des bulles
d'institution aux évêques nommés par Sa Majesté, dans un temps
déterminé, que Sa Sainteté estime ne pouvoir être moindre de six mois;
et, dans le cas où elle différerait plus de six mois pour d'autres
raisons que l'indignité personnelle des sujets, elle investit du
pouvoir de donner, en son nom, les bulles, après les six mois expirés,
le métropolitain de l'Église vacante, et, à son défaut, le plus ancien
évêque de la province.

»4º Sa Sainteté ne se détermine à ces concessions que dans l'espérance
que lui ont fait concevoir les entretiens qu'elle a eus avec les
évêques députés, qu'elles prépareraient les voies à des arrangements
qui rétabliront l'ordre et la paix de l'Église, et qui rendront au
Saint-Siège la liberté, l'indépendance et la dignité qui lui
conviennent.

»Savone, le 19 mai 1811.»

La déclaration qu'on obtenait ainsi du pape était une grande chose qui
fermait pour ainsi dire, à l'avenir, tout débat entre le gouvernement
français et la cour de Rome. Comment celle-ci pouvait-elle désormais
troubler l'ordre en France? L'institution canonique des évêques était
la seule arme par où le refus d'un pape et son inaction pussent
apporter du trouble; son action n'en apporterait jamais; car elle ne
pouvait se produire que par des brefs, des bulles... et la France se
maintiendrait toujours dans l'usage de ne pas en permettre la
publication, qu'elle ne les eût examinés et jugés comme ne renfermant
rien de contraire aux lois du pays. Toute volonté hostile d'un pape,
et même toute dissidence qui aurait déplu seraient par là paralysées.
Peu importait ce que le pape pensait des libertés gallicanes,
puisqu'il ne serait pas en son pouvoir d'en arrêter l'effet. Vouloir
lui faire signer d'avance quelque promesse à cet égard était donc tout
à fait inutile. Le pape lui-même l'avait dit; et, dès lors, ce n'était
qu'une tyrannie puérile qu'on exerçait sur lui. On avait la parole
d'honneur du Saint-Père; c'était bien quelque chose; c'était même
beaucoup plus qu'aucun pape n'avait jamais fait; et, ne l'eût-il pas
donnée, il n'en serait résulté aucun danger, ni même le plus léger
inconvénient.

J'oubliais de dire qu'il y avait un autre point sur lequel il avait
montré dans la conversation qu'il ne céderait jamais: c'était celui
par lequel l'empereur prétendait se réserver la nomination à tous les
évêchés d'Italie, en ne laissant au pape que _l'institution_.--Quoi,
disait-il avec émotion, pour récompenser des sujets, des cardinaux
même, qui auront servi avec zèle et talent, l'administration
pontificale, le pape ne pourrait pas nommer un seul évêque dans toute
la chrétienté, même dans les Églises qui, de temps immémorial,
faisaient partie du diocèse de Rome, et dont les titres se
trouveraient annulés par un simple concordat? Cela serait pourtant
_bien terrible_...C'était son expression, la seule de ce genre qui
lui soit échappée dans ses entretiens avec les évêques français.
Ceux-ci n'avaient rien à lui répliquer sur ce point, tant le voeu du
Saint-Père leur paraissait naturel.

Ils eurent occasion de lui parler des deux millions en biens ruraux,
fixés par le décret du 17 février 1810 pour l'entretien du pape. Pie
VII commença par un refus très absolu, se plaisant à leur répéter ce
qu'il avait dit dès le principe, qu'il voulait vivre de peu et des
secours que lui procurerait la charité des fidèles. Mais les évêques
combattirent cette résolution, toute noble qu'elle était, en lui
faisant observer qu'il ne pouvait pas priver ses successeurs des
avantages temporels accordés par l'empereur, des honneurs souverains,
des moyens de communiquer avec les princes catholiques; et aussi des
ressources nécessaires pour l'entretien du sacré collège, qui, par
l'effet du décret du 17 février 1810, restait à la charge du trésor
impérial.

Ces considérations parurent l'ébranler: il n'insista point, mais rien
ne fut décidé à cet égard.

Les évêques retournèrent en France, convaincus qu'avec sa liberté et
de bons conseils, le Saint-Père, si l'on ménageait sa délicatesse,
pourrait encore faire de nouvelles concessions sur plusieurs points
même assez importants. Mais ils avaient obtenu le principal.

Une telle négociation si bien commencée aurait dû amener la fin de
toutes les contestations.

Que fallait-il faire pour cela? Une seule chose, ce semble. Ne pas
laisser le concile s'ouvrir et l'ajourner à un mois. Pendant ce temps,
Napoléon eût traité avec le pape sur l'article des bulles et sur la
nouvelle clause à ajouter au concordat, sans y mêler autre chose. Il
lui eût rendu quelques conseillers et une liberté suffisante, et le
pape aurait tenu à honneur de ratifier ce qu'il avait promis, par le
fait d'une conviction intime, du moins en apparence.

Ce traité une fois signé, l'empereur n'avait plus besoin de concile,
et il pouvait être d'autant plus tenté de l'ajourner indéfiniment, que
sa convocation avait déjà jeté sur lui quelque ridicule, ce qu'il ne
pouvait guère se dissimuler. D'ailleurs, ne devait-il pas mieux lui
convenir de terminer avec le pape lui-même, dont il aurait vaincu
toutes les répugnances par ses négociateurs, que d'avoir à faire à une
assemblée sûrement tumultueuse et, probablement pour lui,
ingouvernable? Avec la promesse du pape, qu'avait-on à faire du
concile, qui n'avait été convoqué que dans la supposition que le pape
ne consentirait jamais à donner l'institution aux évêques nommés, et
encore moins à se lier pour l'avenir de façon à ne pouvoir plus
refuser cette institution? Or, tout cela était accordé et pouvait être
rédigé en traité. Le concile voudrait-il autre chose sur ce point?
Tant pis! et s'il ne voulait que cela, à quoi servait son
intervention? Elle n'était nullement agréable au pape; nous l'avons
vu. Elle ne pouvait l'être à l'empereur que dans un cas qui n'existait
plus. Et encore eût-il dû préférer pouvoir s'en passer. M. Duvoisin
était-il bien sûr de diriger à son gré ces quatre-vingt-quinze évêques
de France et d'Italie, qui, assez souples individuellement, pouvaient
se laisser aisément échauffer dans leur réunion? Et précisément parce
qu'ils sentiraient qu'ils n'avaient plus rien à décider, ils ne
devaient en être que plus disposés à susciter une foule d'embarras, de
questions incidentes et tracassières, pour qu'on ne pût pas leur
reprocher de n'avoir su rien dire, ni rien faire.

L'empereur comptait sans doute sur l'influence que pourrait prendre à
son profit le cardinal Fesch qui présidait le concile. Ici, il se
trompa, comme dans tout ce qu'il avait fait en élevant chacun des
membres de sa famille, dans la pensée de s'en servir ensuite. Son
oncle, le cardinal Fesch, avait à faire oublier son origine; et il
voulut, comme les frères de Napoléon, tirer sa considération de son
opposition à ses volontés, de son rigorisme, et non de son crédit sur
son neveu.

Ni l'empereur, ni même l'évêque de Nantes, que son succès à Savone
aurait dû mieux éclairer, ne sentirent toute la gravité de la réunion
du concile. Napoléon, qui n'était désarmé, ni par la cruelle situation
du pape ni par les concessions prodigieuses que, malgré cette
situation, on avait obtenues de lui, avait quelques phrases d'injures
contre le pape toutes prêtes, et il ne voulait pas les perdre. Il
tenait au ridicule honneur de les faire entendre dans le concile, sans
songer que l'assemblée, même la plus lâche, ne pourrait refuser un
intérêt, au moins de convenance, aux malheurs du Saint-Père, et ne
voudrait pas se déshonorer avec éclat.

L'évêque de Nantes se flatta peut-être aussi, et en cela il eut tort,
d'exercer une influence prépondérante dans le concile, par sa grande
habilité et par sa facile et brillante parole. Il croyait intéresser
d'abord, et acquérir ensuite des droits à la confiance de l'assemblée,
en rendant compte de ses conférences avec le pape. Il ne parvint qu'à
créer des jaloux. On ne lui pardonnait pas son succès; on refusait d'y
croire; et comme les quatre articles consentis par le Saint-Père
n'étaient pas signés de lui, on prétendit qu'on n'en devait tenir
aucun compte. En outre, on savait que l'empereur lui accordait une
bienveillance particulière, qu'il avait de fréquentes relations avec
lui; on en fit aussitôt un favori, et, à ce titre, toutes ses paroles
étaient suspectes. Puis l'empereur, dans ses violences, parlait aussi
durement du concile que du pape; et on supposa que M. Duvoisin était
l'instigateur de ce langage. Enfin, lorsqu'un jour il lisait dans
l'assemblée un projet d'adresse à l'empereur en réponse à son message,
et que, sur quelques objections qu'on lui fit quant à la rédaction, il
eut l'inconcevable maladresse de vouloir les écarter, en disant que le
projet, tel qu'il venait de le lire, avait déjà été communiqué à
l'empereur, il fut perdu sans ressource.

Ce qui reste démontré pour moi, c'est qu'il ne peut pas y avoir eu un
instant où Napoléon n'ait dû se repentir d'avoir convoqué cette
assemblée et de l'avoir laissé se réunir, puisqu'il a pu reconnaître à
quel point, après le retour de la députation de Savone, ce concile lui
était devenu inutile et combien il pouvait lui devenir funeste. Il est
également vrai que dans l'intention où était l'empereur de faire
tourner cette assemblée au profit de son pouvoir, il était impossible
de suivre une marche plus inconséquente et plus maladroite que celle
qu'il suivit.

Je ne veux que passer rapidement en revue la direction prise par
cette assemblée et quelques incidents qui s'y rapportent.

Le concile avait été convoqué pour le 9 juin 1811; mais, sous le
prétexte du baptême du roi de Rome, fils de Napoléon, il ne tint sa
séance d'ouverture que le 17 juin, dans l'église de Notre-Dame. M. de
Boulogne[62], évêque de Troyes, prêcha le sermon. L'assemblée comptait
quatre-vingt-quinze évêques (six étaient cardinaux) et neuf évêques
nommés par l'empereur, mais qui n'avaient pas reçu leur institution du
pape. Le cardinal Fesch, comme nous l'avons dit, prit d'emblée la
présidence que personne ne lui contesta, et, dans l'énumération de ses
titres, celui de primat des Gaules, qui lui revenait de droit en sa
qualité d'archevêque de Lyon. On verra plus loin, pourquoi nous
faisons mention de cette particularité. Après le sermon, le président
prêta le serment d'usage, que tous les évêques répétèrent après lui,
et qui est conçu dans les termes suivants:

«Je reconnais la sainte Église catholique, apostolique romaine, mère
et maîtresse de toutes les autres Églises; je jure une _obédience_
vraie au pontife romain, successeur de saint Pierre, prince des
apôtres et vicaire de Jésus-Christ.»

  [62] Étienne-Antoine de Boulogne, né en 1747, entra dans les ordres
  en 1771, fut en 1782 grand vicaire de M. de Clermont-Tonnerre à
  Châlons-sur-Marne. Il demeura à Paris durant toute la Révolution,
  fut emprisonné trois fois sous la Terreur, et proscrit au 18
  fructidor; mais il échappa alors à toute recherche. Sous l'empire,
  il devint grand vicaire de l'évêché de Versailles, puis évêque de
  Troyes (1807). A la suite du concile de 1811, il fut arrêté et
  enfermé à Vincennes. Il donna sa démission, et fut exilé à Falaise;
  mais le pape n'accepta pas sa démission, et M. de Boulogne revint à
  Troyes en 1814. Il fut créé pair de France en 1822 et mourut en
  1825.

Ce serment produisit beaucoup d'effet, en reportant l'attention sur
la malheureuse victime à laquelle il s'adressait. C'est à cela que se
borna la séance de ce jour-là.

Le lendemain même de l'ouverture, le 18, Napoléon manda quelques-uns
des évêques à Saint-Cloud, à une de ces réunions du soir qu'on
appelait les entrées. L'impératrice Marie-Louise et les dames qui
étaient de service auprès d'elle étaient présentes, ainsi que beaucoup
d'autres personnes, et entre autres, le prince Eugène, vice-roi
d'Italie. L'empereur, prenant du café que lui versait l'impératrice,
fit introduire le cardinal Fesch; l'évêque de Nantes, Duvoisin;
l'évêque de Trêves, Mannay; l'archevêque de Tours, de Barral, et un
prélat italien. Au moment où ils entrèrent Napoléon saisit vivement,
et de manière à ce qu'on le vît, le _Moniteur_, placé probablement par
ordre sur une table. Ce papier à la main, il aborda ces messieurs.
L'air troublé qu'il prit, la violence et le désordre de ses
expressions et l'attitude de ceux à qui il s'adressait, font de cette
singulière conférence une scène comme il aimait à en jouer, et où il
déployait sa brutale grossièreté.

Le procès-verbal de la première séance du concile se trouvait rapporté
dans le _Moniteur_ que l'empereur tenait; il le tordait dans ses
mains. Il attaqua d'abord le cardinal Fesch, et, ce qui est curieux,
c'est qu'il se jeta d'emblée, avec une volubilité singulière, dans une
discussion de principes et d'usages ecclésiastiques, sans la moindre
notion préalable, soit historique, soit théologique.

«De quel droit, monsieur, dit-il au cardinal, prenez-vous le titre de
primat des Gaules? Quelle prétention ridicule! Et encore, sans m'en
avoir demandé l'autorisation! Je vois votre finesse, elle est facile à
démêler. Vous avez voulu vous grandir, monsieur, pour appeler
l'attention sur vous et préparer par là le public à une élévation plus
haute encore dans l'avenir. Profitant de la parenté que vous avez avec
ma mère, vous cherchez à faire croire que je veux un jour faire de
vous le chef de l'Église: car il n'entrera dans la tête de personne
que vous ayez eu l'audace de prendre, sans mon autorisation, le titre
de primat des Gaules. L'Europe croira que j'ai voulu la préparer par
là à voir en vous un pape futur... Beau pape, en vérité!... Avec ce
nouveau titre, vous voulez effaroucher Pie VII et le rendre plus
intraitable encore!»

Le cardinal, blessé, répliqua avec fermeté et fit oublier, par sa
réponse honorable, le peu de dignité de sa figure, de son ton, de ses
manières, et même les souvenirs de sa première profession[63], dont on
retrouvait habituellement en lui trop de traces, car le corsaire
reparaissait souvent sous l'habit d'archevêque. Mais là, en face de
l'empereur, il eut tout l'avantage: il expliqua que, de tout temps, il
y avait eu, en France, non seulement un primat des Gaules, mais un
primat d'Aquitaine et un primat de Neustrie. Napoléon, un peu étonné,
se tourna vers l'évêque de Nantes et lui demanda si cela était vrai.
«Le fait est incontestable,» dit l'évêque. Alors, l'empereur quitta le
cardinal, que, jusque-là, il avait pris seul à partie. Il généralisa
sa colère, et, sur le mot d'_obédience_ dans le serment, qu'il
confondait avec celui d'_obéissance_, il s'échauffa jusqu'à appeler
les pères du concile des traîtres. «Car on est traître, ajouta-t-il,
lorsqu'on prête deux serments de fidélité à la fois, et à deux
souverains ennemis.»

  [63] Pendant les premières années de la guerre maritime,
  c'est-à-dire en 1793, 1794 et 1795, le cardinal Fesch montait un
  corsaire, nommé _l'Aventurier_. Il fit quelques prises qu'il amena
  à Gênes, qui, plus tard, lui occasionnèrent des procès qu'il
  soutint avec chaleur devant les tribunaux de cette ville, et pour
  lesquels il a, plusieurs fois, à ma connaissance, demandé l'appui
  du gouvernement. (_Note du prince de Talleyrand._)

L'évêque de Nantes dit quelques mots que l'empereur n'écouta pas. Il
ne fit attention ni à l'air triste, mécontent et réfléchi de M.
Duvoisin, ni à l'air abattu de MM. de Barral et Mannay, ni au maintien
soumis de l'Italien, ni au frétillement courroucé du cardinal Fesch,
et il continua à parler pendant une heure avec une incohérence qui
n'aurait rien laissé dans le souvenir que l'étonnement de son
ignorance et de sa loquacité, si la phrase qui va suivre, et qu'il
répétait toutes les trois à quatre minutes, n'avait pas révélé le fond
de sa pensée: «Messieurs, leur criait-il, vous voulez me traiter comme
si j'étais Louis le Débonnaire. Ne confondez pas le fils avec le père.
Vous voyez en moi Charlemagne... Je suis Charlemagne moi... oui, je
suis Charlemagne!»--Ce «je suis Charlemagne!» revenait à chaque
instant. Les évêques, après quelques vains efforts pour lui faire
comprendre la différence qui existe entre le mot d'_obédience_, qui ne
se dit qu'au spirituel, et celui d'_obéissance_, dont le sens est plus
étendu, se lassèrent enfin de leurs infructueux essais. Il ne leur
restait plus qu'à attendre, dans le plus profond silence, que la
fatigue mît fin à ce flux déréglé de paroles. L'évêque de Nantes,
profitant alors d'un moment de lassitude, demanda à l'empereur à lui
parler en particulier. Napoléon sortit, et il le suivit dans son
cabinet. Il était près de minuit, et chacun se retira de son côté,
emportant de Saint-Cloud d'étranges impressions.

A la suite de cette scène, l'empereur exigea que les deux ministres
des cultes, celui de France, M. Bigot de Préameneu, et celui d'Italie,
M. Bovara, assistassent à toutes les séances du concile. C'était une
inconvenance ajoutée à tant d'autres; ces deux laïques au milieu d'une
réunion tout ecclésiastique, où ils n'avaient pas le droit de prendre
part aux délibérations, ne pouvaient y occuper qu'une position aussi
blessante pour l'assemblée que pour eux-mêmes.

Les deux ministres se rendirent donc à la seconde séance du concile,
qui eut lieu le 20 juin. Ils présentèrent un décret impérial qui
ordonnait qu'un bureau serait formé du président, de trois évêques et
des deux ministres, et que ce bureau dirigerait les opérations du
concile. Il y eut quelque contestation à ce sujet, mais on passa
outre, et le bureau se trouva composé du cardinal Fesch, président; de
l'archevêque de Bordeaux (M. d'Aviau[64]), de l'archevêque de Ravenne
(Codronchi), de l'évêque de Nantes et des deux ministres. Ceux-ci
lurent ensuite un message de l'empereur, qui n'était qu'un long
manifeste contre Pie VII et contre tous les papes en général. C'était
l'empereur qui avait tout fait pour la religion; c'était le pape qui
faisait tout contre elle en France et en Italie; tel était, en résumé,
le sens de ce message, dont on attribua, dans le temps, la rédaction à
M. Daunou, ancien oratorien. On y annonçait que le pape avait violé le
concordat, que, par conséquent, il était aboli, et on demandait à
l'assemblée de trouver un nouveau mode pour pourvoir à l'institution
des évêques. Cette diatribe produisit juste l'effet contraire à celui
qu'en attendait l'empereur: c'est-à-dire un redoublement d'intérêt
pour le Saint Pontife, calomnié et persécuté. Et dans cette même
séance, la majorité prononça l'exclusion des délibérations des neuf
évêques nommés par l'empereur et non institués par le pape, qui,
jusque-là, avaient pris part aux opérations du concile. C'était déjà
un fâcheux présage pour le gouvernement.

  [64] Charles-François, comte d'Aviau de Sanzay, né en 1736, fut
  d'abord grand vicaire du diocèse d'Angers. En 1789, il fut nommé
  archevêque de Vienne, mais refusa le serment à la constitution
  civile et émigra. En 1802, il devint archevêque de Bordeaux et
  mourut en 1826.

Le 25 juin, le concile nomma une commission qui était appelée à
proposer une adresse à l'empereur en réponse à son message. Cette
commission fut composée de douze membres, y compris le président, le
cardinal Fesch; des cardinaux Spina[65] et Caselli[66] qui avaient
conclu, au nom de Pie VII, le concordat de 1801; des archevêques de
Bordeaux et de Tours; des évêques de Comacchio, d'Ivrée[67] de
Tournai[68], de Troyes, de Gand, de Nantes et de Trêves. Le 26, on
discuta le projet d'adresse; la rédaction en avait été confiée à
l'évêque de Nantes, et c'est pendant cette discussion qu'il eut, ainsi
que je l'ai déjà dit, l'insigne maladresse de laisser échapper que son
projet avait déjà été soumis à l'empereur, ce qui n'empêcha pas la
majorité de se prononcer contre le passage qui blâmait la bulle
d'excommunication. Le lendemain, 27, après l'adoption du projet amendé
de l'adresse, un évêque, celui de Chambéry[69] je crois, fit la
motion, et dans des termes très touchants, que le concile en masse
allât à Saint-Cloud demander à l'empereur la liberté du Saint-Père. Le
cardinal Fesch se hâta de lever la séance pour couper court à cette
motion, qui, sans cela, eût été certainement votée avec acclamation.

  [65] Le cardinal comte Joseph Spina, l'un des négociateurs du
  concordat de 1801, archevêque _in partibus_ de Corinthe, aumônier
  de la princesse Pauline, nommé archevêque de Gênes le 5 juillet
  1802.

  [66] Charles-François Caselli, né en 1740, entra dans l'ordre des
  Servites, et en devint le procureur général. Après la signature du
  concordat de 1801, il devint évêque _in partibus_ et cardinal
  (1802), puis évêque de Parme en 1804. Cette ville ayant été réunie
  à l'empire, le cardinal vint à Paris, où il séjourna jusqu'en 1814.
  Il revint à Parme en 1814, fut nommé conseiller intime de
  l'impératrice Marie-Louise devenue duchesse de Parme, et mourut en
  1828.

  [67] Joseph-Marie de Grimaldi, né en 1754, évêque de Pignerol en
  1797 puis d'Ivrée en 1805. En 1817, il devint archevêque de
  Verceil. Il appartenait à la vieille et puissante famille des
  Grimaldi, qui a longtemps possédé la principauté de Monaco.

  [68] François-Joseph de Hirn, né à Strasbourg en 1751, évêque de
  Tournai, en 1802.

  [69] Irenée-Yves, baron de Solles né à Auch en 1744, évêque de
  Digne le 29 avril 1802 et ensuite de Chambéry le 30 mai 1805.

Napoléon, très mécontent, refusa de recevoir l'adresse.

Il fallait, maintenant, que la commission des douze se prononçât sur
la proposition présentée par le gouvernement, et qui consistait à
trouver un moyen de suppléer à l'institution canonique des évêques par
le pape, quand celui-ci la refusait. L'évêque de Nantes fit un rapport
sur les travaux de la commission de 1810, au sujet de cette question;
et M. de Barral, archevêque de Tours, rendit compte du voyage des
trois évêques à Savone, et termina en lisant la note rédigée sous les
yeux du Saint-Père, et approuvée, mais non signée par lui.

On écarta immédiatement ce point, et un membre de la commission
demanda qu'avant tout on décidât la question de compétence du concile.
Cette proposition amena une discussion très vive, dans laquelle
l'évêque de Gand (M. de Broglie) parla avec chaleur contre la
compétence du concile. En définitive, la question posée: _Le concile
est-il compétent pour ordonner un autre mode d'instituer les évêques?_
huit voix se prononcèrent pour la négative[70], et les trois évêques
députés à Savone pour l'affirmative[71]. Le cardinal Fesch s'abstint.

  [70] Les cardinaux Spina et Caselli, MM. de Broglie, d'Aviau, Hirn,
  de Boulogne, de Grimaldi et l'évêque de Comacchio.

  [71] MM. de Barral, Duvoisin et Mannay.

Napoléon devint furieux quand il apprit ce résultat; il s'écria qu'il
chasserait le concile, qu'il n'en avait pas besoin, qu'il ferait
lui-même un décret auquel tout le monde obéirait et qui contiendrait
les concessions obtenues à Savone. L'évêque de Nantes, cette fois
encore, parvint à le calmer, et le fit consentir à ce qu'un projet de
décret serait porté au concile, qui renfermerait en effet, les
concessions de Savone; mais auxquelles on ajouterait un article pour
remercier le pape de ses concessions: et qu'on demanderait à
l'assemblée de sanctionner ce projet par son vote.

La commission des douze accueillit le projet de décret, mais avec une
restriction, c'est qu'avant d'avoir force de loi, il serait soumis à
l'approbation du pape, ce qui était déclarer implicitement
l'incompétence du concile. Le 10 juillet, le projet de décret amendé
fut communiqué au concile, Napoléon envoya le même soir à Vincennes
trois membres de la commission: l'évêque de Gand, M. de Broglie; celui
de Troyes, M. de Boulogne; et celui de Tournai, un Allemand dont j'ai
oublié le nom[72], et un décret impérial annonça que le concile était
dissous.

  [72] M. Hirn.

Cette dissolution du concile prononcée _ab irato_, ces violences
exercées contre trois de ses membres, ne résolvaient rien et créaient
même de nouveaux embarras, car il n'y avait plus moyen d'envoyer au
pape un projet de décret au nom d'un concile qui avait été dissous,
et qui l'avait été surtout parce qu'il avait soutenu qu'il fallait que
ce projet fût soumis au Saint-Père. Ce qu'on aurait si bien pu faire
avant le concile et par conséquent sans lui, on ne pouvait donc plus
le faire aujourd'hui.

Embarrassé dans les résultats de son emportement, Napoléon dut revenir
sur ses pas; il fallut recourir au pitoyable moyen de reconstituer
pour ainsi dire le concile après l'avoir dissous. On ramassa les
évêques qui n'étaient pas encore partis de Paris et ceux qu'on y
retint par ordre. On les appela chacun séparément chez le ministre des
cultes, et on obtint d'eux une approbation écrite au projet de décret
avec un nouvel article, toutefois, qui statuait que le décret serait
soumis au pape, et que l'empereur serait supplié de permettre qu'une
députation de six évêques se rendît auprès de Sa Sainteté pour la
prier de confirmer un décret qui seul pouvait mettre un terme aux maux
des Églises de France et d'Italie.

C'était une double inconséquence puisque, d'une part, on soumettait au
pape les propositions auxquelles il avait déjà consenti, et que de
l'autre, on sollicitait son approbation quand on avait dissous le
concile pour avoir demandé cette approbation.

Les évêques plus abattus qu'irrités, signèrent séparément ce qu'on
leur proposa, et dans une séance générale, le 5 août 1811, adoptèrent
par assis et levé (nouveau mode de voter suggéré par une ruse du
cardinal Maury) le projet suivant:

«ARTICLE PREMIER.--Conformément à l'esprit des canons, les archevêchés
et évêchés ne pourront rester vacants plus d'un an pour tout délai.
Dans cet espace de temps, la nomination, l'institution et la
consécration devront avoir lieu.

«ARTICLE II.--L'empereur sera supplié de continuer à nommer aux sièges
vacants, conformément aux concordats, et les nommés par l'empereur
s'adresseront à notre Saint-Père le pape pour l'institution canonique.

»ARTICLE III.--Dans les six mois qui suivront la notification faite au
pape par les voies d'usage, de ladite nomination, le pape donnera
l'institution canonique, conformément aux concordats.

»ARTICLE IV.--Les six mois expirés sans que le pape ait accordé
l'institution, le métropolitain ou, à son défaut, le plus ancien
évêque de la province ecclésiastique, procédera à l'institution de
l'évêque nommé, et s'il s'agissait d'instituer le métropolitain, le
plus ancien évêque de la province conférerait l'institution.

»ARTICLE V.--Le présent décret sera soumis à l'approbation de notre
Saint-Père le pape, et, à cet effet, Sa Majesté sera suppliée de
permettre qu'une députation de six évêques se rende auprès de Sa
Sainteté, pour la prier de confirmer un décret, qui seul peut mettre
un terme aux maux des Églises de France et d'Italie.»

Il n'y avait absolument aucune différence quant au fond, entre ce qui
avait été proposé d'abord par le concile, et ce qui fut adopté par la
nouvelle assemblée. L'article V demandait l'approbation du Saint-Père,
tandis que dans le projet primitif, c'était l'approbation de
l'empereur qui devait être sollicitée. Il est vrai que celle-ci était
fort inutile, puisque le projet n'était que l'expression littérale de
la propre demande de l'empereur. A quoi bon alors le lui soumettre?
Mais substituer aussi littéralement une expression à l'autre, pouvait
lui paraître une injure, si on lui eût proposé cette substitution;
aussi j'imagine que l'assemblée n'aurait pas osé la lui demander, et
qu'elle se trouva trop heureuse que le décret lui arrivât, revêtu de
l'approbation impériale, car ce fut Napoléon, c'est-à-dire son
conseil, qui proposa la rédaction. Son approbation était renfermée
dans la proposition faite en son nom au concile, dans l'envoi qu'il
faisait de la députation au pape, et dans les instructions qu'il
donnait à cette députation.--Et quant à l'approbation déférée au pape
par l'article V du décret et à laquelle le concile mettait une si
grande importance, l'évêque de Nantes put aisément persuader à
l'empereur que le premier projet qui avait été si violemment repoussé
par lui, n'était en réalité qu'une forme, à l'aide de laquelle on
demandait au pape s'il reconnaissait bien là son propre ouvrage. Il
n'y avait aucun inconvénient, ajouta-t-il, à accorder cette petite
satisfaction au concile, auquel il se chargeait de faire entendre que
les sévérités impériales envers quelques-uns de ses membres ne
provenaient pas de ce qu'ils avaient voulu insérer cet article dans le
décret, mais bien des dispositions hostiles qu'ils avaient manifestées
contre le gouvernement.

Quelques jours plus tard, le 19 août, quatre-vingt-cinq évêques, parmi
lesquels, cette fois, se trouvaient les neuf non institués, signèrent
en commun une lettre au pape, dans laquelle ils lui demandaient de
confirmer le décret. Puis on nomma neuf députés pour le lui porter à
Savone. Ces députés étaient les archevêques de Malines[73], de Pavie
et de Tours; les évêques d'Évreux, de Nantes, de Trêves, de
Plaisance[74], de Faenza et de Feltre, et pour que le pape ne pût pas
se plaindre qu'il était privé de son conseil, on lui envoya aussi cinq
cardinaux: MM. Doria[75], Dugnani[76], Roverella, de Bayanne[77] et
Ruffo[78], du concours desquels j'ai tout lieu de croire qu'on s'était
secrètement assuré. Enfin, on fit partir en même temps le _cameriere
secreto_ du pape, Bertazzoli, et son aumônier.

  [73] M. de Pradt.

  [74] Étienne-André Fallot de Beaumont, né en 1750, entra dans les
  ordres et devint évêque de Vaison (comtat Venaissin). Il protesta
  contre la réunion du comtat à la France, fut privé de son siège à
  ce moment, et se réfugia à Rome. En 1801, il fut nommé évêque de
  Gand, puis évêque de Plaisance (1807) et archevêque de Bourges
  (1813). Mais il ne reçut pas de bulle d'institution pour ce nouveau
  siège, et dut l'abandonner en 1814. Il vécut dès lors dans la
  retraite jusqu'à sa mort.

  [75] Giovanni Pamphili Doria, issu de la vieille famille gênoise de
  ce nom. Né en 1751, il fut archevêque à vingt ans, puis nonce à
  Paris, cardinal et secrétaire d'État (1797). Il devint ensuite
  camerlingue de la cour pontificale.

  [76] Antoine Dugnani, né en 1748, entra dans les ordres et devint,
  en 1785, archevêque _in partibus_ de Rhodes. Il était nonce à Paris
  en 1789. De retour à Rome en 1792, il fut créé cardinal, et en
  1800, contribua activement à l'élection de Pie VII. Son attachement
  pour ce pontife le fit exiler à Milan en 1808. Il fut conduit en
  France l'année suivante. Il revint à Rome en 1814, fut nommé évêque
  de Porto et de Santa-Ruffina, et mourut en 1818.

  [77] Alphonse-Hubert de Lallier, duc de Bayanne, né à Valence, en
  1739, fut d'abord auditeur de rote près la cour de Rome. Il fut
  créé cardinal en 1802. Il revint en France sous l'empire, joua un
  rôle assez actif dans les négociations entre le pape et l'empereur,
  et fut nommé sénateur en 1813. Il devint pair de France sous la
  Restauration et mourut en 1818.

  [78] Fabrice-Denis Ruffo, né en 1744, à Naples. Destiné à l'état
  ecclésiastique, il ne fut, néanmoins, jamais que diacre. Pie VI le
  nomma assesseur général et trésorier de la chambre pontificale. De
  retour à Naples, il fut nommé par le roi Ferdinand intendant du
  palais et devint son conseiller le plus écouté. Il fut créé
  cardinal en 1794. En 1798, il suivit le roi en Sicile, fut nommé
  par lui vicaire général avec des pouvoirs illimités. Il souleva les
  Calabres, et rétablit partout l'autorité royale. En 1805, Ruffo
  revint à Rome, puis alla en France en 1809; il ne put retourner en
  Italie qu'en 1814. En 1821, il fut nommé membre du conseil royal
  par le roi des Deux-Siciles et mourut en 1827.

Ils arrivèrent à Savone vers la fin du mois d'août. Le pape ne les
reçut que le 5 septembre. On dit qu'il ne les accueillit pas avec
autant de bienveillance que la première députation. Il ignorait ce qui
s'était passé au concile; d'ailleurs il ne prononçait jamais ce
nom-là, auquel il substituait toujours celui d'_assemblée_; ce qui
prouve combien il eût été facile dès la première députation, de
terminer avec le pape sur le point essentiel, celui qui était relatif
à l'institution des évêques, sans recourir à un concile dont le
Saint-Père ne se souciait nullement. Mais c'est ce que Napoléon ne sut
pas faire, et ce que personne n'eut l'habileté de lui persuader. Le
mal devint irrémédiable, parce que l'approbation du décret que l'on
obtint du pape, et qui devait mettre fin à cette grande affaire,
n'aboutit à rien par suite de l'humeur indomptable de Napoléon, qui,
près de tout conclure, chercha à tout brouiller et n'en trouva que
trop les moyens.

Après quelques explications fort douces entre la députation envoyée à
Savone et le pape, explications qui ne portaient sur aucune véritable
difficulté opposée par lui, le Saint-Père accéda de bonne grâce aux
cinq articles du décret. Il les inséra littéralement dans un bref, en
date du 20 septembre 1811, qu'il adressait aux évêques avec des
expressions pleines de tendresse paternelle, et sans le moindre retour
sur lui-même. Il rappelle dans le préambule, avec une reconnaissance
touchante, que Dieu a permis qu'avec l'agrément de son bien cher fils,
Napoléon Ier empereur des Français et roi d'Italie (ces deux titres y
sont mentionnés), quatre évêques vinssent le visiter et le prier de
pourvoir aux Églises de France et d'Italie. Il parle de l'affection
avec laquelle il les a reçus, et avec une véritable joie, de la
manière dont ils ont reporté ses vues et ses intentions. Il annonce
que d'après une nouvelle autorisation de son très cher fils Napoléon
Ier... cinq cardinaux et l'archevêque son aumônier sont revenus auprès
de lui, et que huit députés (car il en était mort un en route[79]) en
l'informant qu'une _assemblée_ générale du clergé a été tenue à Paris
le 5 août, lui ont remis une lettre qui relatait ce qui s'était passé
dans cette assemblée, et qui était signée par un grand nombre de
cardinaux, archevêques et évêques, et qu'enfin on le suppliait, en
termes convenables, d'approuver de nouveau cinq articles qu'il avait
_précédemment approuvés_.

  [79] L'évêque de Feltre.

Le pape après avoir entendu les cinq cardinaux et son camérier
l'archevêque d'Edesse, confirma tous les actes qu'on lui présenta. Il
ajouta seulement dans le bref qu'il voulait que le métropolitain ou
l'évêque le plus ancien, quand ils auraient à procéder à
l'institution, fissent les informations d'usage, qu'ils exigeassent la
profession de foi, qu'ils instituassent au nom du Souverain Pontife,
et qu'ils lui transmissent les actes authentiques constatant que ces
formalités avaient été fidèlement accomplies. Cette addition était une
clause toute simple; elle était une conséquence même de l'adoption des
articles, et il ne paraît pas que l'empereur lui-même s'en soit
formalisé lorsqu'il la lut.

Mais il n'en fut plus de même lorsqu'il prit connaissance des pièces
qui contenaient les félicitations et les éloges que le Saint-Père
adressait aux évêques pour leur conduite et leurs sentiments. A la
lecture d'une phrase qui témoignait que les évêques avaient montré,
comme il convenait, envers lui et envers _l'Église romaine qui est la
mère et la maîtresse de toutes les autres Églises, une véritable
obédience_ «aliarum omnium matri et magistri veram obedientiam»,
Napoléon n'y tint plus. Les mots _maîtresse_ et _obédience_ excitèrent
tantôt son rire, tantôt sa fureur, et il résolut de renvoyer le bref
avec mépris en exigeant une autre rédaction. Divers bruits circulèrent
à Paris sur ses dispositions variables et chaque jour plus hostiles
contre le Saint-Père. Enfin, sans aucun acte public, sans même qu'il
parût rien à ce sujet dans le _Moniteur_ (autant qu'il m'en souvient),
il se répandit au bout de quelque temps que les négociations avec le
pape étaient rompues. On ne réunit pas les évêques du concile pour
leur en faire part, mais on les renvoya dans leurs diocèses, sans leur
apprendre autre chose si ce n'est que tout était rompu avec le pape et
par sa faute.

Cependant le bref était rendu; Napoléon, peu accoutumé au langage de
la cour de Rome, pouvait y blâmer quelques expressions et même en
provoquer le changement; mais en dépit de lui, de ses violences, de
ses fureurs, les concessions demandées au pape et tant désirées
pendant trois ans avaient été accordées. Le bref avait même reçu un
commencement d'exécution à Savone, car le pape avait sans difficulté
donné l'institution à quatre évêques nommés par l'empereur, et le nom
de l'empereur se trouvait dans les bulles comme auparavant, ce qui
était bien clairement révoquer la bulle d'excommunication. Enfin le
pape acceptait ce qu'on avait été bien loin d'oser espérer, la clause
additionnelle au concordat; son bref n'était que cela, et l'empereur
pouvait donc désormais, quand il le voudrait, appliquer cette clause,
par un décret ou par un sénatus-consulte, sans avoir besoin de
recourir au pape. Pourquoi préféra-t-il renvoyer le bref, rejeter tout
ce qu'il avait d'utile à son point de vue, à cause de quelques
expressions qui étaient en dehors de la partie principale du bref, et
contre lesquelles, en l'acceptant, il pouvait faire toutes les
réserves qu'il aurait voulu?--Je l'ignore: il était capable de toutes
les inconséquences.

L'évêque de Nantes, s'il eût été à Paris, aurait pu, je pense, le
réconcilier avec les mots de _mère_ et _maîtresse_ de toutes les
Églises, et avec celui d'_obédience_, en les lui montrant plusieurs
fois répétés dans le fameux discours de Bossuet, prononcé à
l'ouverture de l'assemblée du clergé de 1682; il eût pu ajouter que
ces expressions sont conciliables avec les libertés de l'Église
gallicane, puisqu'elles signifient seulement que le pape a le droit de
parler, comme chef, à toutes les Églises catholiques, ce que reconnaît
l'Église de France comme les autres. Mais l'évêque de Nantes était à
Savone avec les autres députés, où ils devaient tous attendre de
nouveaux ordres.

L'empereur renvoya le bref; le pape le reprit avec douleur et dut le
regarder comme non avenu. Cependant avec la douce condescendance qu'on
lui connaissait, il était sûrement prêt, quand on le voudrait, à le
maintenir, puisqu'il ne l'avait pas donné conditionnellement, et que
surtout il n'avait rien demandé pour lui-même.

En lisant les instructions remises par Napoléon aux évêques députés,
avant leur départ pour Savone, on voit clairement, que ce n'est pas à
cause de quelques expressions répandues dans le texte du bref, et qui
n'en formaient point la substance, que l'empereur rejeta le bref tout
entier, et que c'est surtout, parce que le pape y parlait en son
propre nom. (Comme s'il pouvait faire autrement!)

Ces instructions, au reste, n'étaient pas de nature à rien concilier:
elles étaient d'une dureté révoltante, et dévoilaient à chaque mot le
désir évident de rompre la négociation. Ainsi les évêques députés
avaient ordre de dire au pape que l'empereur les avait chargés de lui
déclarer que les concordats avaient cessé d'être lois de l'empire et
du royaume d'Italie, et que le pape l'avait autorisé à prendre cette
mesure en violant lui-même depuis plusieurs années quelques
dispositions de ces traités; qu'en conséquence la France et l'Italie
allaient rentrer dans le droit commun. Les évêques étaient chargés en
outre, de lui demander son approbation _pure et simple_ au décret, et
ils devaient exiger que celui-ci embrassât non seulement la France et
l'Italie, mais encore la Hollande, Hambourg, Munster, le grand-duché
de Berg, l'Illyrie, enfin tous les pays réunis ou qui seraient réunis
par la suite à l'empire français. Ils devaient refuser cette
approbation, si le pape la faisait dépendre d'une _modification_,
_restriction_ ou _réserve quelconque_ excepté pour l'évêché de Rome.
Ils devaient lui dire, surtout, que l'empereur _n'accepterait aucune
constitution ni bulle d'où il résulterait que le pape refaisait en son
nom ce qu'avait fait le concile_. Enfin, ils ne devaient lui parler
que la menace à la bouche.

Il est probable que Napoléon, ne trouvant pas dans le bref,
l'exécution littérale de ses instructions, le renvoya aux députés,
pour que le pape eût à se conformer à celles-ci; qu'ils le lui
proposèrent, non avec menace, sans doute, mais avec des formes
respectueuses et suppliantes, en lui apprenant la manière dont le bref
avait été reçu; et que le Saint-Père voyant bien qu'il n'y avait
aucune possibilité de satisfaire l'empereur par les seuls moyens à sa
disposition, refusa à son tour ce qu'on voulait si durement et si
arbitrairement exiger de lui.

J'oubliais de dire qu'on avait remarqué dans le bref que le nom de
concile n'était pas employé, mais seulement celui d'assemblée des
évêques. Cela devait être plus qu'indifférent à Napoléon; les évêques
seuls auraient pu en être blessés, et ils étaient loin de s'en
plaindre. L'empereur, qui avait traité ce concile si légèrement, qui
l'avait dissous avec tant de mépris, qui s'était repenti, chaque fois
qu'on lui en parlait, de l'avoir convoqué, devait être fort peu jaloux
de relever son titre, lorsque, surtout, le pape lui en donnait un, si
parfaitement équivalent. Cependant, son humeur querelleuse le porta à
puiser dans cette omission du mot de concile un nouveau sujet
d'attaque contre le Saint-Père, qu'il répétait souvent dans les
conversations, quoique ce ne fût pas là, assurément, le principal
motif de son refus et de sa colère.

Les évêques, qui étaient à Savone, y restèrent longtemps encore malgré
eux. Ils ne revinrent à Paris qu'au commencement du printemps de 1812.
L'empereur voulait, disait-il, les punir de leur maladresse. On ne
réunit pas même les membres du concile à Paris, pour leur faire part
de ce qui s'était passé à Savone; on leur avait fait dire le 2 octobre
1811, par le _ministre de la police_, qu'ils eussent à rentrer dans
leurs diocèses, et ils y retournèrent. On ne publia rien sur la
négociation, pas plus que sur le concile, pas plus que sur le bref.
Chacun tira de cet imbroglio ce qu'il voulut; et l'on pensa à autre
chose.

Les rigueurs continuèrent à Savone, dans le traitement qu'on y faisait
subir au Saint-Père pendant l'hiver de 1811 à 1812 et le printemps
suivant. A cette époque, il paraît qu'on eut quelque crainte, à
l'apparition d'une escadre anglaise, qu'elle pourrait enlever le pape;
et l'empereur donna l'ordre de le transférer à Fontainebleau. Il
partit le 10 juin de Savone, et on fit voyager jour et nuit ce
malheureux vieillard. Il tomba assez sérieusement malade à l'hospice
du Mont-Cenis; mais on ne le força pas moins à continuer le voyage. On
l'avait obligé à se revêtir d'habits qui ne pussent pas le faire
reconnaître sur la route qu'il parcourait. On avait eu grand soin
aussi de dérober sa marche au public et l'on garda même un secret si
profond, qu'en arrivant le 19 juin à Fontainebleau, le concierge qui
n'avait pas été prévenu de son arrivée et qui n'avait rien préparé,
dut le recevoir dans son propre logement. Le Saint-Père fut assez
longtemps avant de pouvoir se remettre des fatigues de ce pénible
voyage, et des rigueurs, au moins inutiles, dont on l'avait accablé.

Les cardinaux non disgraciés par Napoléon, qui étaient à Paris, de
plus l'archevêque de Tours, l'évêque de Nantes, celui d'Évreux, celui
de Trêves, eurent ordre d'aller voir le pape. On dit qu'il exprima le
désir que le cardinal Maury fût un peu plus sobre de ses visites. On
répandit le bruit que le pape serait amené à Paris, et on fit de
grands préparatifs pour le recevoir au palais archiépiscopal, où
toutefois il ne vint jamais.

La campagne de Russie, marquée par tant de désastres, touchait à son
terme. L'empereur, de retour à Paris le 18 décembre 1812, se
nourrissait toujours de chimériques espérances et méditait sans doute
encore de gigantesques projets. Avant de s'y livrer, il voulut
reprendre les affaires de l'Église, soit qu'il se repentît de ne les
avoir pas finies à Savone, soit qu'il eût la fantaisie de vouloir
prouver qu'il en ferait plus en deux heures de tête-à-tête avec le
pape, que n'en avaient fait le concile, ses commissions et ses plus
habiles négociateurs. Cependant il avait pris d'avance des mesures qui
devaient faciliter sa négociation personnelle. Le Saint-Père était
entouré depuis plusieurs mois de cardinaux et de prélats, qui, soit
par conviction, soit par soumission à l'empereur, dépeignaient
l'Église comme parvenue à un état d'anarchie qui mettait son existence
en péril. Ils répétaient sans cesse au pape que s'il ne se rapprochait
pas de l'empereur pour s'aider de sa puissance et arrêter le mal, le
schisme devenait inévitable. Enfin le pontife, accablé par l'âge, par
les infirmités et par les inquiétudes et les soucis dont on agitait
son esprit, se trouvait bien préparé pour la scène que Napoléon avait
projeté de jouer et qui devait lui assurer ce qu'il croyait être un
succès.

Le 19 janvier 1813, l'empereur accompagné de l'impératrice
Marie-Louise, entra inopinément dans l'appartement du Saint-Père, se
précipita vers lui, et l'embrassa avec effusion. Pie VII, surpris et
touché, se laissa entraîner, après quelques explications, à donner son
approbation aux propositions qu'on lui imposa, plutôt qu'on ne les lui
soumit. Elles furent rédigées en onze articles qui n'étaient pas
encore un concordat, mais qui devaient servir de bases à un acte
nouveau. Le 24 janvier l'empereur et le pape apposèrent leur signature
sur cette pièce étrange, à laquelle manquaient les formes
diplomatiques d'usage, puisque c'étaient les deux souverains qui
avaient directement traité ensemble.

Il était dit dans ces articles: que le pape exercerait le pontificat
en France et en Italie;--que ses ambassadeurs et ceux accrédités près
de lui jouiraient de tous les privilèges diplomatiques:--que ses
domaines qui n'étaient pas aliénés seraient exempts d'impôts, et que
ceux qui l'étaient seraient remplacés jusqu'à la somme de deux
millions de revenu;--que le pape nommerait, soit en France, soit en
Italie, à des évêchés qui seraient ultérieurement désignés;--que les
évêchés _suburbains_ seraient rétablis et à la nomination du pape, et
que les biens non vendus de ces évêchés seraient restitués;--que le
pape pourrait donner des évêchés _in partibus_ aux évêques romains
absents de leur diocèse par l'effet des circonstances, et qu'il leur
serait fait une pension égale à leur ancien revenu, en attendant
qu'ils soient replacés dans des sièges vacants;--que l'empereur et le
pape se concerteraient en temps opportun sur la réduction à faire,
s'il y avait lieu, aux évêchés de la Toscane et du pays de Gênes,
ainsi que pour les évêques à établir en Hollande et dans les
départements hanséatiques;--que la propagande, la pénitencerie et les
archives seraient établies dans le lieu de séjour du Saint-Père; enfin
que Sa Majesté Impériale rendait ses bonnes grâces aux cardinaux,
évêques, prêtres, laïques, qui avaient encouru son déplaisir, par
suite des événements actuels.--L'article principal, consenti par le
Saint-Père à Savone, y figurait naturellement aussi, et il était
rédigé dans les termes suivants: _Dans les six mois qui suivront la
notification d'usage de la nomination par l'empereur aux archevêchés
et évêchés de l'empire et du royaume d'Italie, le pape donnera
l'institution canonique conformément aux concordats et en vertu du
présent indult. L'information préalable sera faite par le
métropolitain. Les six mois expirés sans que le pape ait accordé
l'institution, le métropolitain, et, à son défaut ou s'il s'agit du
métropolitain, l'évêque le plus ancien de la province procédera à
l'institution de l'évêque nommé, de manière qu'un siège ne soit
jamais vacant plus d'une année._--Tel était l'article 4.

Par un dernier article, le Saint-Père déclarait qu'il avait été porté
aux dispositions ci-dessus par considération de l'état actuel de
l'Église et dans la confiance que lui a inspirée Sa Majesté, qu'elle
accordera sa puissante protection aux besoins si nombreux qu'a la
religion dans le temps actuel.

La nouvelle de la signature de ce traité répandit une grande joie dans
le public. Mais il paraît que celle du pape fut de courte durée. Les
sacrifices qu'il avait été amené à faire étaient à peine consommés,
qu'il en ressentit une amère douleur; elle ne put que s'accroître, à
mesure que les cardinaux exilés et emprisonnés, Consalvi, Pacca, di
Pietro, etc., en obtenant leur liberté, reçurent aussi l'autorisation
de se rendre à Fontainebleau. Ce qui se passa alors entre le
Saint-Père et ces cardinaux, je n'ai pas la prétention de le savoir;
mais il faut que Napoléon ait été averti par quelques symptômes de ce
qui allait arriver: car, malgré l'engagement qu'il avait pris avec le
pape de ne regarder les onze articles que comme des préliminaires qui
ne seraient pas publiés[80], il se décida néanmoins à en faire l'objet
d'un message que l'archichancelier fut chargé de porter au Sénat.

  [80] Le préambule de ce concordat porte en effet:

«Sa Majesté l'empereur et roi et Sa Sainteté, voulant mettre un terme
aux différends qui se sont élevés entre eux et pourvoir aux
difficultés survenues sur plusieurs affaires de l'Église sont convenus
des articles suivants, _comme pouvant servir de base à un arrangement
définitif_.»

Cette publicité prématurée donnée à un acte que le pape regrettait si
vivement d'avoir signé dut hâter sa rétractation, qu'il adressa le 24
mars 1813 par un bref à l'empereur. J'ignore sur quels considérants le
Saint-Père a fondé cette rétractation; mais on ne peut que déplorer
la faiblesse qui dirigea sa conduite, dans cette circonstance et qui,
à si peu d'intervalle, le fit consentir à se rétracter. La meilleure
explication qu'on puisse donner à cette conduite, c'est que, par suite
d'un affaiblissement physique et moral, son esprit a plié devant les
exigences de Napoléon, et n'a retrouvé ses forces que quand il s'est
senti entouré de ses fidèles conseillers. On peut regretter, mais qui
se croira en droit de blâmer?

Cette fois, l'empereur, quoique très irrité de la rétractation, crut
qu'il était de son intérêt de ne pas faire d'éclat, et prit le parti
de n'en tenir en apparence aucun compte. Il fit publier deux décrets:
un du 13 février et l'autre du 25 mars 1813. Par le premier, le
nouveau concordat du 25 janvier était proclamé loi d'État; par le
second, il le déclarait obligatoire pour les archevêques, évêques et
chapitres, et ordonnait, en conséquence de l'article IV de ce
concordat, aux métropolitains, de donner l'institution aux évêques
nommés, et, en cas de refus, ordonnait qu'ils seraient traduits devant
les tribunaux.

On restreignit de nouveau la liberté qui avait été momentanément
accordée au Saint-Père, et le cardinal di Pietro retourna à l'exil.
Puis Napoléon partit bientôt après pour cette campagne de 1813 en
Allemagne, prélude de celle qui devait amener sa chute.

Les décrets lancés _ab irato_ ne furent pas exécutés, et pendant les
diverses fluctuations de la campagne de 1813, le gouvernement impérial
tenta plusieurs fois de renouer avec le pape des négociations qui
n'aboutirent à rien. Les choses traînèrent ainsi en longueur, et l'on
ne prévoyait aucune issue, lorsque, le 23 janvier 1814, on apprit tout
à coup que le pape avait quitté ce jour-là même Fontainebleau et
retournait à Rome.

Napoléon était alors vivement pressé par les troupes alliées qui
avaient pénétré en France; mais, comme il comptait bien en triompher,
on ne comprit pas le motif d'une résolution si inattendue, si
précipitée. Elle s'explique cependant. Murat, qui avait abandonné la
fortune de l'empereur, et qui, comme nous l'avons déjà dit, avait
traité avec la coalition, occupait alors les États de l'Église, et il
est évident que Napoléon, dans son indignation contre Murat, préféra
laisser rentrer le pape dans ses États, à les voir dans les mains de
son beau-frère.

Pendant que Pie VII était en route et que l'empereur combattait en
Champagne, un décret du 10 mars 1814 annonça que le pape reprendrait
possession de la partie de ses États dont on avait formé les
départements de _Rome_ et de _Trasimène_. Le lion, quoique vaincu, ne
voulait pas encore lâcher toute la proie qu'il espérait bien
reprendre.

Le voyage du Saint-Père ne se faisait pas sans entraves et sans
difficultés, tellement que le gouvernement provisoire, que j'avais
l'honneur de présider, se vit obligé de donner des ordres, le 2 avril
1814, pour qu'on mît fin à toutes ces entraves, et qu'on rendît sur la
route au Souverain Pontife les honneurs qui lui étaient dus.

Il faut dire que le vice-roi d'Italie, Eugène, accueillit le pape avec
respect, et que Murat lui-même n'osa pas s'opposer à ce qu'il reprît
possession de ses États, quoiqu'il les occupât lui-même avec ses
troupes.

Le pape arriva le 30 avril à Césène, le 12 mai à Ancône, et fit son
entrée solennelle à Rome le 24 mai 1814.

En m'étendant aussi longuement que je viens de le faire sur les
négociations entre l'empereur et le pape, j'avais un double but: je
voulais montrer jusqu'où la passion pouvait entraîner Napoléon quand
il rencontrait devant lui les résistances mêmes du bon droit, et
prouver que, dans la question traitée ici, il eut également tort dans
le fond et dans la forme; c'est ce qu'il me sera facile, je crois, de
démontrer. Je n'ai plus rien à ajouter, ce me semble, pour constater
combien a été odieuse toute la conduite suivie par lui envers le pape,
depuis l'année 1806; les faits que je viens d'exposer avec
impartialité et avec autant de sang-froid qu'il m'a été possible d'en
mettre en rapportant d'aussi indignes persécutions, ces faits parlent
d'eux-mêmes; je risquerais d'en affaiblir l'impression en insistant.
Mais je tiens encore plus, peut-être, à faire ressortir les fautes
énormes, au point de vue de la politique générale, qui ont été
commises par l'empereur dans ses relations avec la cour de Rome.

Lorsque, en 1801, Napoléon rétablit le culte en France, il avait fait
non seulement un acte de justice, mais aussi de grande habileté: car
il avait immédiatement rallié à lui, par ce seul fait, les sympathies
des catholiques du monde entier; et, par le concordat avec Pie VII, il
avait raffermi sur une base solide la puissance catholique un moment
ébranlée par la Révolution française, et dont tout gouvernement sensé
en France doit aider le développement, ne fût-ce que pour l'opposer
aux envahissements du protestantisme et de l'Église grecque. Or,
quelles sont les forces principales du catholicisme, comme de toute
puissance, si ce n'est l'unité et l'indépendance? Et ce sont
précisément ces deux forces que Napoléon voulut saper et détruire le
jour où, poussé par l'ambition la plus insensée, il entra en lutte
avec la cour de Rome. Il s'attaqua à l'unité de l'Église catholique,
en voulant priver le pape du droit d'instituer les évêques; à son
indépendance, en arrachant au Saint-Siège son pouvoir temporel.

L'institution des évêques par le pape est le seul véritable lien qui
rattache toutes les Églises catholiques du monde à celle de Rome.
C'est elle qui maintient l'uniformité des doctrines et des règles de
l'Église, en ne laissant arriver à l'épiscopat que ceux reconnus
capables par le Souverain Pontife de les soutenir et de les défendre.
Supposez un moment ce lien rompu, vous tombez dans le schisme.
Napoléon était d'autant plus coupable à cet égard, qu'il avait été
éclairé par les erreurs de l'Assemblée constituante. Je ne crains pas
de reconnaître ici, quelque part que j'aie eue dans cette oeuvre, que
la constitution civile du clergé, décrétée par l'Assemblée
constituante, a été peut-être la plus grande faute politique de cette
Assemblée, indépendamment des crimes affreux qui en ont été la
conséquence. Il n'était pas permis, après un pareil exemple, de
retomber dans la même erreur et de recommencer contre Pie VII les
persécutions de la Convention et du Directoire contre Pie VI, qui
avaient été si sévèrement et si justement blâmées par Napoléon
lui-même. Il n'y a donc aucune excuse possible pour sa conduite dans
cette question. On m'opposerait en vain qu'il s'est rencontré des
papes turbulents qui ont abusé de l'institution des évêques et s'en
sont fait une arme contre des gouvernements même catholiques. Je
répondrai à cela que c'est exact, mais que ces gouvernements se sont
tirés de cet embarras; qu'on ferait de même si on s'y trouvait encore,
et que c'est une mauvaise politique, pour prévenir un abus possible,
de créer un danger réel. Ajoutons que Napoléon était moins justifiable
que tout autre d'agir comme il l'a fait, après avoir rencontré dans
Pie VII les facilités les plus inespérées, pour régler les affaires de
l'Église, et une mansuétude et une douceur qui ne se sont pas
démenties un seul instant, malgré les plus odieux procédés: car la
bulle d'excommunication est un incident qui n'a eu aucune portée. Et
combien faut-il que Napoléon ait été coupable dans cette occasion,
pour que lui, qui se vantait tant de créer partout des ennemis à
l'Angleterre, comme jadis Mithridate aux Romains, en soit venu à faire
du pape un allié des Anglais, et pour qu'il ait pu craindre un instant
de voir ceux-ci lui enlever sa victime à Savone?

La destruction du pouvoir temporel du pape par l'absorption des États
romains dans le _grand empire_ était, politiquement parlant, une faute
non moins grave. Il saute aux yeux que le chef d'une religion aussi
universellement répandue sur la terre que l'est la religion catholique
a besoin de la plus parfaite indépendance pour exercer impartialement
son pouvoir et son influence. Dans l'état actuel du monde, au milieu
des divisions territoriales créées par le temps et des complications
politiques résultant de la civilisation, cette indépendance ne peut
exister que si elle est garantie par une souveraineté temporelle. Il
serait aussi absurde de vouloir remonter au temps de la primitive
Église, où le pape n'était que l'évêque de Rome, parce que le
christianisme était renfermé dans l'empire romain, qu'il était insensé
à Napoléon de prétendre faire du Saint-Père un évêque français. Que
devenait alors le catholicisme dans tous les pays qui ne faisaient pas
partie de l'empire français? Que penserait la France si le pape était
entre les mains de l'Autriche ou de toute autre puissance catholique?
Le croirait-elle bien impartial, bien indépendant? Quelque illusion
que pût se faire Napoléon sur l'étendue et sur la durée de sa
puissance, dans sa personne, ou dans celle de ses successeurs, il ne
devait pas créer un précédent aussi dangereux et qui pouvait, un
jour, être fatal à la France. 1814 a prouvé que, dans ce genre, rien
n'était impossible.

Je m'arrête: j'en ai dit assez pour montrer tout le mal que
l'insatiable ambition de l'empereur préparait pour la France dans
l'avenir. Mais, me diront peut-être les révolutionnaires de l'espèce
de ceux de 1800, pourquoi, alors, avoir rétabli la religion, la
papauté? C'est Napoléon lui-même qui leur a d'avance répondu en
faisant le concordat de 1801; mais c'est le Napoléon vraiment grand,
éclairé, guidé par son beau génie, et non par les passions furieuses
qui, plus tard, l'ont étouffé.

CHUTE DE L'EMPIRE--RESTAURATION

(1813-1814)


Il faut maintenant que l'attention de mes lecteurs se reporte à
l'époque du règne de Napoléon où je disais que, par un arrangement
habile fait en Espagne, il aurait pu arriver à une paix générale et
consacrer ainsi son propre établissement.

Napoléon avait été élevé au pouvoir suprême par le concours de toutes
les volontés réunies contre l'anarchie; l'éclat de ses victoires
l'avait fait choisir, c'étaient là tous ses droits; des défaites les
annulaient, tandis qu'une paix glorieuse les aurait légitimés et
affermis. Mais, dupe de son imagination qui dominait son jugement, il
disait avec emphase qu'il fallait élever autour de la France un
rempart de trônes occupés par des membres de sa famille, pour
remplacer cette ligne de forteresses créée autrefois par Louis XIV. Il
trouvait parmi ses ministres et parmi ses courtisans des hommes pour
approuver cette extravagance; et la plupart de ces hommes étaient
d'anciens membres de la Convention, du conseil des Anciens... Mais le
bon sens des masses en France se bornait à désirer la conservation des
résultats vraiment utiles de la Révolution, c'est-à-dire le maintien
des libertés civiles dont l'empereur avait à peine laissé subsister
les formes, en plaçant sans cesse son pouvoir despotique au-dessus de
la loi.

Ses succès l'avaient tellement aveuglé qu'il ne voyait pas qu'en
poussant à l'extrême le système politique dans lequel il s'était
follement engagé, tant à l'intérieur qu'à l'extérieur, il lasserait
les Français aussi bien que les nations étrangères, et forcerait les
uns et les autres à chercher en dehors de lui des garanties qui
pussent assurer la paix générale, et pour les Français, la jouissance
de leurs droits civils.

Tout était insensé dans son entreprise contre l'Espagne. Pourquoi
ruiner un pays qui lui était attaché et dévoué? Pour n'en saisir
qu'une partie, tandis qu'il livrait ses riches colonies à l'Angleterre
qu'il prétendait détruire, ou au moins affaiblir partout? N'était-il
pas évident que si toutes les provinces de la péninsule étaient
forcées de plier sous le joug français et de subir la royauté de son
frère, les colonies espagnoles se soulèveraient par leur propre
impulsion ou par celle de l'Angleterre? Le chef-d'oeuvre de la
politique, à cette époque, aurait été d'isoler assez la
Grande-Bretagne pour la laisser sans un lien quelconque avec le
continent et sans des rapports nouveaux avec les colonies. Napoléon,
au contraire, par la guerre d'Espagne, lui ouvrit et le continent
d'Europe et les colonies d'Amérique.

En rappelant dans mes souvenirs ce qui m'avait frappé davantage
pendant les vingt années dont je viens de parler, je me suis souvent
fait cette question: que serait-il arrivé si l'empereur, à telle
époque de sa carrière, s'était arrêté, eût changé de système et ne se
fût occupé qu'à s'affermir? Ainsi, par exemple, après la paix de
Lunéville, après avoir signé son premier traité avec la Russie, conclu
la paix d'Amiens avec l'Angleterre, et fait reconnaître le recès de
l'empire par toutes les puissances de l'Europe, tout ne lui était-il
pas facile? La France avait acquis alors des limites auxquelles
l'Europe avait dû consentir; les oppositions intérieures étaient
calmées, la religion avait repris sa place dans l'État. Cette
situation ne laissait évidemment plus aucune chance à la maison de
Bourbon.

Si cette même pensée se présente quelquefois à Louis XVIII, que de
reconnaissance ne doit-il pas avoir envers la Providence, et que de
soins ne doit-il pas apporter au bonheur et à la prospérité de la
France! Qu'il songe un moment à tout ce qu'il a fallu depuis 1803,
pour préparer son retour[81]!

  [81] Rappelons ici que cette partie des _Mémoires_ du prince de
  Talleyrand a été écrite pendant la Restauration et avant la mort de
  Louis XVIII.

Il a fallu que toutes les illusions s'emparassent à la fois de
l'esprit de Napoléon; qu'il se livrât sans prévision aux expéditions
les plus hasardeuses; que, par caprice, il créât des trônes, et que
par d'autres caprices, il leur ôtât toute chance de stabilité, et se
fît des ennemis de ceux-là mêmes qu'il plaçait sur ces trônes. Il a
fallu que, pour détruire la confiance de la France et des nations
étrangères, il leur imposât des institutions, d'abord républicaines,
puis monarchiques, puis qu'il finît par les soumettre à sa despotique
domination. Il a fallu, enfin, qu'il donnât aux peuples, qui bientôt
s'entendent entre eux, la triste consolation de mépriser
successivement les différentes formes de gouvernement qui passaient
sous leur yeux, et qu'il ne vît pas que ce mépris, devait sortir parmi
les peuples, une disposition générale au soulèvement et bientôt après
à la vengeance.

Mais, si, dépassant encore cette date de 1803, nous nous reportons à
l'année 1807, où l'empereur avait vaincu l'une après l'autre
l'Autriche, la Prusse et la Russie et tenait entre ses mains le destin
de l'Europe, quel grand et noble rôle n'eût-il pas pu jouer alors!

Napoléon est le premier et le seul qui ait pu donner à l'Europe un
équilibre réel qu'elle cherche en vain depuis plusieurs siècles, et
dont elle est aujourd'hui plus éloignée que jamais.

Il ne fallait pour cela: 1º qu'appeler à l'unité l'Italie, en y
transférant la maison de Bavière; 2º que partager l'Allemagne entre la
maison d'Autriche, qui se serait étendue jusqu'aux bouches du Danube,
et la maison de Brandenbourg[82], qu'on aurait agrandie; 3º que
ressusciter la Pologne en la donnant à la maison de Saxe.

  [82] La maison de Hohenzollern-Brandenbourg, qui occupe le trône de
  Prusse.

Avec l'équilibre réel, Napoléon a pu donner aux peuples de l'Europe
une organisation conforme à la véritable loi morale. Un équilibre réel
eût rendu la guerre presque impossible. Une organisation convenable
eût porté chez tous les peuples la civilisation au degré le plus élevé
qu'elle puisse atteindre.

Napoléon a pu faire ces choses, et ne les a point faites. S'il les eût
faites, la reconnaissance lui aurait élevé partout des statues, et sa
mort aurait été pleurée chez tous les peuples. Au lieu de cela, il a
préparé l'état de choses que nous voyons, et amené les dangers qui
menacent l'Europe du côté de l'Orient. C'est sur ces résultats qu'il
doit être et qu'il sera jugé. La postérité dira de lui: cet homme fut
doué d'une force intellectuelle très grande; mais il n'a pas compris
la véritable gloire. Sa force morale fut très petite ou nulle. Il n'a
pu supporter la prospérité avec modération, ni l'infortune avec
dignité; et c'est parce que la force morale lui a manqué, qu'il a fait
le malheur de l'Europe et le sien propre.

Placé pendant tant d'années au milieu de ses projets, et, pour ainsi
dire, dans le cratère de sa politique, témoin de tout ce qui se
faisait ou se préparait contre lui, il n'y a pas eu grand mérite à
prévoir que tous les pays rangés nouvellement sous ses lois, que
toutes les créations nouvelles placées sous la domination de sa
famille, porteraient les premiers coups à sa puissance. Ce n'est pas
sans une douloureuse amertume, je l'avoue, que j'assistais à un pareil
spectacle. J'aimais Napoléon; je m'étais attaché même à sa personne,
malgré ses défauts; à son début, je m'étais senti entraîné vers lui
par cet attrait irrésistible qu'un grand génie porte avec lui; ses
bienfaits avaient provoqué en moi une reconnaissance sincère. Pourquoi
craindrais-je de le dire?... j'avais joui de sa gloire et des reflets
qui en rejaillissaient sur ceux qui l'aidaient dans sa noble tâche.
Aussi, je puis me rendre le témoignage que je l'ai servi avec
dévouement, et, autant qu'il a dépendu de moi, avec un dévouement
éclairé. Dans le temps où il savait entendre la vérité, je la lui
disais loyalement; je la lui ai dite même plus tard, lorsqu'il
fallait employer des ménagements pour la faire arriver jusqu'à lui; et
la disgrâce que m'a valu ma franchise me justifie devant ma conscience
de m'être séparé de sa politique d'abord, puis de sa personne, quand
il était arrivé au point de mettre en péril la destinée de ma patrie.

Lorsque Napoléon, repoussant toute transaction raisonnable, se lança,
en 1812, dans la funeste expédition de Russie, tout esprit réfléchi
pouvait presque fixer d'avance le jour, où, poursuivi par les
puissances qu'il avait humiliées, forcé de repasser le Rhin, il
perdrait le prestige dont l'avait entouré la fortune. Napoléon, battu,
devait disparaître de la scène du monde; c'est le sort des usurpateurs
vaincus. Mais la France, une fois envahie, que de chances contre elle!
Quels moyens pouvaient conjurer les maux qui la menaçaient? Quelle
forme de gouvernement devait-elle adopter, si elle résistait à cette
terrible catastrophe? C'étaient là de graves sujets de méditation pour
tous les bons Français; s'y livrer était un devoir pour ceux que les
circonstances, ou, si l'on veut, leur ambition, avaient déjà appelés,
à d'autres époques, à exercer de l'influence sur le sort du pays.
C'est ce que je me croyais le droit de faire depuis plusieurs années;
et, à mesure que je voyais approcher le redoutable dénouement,
j'examinais et je combinais avec plus d'attention et de soin les
ressources qui nous resteraient. Ce n'était ni trahir Napoléon ni
conspirer contre lui, quoiqu'il me l'eût plus d'une fois déclaré. Je
n'ai conspiré dans ma vie qu'aux époques où j'avais la majorité de la
France pour complice, et où je cherchais avec elle le salut de la
patrie. Les méfiances et les injures de Napoléon à mon égard ne
peuvent rien changer à la vérité des faits, et, je le répète
hautement: il n'y a jamais eu de conspirateur dangereux contre lui que
lui-même. Il n'en a pas moins fait exercer contre moi la plus odieuse
surveillance pendant les dernières années de son règne. Je pourrais
presque faire valoir cette surveillance comme un témoignage de
l'impossibilité dans laquelle je me serais trouvé de conspirer, si
même j'en avais eu le goût.

On me pardonnera de rappeler un incident de cette surveillance, qui me
revient à la mémoire et qui montrera ce que la police de l'empereur
savait faire de l'intimité de la vie privée. Au mois de février 1814,
j'avais, un soir, quelques personnes réunies dans mon salon, au nombre
desquelles étaient le baron Louis, l'archevêque de Malines, M. de
Pradt, M. de Dalberg et plusieurs autres. On causait un peu de tout,
mais particulièrement des événements graves du moment, qui
préoccupaient à bon droit tous les esprits. La porte s'ouvre avec
fracas, et, sans laisser le temps au valet de chambre de l'annoncer,
le général Savary, ministre de la police générale, s'élance au milieu
du salon en s'écriant: «Ah! je vous prends donc tous en flagrant délit
de conspiration contre le gouvernement!»--Quelque sérieux qu'il ait
essayé de mettre dans le ton de son exclamation, nous vîmes bientôt
que son intention était de plaisanter, tout en cherchant cependant à
découvrir, s'il le pouvait, quelques notions propres à alimenter ses
rapports de police à l'empereur. Il ne parvint pas, toutefois, à nous
déconcerter, et l'état des choses ne justifiait que trop bien
l'inquiétude que chacun lui exprima sur la situation périlleuse de
Napoléon et sur les conséquences qui pouvaient en résulter. Je serais
assez porté à croire que sans la chute de l'empereur, M. le général
Savary n'aurait pas manqué de faire valoir près de lui la hardiesse,
et, ce qu'il pensait être, l'habileté de sa conduite dans cette
occasion. C'est, décidément, un vilain métier que celui de ministre de
la police.

Ce qu'il y a de bizarre dans la conduite de Napoléon à mon égard,
c'est que, dans le temps même où il était le plus rempli de soupçons
sur moi, il cherchait à me rapprocher de lui. Ainsi, au mois de
décembre 1813, il me demanda de reprendre le portefeuille des affaires
étrangères, ce que je refusai nettement, comprenant bien que nous ne
pourrions jamais nous entendre sur la seule manière de sortir du
dédale dans lequel ses folies l'avaient enfermé. Quelques semaines
plus tard, au mois de janvier 1814, avant son départ pour l'armée, et
lorsque M. de Caulaincourt était déjà parti pour le congrès de
Châtillon[83], l'empereur travaillait presque chaque soir avec M. de
la Besnardière[84], qui, en l'absence de M. de Caulaincourt, tenait le
portefeuille des affaires étrangères. Dans ces entretiens, qui se
prolongeaient fort avant dans la nuit, il lui faisait souvent
d'étranges confidences. Eh bien, il lui a plusieurs fois répété, après
avoir lu les dépêches dans lesquelles le duc de Vicence rendait compte
de la marche des négociations à Châtillon: «Ah! si Talleyrand était
là, il me tirerait d'affaire.» Il se trompait, car je n'aurais pu le
tirer d'affaire, qu'en prenant sur moi, ce que j'aurais fait très
probablement, d'accepter les conditions des ennemis; et si, ce
jour-là, il avait eu le plus léger succès militaire, il aurait
désavoué ma signature. M. de la Besnardière me raconta aussi une autre
scène à laquelle il assista, et qui est trop caractéristique pour que
je ne la mentionne pas. Murat, pour rester fidèle à la cause de son
beau-frère, demandait qu'on lui abandonnât l'Italie jusqu'à la rive
droite du Pô. Il avait écrit plusieurs lettres à Napoléon, qui ne lui
répondait pas, ce dont il se plaignait amèrement, comme d'une marque
de mépris. «Pourquoi, dit la Besnardière à l'empereur, Votre Majesté
lui laisse-t-elle ce prétexte, et quel inconvénient trouverait-elle,
non pas à lui accorder ce qu'il veut, mais à le flatter de quelques
espérances?»--Il répondit alors: «Est-ce que je puis répondre à un
insensé? Comment ne sent-il pas que mon extrême prépondérance a seule
pu faire que le pape ne fût pas à Rome; c'est l'intérêt de toutes les
puissances qu'il y retourne, et, maintenant, cet intérêt est aussi le
mien. Murat est un homme qui se perd; je serai obligé de lui faire
l'aumône; mais je le ferai enfermer dans un bon cul de basse-fosse,
afin qu'une si noire ingratitude ne reste pas impunie.» Peut-on
comprendre si bien les folies des autres et ne pas se rendre compte
des siennes propres?

  [83] Dès le mois de novembre 1813, les négociations avaient
  commencé. Les alliés offraient alors les frontières des Alpes et du
  Rhin. Napoléon consentit à la réunion d'un congrès à Manheim. Mais
  les événements se précipitèrent, et le congrès ne se réunit que le
  7 février à Châtillon-sur-Seine. M. de Caulaincourt, ministre des
  affaires étrangères, y représentait l'empereur. Cette fois les
  alliés n'offraient plus que les limites de 1789. Le congrès se
  sépara le 19 mars, sans avoir abouti.

  [84] Jean-Baptiste de Gouey, comte de la Besnardière, né en 1765,
  était entré dans la congrégation des oratoriens sous l'ancien
  régime. En 1796 il entra au ministère des relations extérieures
  comme simple commis. Il devint en 1807, directeur de la première
  division politique, et garda ces importantes fonctions jusqu'en
  1814. Il devint conseiller d'État en 1826, se retira des affaires
  publiques en 1830, et mourut en 1843.

Je disais plus haut que Napoléon seul avait conspiré contre lui-même,
et je puis établir la parfaite exactitude de ce fait; car il est
constant que, jusqu'à la dernière minute qui a précédé sa ruine, il
n'a dépendu que de lui de se sauver. Non seulement, comme je l'ai déjà
dit, il pouvait, en 1812, par une paix générale, consolider à jamais
sa puissance; mais, en 1813, à Prague[85], il aurait obtenu des
conditions, sinon aussi brillantes qu'en 1812, du moins encore assez
avantageuses; et enfin, au congrès même de Châtillon, en 1814, s'il
avait su céder à propos, il pouvait faire une paix utile à la France
réduite aux abois, et qui, même, dans l'intérêt de sa folle ambition,
lui aurait offert des chances de retrouver plus tard quelque gloire.
La terreur qu'il avait su inspirer à tous les cabinets a maintenu
ceux-ci, jusqu'au dernier moment, dans la résolution de traiter avec
lui. Ceci réclame quelques développements, et je veux consigner ici
des faits qui sont à ma parfaite connaissance, et qui constateront
l'exactitude de ce que j'avance. Il faut d'abord nous transporter à la
frontière des Pyrénées, où les armées françaises soutenaient si
bravement une lutte inégale contre les troupes anglaises, espagnoles
et portugaises réunies. Nous reviendrons ensuite dans les plaines de
Champagne.

  [85] Après les victoires de Lutzen, de Bautzen et de Wurtschen,
  Napoléon, triomphant, avait consenti à un armistice qui fut signé à
  Pleiswitz, le 5 juin. L'Autriche s'interposa comme médiatrice et un
  congrès s'ouvrit à Prague le 12 juillet. Napoléon ne voulut rien
  céder; les négociations furent rompues le 10 août, et l'Autriche
  entra dans la coalition.

La place de Saint-Sébastien avait été prise à la fin du mois d'août
1813, et celle de Pampelune venait de se rendre dans les derniers
jours d'octobre, quand le duc de Wellington, qui voyait l'Espagne
délivrée de ce côté de ses ennemis, et était informé de la bataille de
Leipzig et des résultats importants qui la suivirent, se décida à
porter la guerre sur le territoire français, pour contribuer autant
que possible au triomphe de la cause générale de l'Europe; celle de
l'Espagne n'était que secondaire.

Il passa la Bidassoa vers le milieu de novembre, malgré la vive
résistance de l'armée française commandée par le maréchal Soult, et
son quartier général s'établit le premier jour à Saint-Pé, petit
village de la frontière.

Le temps était affreux, la pluie tombait par torrents, ce qui força
l'armée à faire halte, et le quartier général à rester à Saint-Pé. Le
hasard fit qu'il se trouvait dans ce village un curé plein d'esprit et
d'activité, tout dévoué aux Bourbons et à la cause royale; il avait
émigré en Espagne au commencement de la Révolution et il n'était
rentré en France qu'après le concordat. Son nom était l'abbé Juda,
très populaire parmi les Basques et très estimé parmi les Espagnols,
et comme le mauvais temps ne permettait pas au duc de Wellington de
sortir, l'ennui et l'oisiveté lui firent chercher la société du curé
chez lequel il était logé.

La conversation, naturellement, tourna sur l'état de la France et sur
l'esprit qui y régnait. Le curé n'hésita pas à affirmer qu'on était
fatigué de la guerre à laquelle on ne voyait aucun terme; qu'on était
surtout très irrité contre la conscription, et qu'on se plaignait
beaucoup du poids des impositions; enfin, qu'on désirait un changement
à peu près comme un malade désire changer de position dans son lit
avec l'espoir de trouver du soulagement: «Le colosse a des pieds
d'argile, disait l'abbé Juda, attaquez-le vigoureusement, avec
résolution, et vous le verrez s'écrouler plus facilement que vous ne
croyez.»

Ces conversations convainquirent le duc de Wellington de la nécessité
d'attaquer simultanément la France par toutes ses frontières si l'on
voulait obtenir du chef du gouvernement une paix honorable et sûre, et
il fit part de ce plan à son gouvernement.

Il ne fut pas question des Bourbons, car on voyait bien qu'ils étaient
oubliés et entièrement inconnus à la génération nouvelle. On voulut
cependant faire un essai de l'effet produit par l'apparition subite
d'un de ces princes sur une partie quelconque du territoire français,
et savoir à quoi s'en tenir; c'est ce qui motiva l'arrivée du duc
d'Angoulême[86] au quartier général de Saint-Jean-de-Luz dans les
premiers jours du mois de janvier 1814.

  [86] Louis-Antoine de Bourbon, duc d'Angoulême, fils aîné du
  comte d'Artois (1775-1844). Il avait épousé en 1799 la princesse
  Marie-Thérèse, fille de Louis XVI.

Le duc d'Angoulême fut très bien reçu par le général en chef, ce qui
était très naturel; par le maire de la ville de Saint-Jean et par le
clergé; mais sans produire aucun effet sur le peuple, excepté celui de
la curiosité. On courait sur son passage le dimanche, quand il allait
à l'église, sans témoigner aucun sentiment, ni donner aucune preuve
d'approbation ou de désapprobation. S'il y eut des offres de service,
des protestations de fidélité, elles restèrent très secrètes, et on
n'en vit pas le moindre effet à l'extérieur.

On attendait ainsi tout du temps, quand, vers la moitié du mois de
janvier, débarqua à Saint-Jean-de-Luz, venant de Londres, sir Henry
Bunbury[87], sous-secrétaire du ministère de la guerre, qui, parmi
différentes commissions importantes, avait celle d'informer le duc de
Wellington de l'acceptation par l'Angleterre des bases proposées à
Francfort par les souverains alliés pour régler la paix générale, et
de la nécessité de prévenir et d'empêcher que, sous la protection
anglaise, on excitât le peuple à la rébellion contre le gouvernement
existant avec lequel on était en négociation. Le gouvernement anglais,
par un sentiment très honorable, ne voulait pas soulever des peuples,
qu'à la paix, on aurait dû abandonner au ressentiment du gouvernement
de Napoléon, et il insistait tellement sur ce point que la situation
du duc d'Angoulême au quartier général devint très fausse pour lui et
très embarrassante pour le général en chef. En conséquence on ne
l'invita plus à prendre part aux opérations qu'on allait entreprendre,
comme on en avait eu d'abord l'intention; et lorsque, dans les
premiers jours du mois de février, il fut question de passer l'Adour
pour attaquer l'armée française et faire le siège de Bayonne, on
laissa le duc d'Angoulême à Saint-Jean-de-Luz, éloigné du théâtre des
opérations.

  [87] Sir Henry Edward Bunbury, né en 1778, lieutenant général dans
  l'armée anglaise. En 1809, il devint sous-secrétaire d'État au
  département de la guerre. En 1815, il fut chargé, avec l'amiral
  Keith, de notifier à l'empereur Napoléon son exil à Sainte-Hélène.
  Il entra à la Chambre des communes en 1830, et refusa peu après le
  portefeuille de la guerre. Il mourut en 1860.

C'est alors, et au moment de passer les gaves, que se présentèrent au
général en chef diverses personnes venant de Bordeaux, et parmi elles
M. de la Rochejacquelein[88], qui insistèrent beaucoup sur la
nécessité de faire un mouvement en faveur des Bourbons, faisant valoir
les bonnes dispositions de la ville de Bordeaux. Ils virent le prince
à Saint-Jean-de-Luz et, différentes fois, le duc de Wellington qui se
trouvait alors vers Saint-Palais. Ils tâchèrent de l'engager à
favoriser et à exciter ce mouvement, mais il fut inébranlable dans
ses refus, d'accord avec les instructions qu'il venait de recevoir de
son gouvernement.

  [88] Louis du Vergier, marquis de La Rochejacquelein, frère du
  célèbre général vendéen tué en 1794. Il naquit en 1777, suivit son
  père en émigration, et revint en France en 1801. En 1814, il vint
  au-devant du duc d'Angoulême à Saint-Jean-de-Luz et fut, peu après,
  nommé par Louis XVIII maréchal de camp. Durant les Cent-jours, il
  chercha à soulever la Vendée, mais fut tué le 4 juin au combat du
  Pont-de-Mathes. Il avait épousé la veuve du marquis de Lescure.

Le 27 février, les Français perdirent la bataille d'Orthez, qui laissa
à découvert tout le pays des Landes jusqu'à Bordeaux, et le duc de
Wellington, qui désirait avoir une communication plus facile, plus
directe et plus ouverte avec son pays, se décida à occuper cette ville
militairement, en y envoyant la 7e division de son armée, sous les
ordres de lord Dalhousie.

Les prières et les instances pour le mouvement en faveur des Bourbons
se renouvelèrent plus que jamais, et d'autres personnes arrivèrent de
Bordeaux, pressant ce mouvement à l'occasion de l'occupation
militaire.

Le duc de Wellington ne crut pas devoir s'y opposer; mais, voulant
éclairer le peuple de Bordeaux et l'informer de l'état des affaires
entre son gouvernement et ceux des alliés, il nomma le général
Beresford[89], maréchal général des troupes portugaises et le second
de l'armée, pour exécuter cette opération. Il lui donna les
instructions les plus positives de déclarer, avant d'entrer dans la
ville, et après l'occupation, «qu'on traitait la paix avec l'empereur
Napoléon, qu'il était même probable qu'elle était faite, et qu'une
fois publiée, l'armée alliée se retirerait du pays sans pouvoir
prêter assistance à personne; que c'était donc aux habitants de
Bordeaux à décider eux-mêmes s'ils voulaient courir les chances de
leur entreprise.»--On écrivit dans les mêmes termes aux deux
gouvernements de la péninsule, et la veille de son entrée à Bordeaux,
le maréchal Beresford déclara ce qu'on vient de lire au maire, M.
Lynch[90], qui, avec quelques autres personnes, était venu à la
rencontre du duc d'Angoulême, celui-ci ayant suivi le quartier général
de lord Beresford.

  [89] William Carr, vicomte Beresford, issu d'une famille
  irlandaise. Né en 1768, il entra dans l'armée, et fit les campagnes
  de 1793 et 1794 contre la France. En 1795, il passa aux Antilles,
  puis aux Indes (1799), en Égypte (1800), au Cap (1805). En 1806, il
  attaqua Buenos-Ayres, alors colonie espagnole, mais fut battu et
  fait prisonnier. De retour en Angleterre, il commanda une
  expédition contre Madère, débarqua en Portugal en 1808, et fut
  nommé commandant de Lisbonne. Il devint alors major général et
  général en chef des troupes portugaises. Il fit en cette qualité
  les campagnes d'Espagne jusqu'en 1814. Après la paix, il entra à la
  Chambre des lords. Il mourut en 1854.

  [90]Jean-Baptiste, comte Lynch, né à Bordeaux, en 1749. Sa famille
  d'origine irlandaise, avait émigré après la révolution de 1688, et
  s'était fixée dans cette ville. Lynch fut reçu en 1771 conseiller
  au parlement de Bordeaux. Il fut longtemps emprisonné sous la
  Terreur. Sous l'empire, il devint conseiller général de la Gironde
  et maire de Bordeaux en 1808. En 1814, il appela les Anglais et
  proclama la restauration des Bourbons dès le 12 mars. En 1815, il
  chercha avec la duchesse d'Angoulême à organiser la résistance,
  mais il échoua et s'enfuit en Angleterre. A la deuxième
  restauration il fut créé pair de France. Il mourut en 1835.

Cette déclaration répandit le découragement parmi la plupart de ceux
qui étaient dans le complot, et, pour neutraliser le mauvais effet
qu'elle pourrait produire dans le public, M. Lynch se hasarda à dire
dans une proclamation que le mouvement se faisait d'accord avec
l'armée anglaise, ce qui occasionna une réclamation très énergique de
la part du duc de Wellington, qui exigea une rétractation et qui
l'obtint enfin, malgré les démarches de M. Ravez[91], envoyé par le
duc d'Angoulême au quartier général du duc pour donner des
explications; elles ne contentèrent pas celui-ci, qui insista sur la
rétractation des expressions de M. Lynch, et elle eut lieu.

  [91] Simon Ravez, né en 1770, était en 1791 avocat à Lyon. Il prit
  une part active à la révolte de cette ville contre la Convention et
  dut, après la défaite des Lyonnais, se réfugier à Bordeaux. Il
  déclina toute fonction publique sous l'empire, et en 1814 fut un
  des premiers à proclamer la restauration des Bourbons. Il fut élu
  en 1816, député de la Gironde et devint, en 1819, président de la
  Chambre. En 1817, il avait été nommé sous-secrétaire d'État au
  ministère de la justice. Il se retira en 1830. En 1848, il fut
  nommé député à l'Assemblée législative, mais mourut en 1849.

Le reste du mois de mars se passa sans aucun événement décisif, les
Français se retirant toujours devant l'armée anglaise, et à la fin,
ils furent obligés de passer la Garonne dans les premiers jours
d'avril, pour prendre une forte position devant la ville de Toulouse,
sur le canal de Languedoc.

Le 6 avril, le quartier général anglais se trouvait à Grenade, sur la
rive gauche de la Garonne, et le même jour le duc de Wellington reçut
une lettre officielle de lord Bathurst[92], secrétaire d'État de la
guerre, qui lui annonçait «qu'à la réception de sa lettre, la paix
devait être faite avec l'empereur Napoléon, mais qu'il devait toujours
continuer ses opérations militaires jusqu'à ce qu'il ait reçu la
notification officielle de la paix, des plénipotentiaires anglais qui
étaient à Châtillon».

  [92] Henry comte de Bathurst, fils du chancelier de ce nom. Né en
  1762, il fut nommé en 1793, membre de la commission pour l'Inde et
  en 1809, secrétaire d'État de la guerre et des colonies, sous le
  ministère Castlereagh. Ardent adversaire de la France, il soutint
  énergiquement devant le parlement le parti de la guerre, et en
  1815, insista pour la détention de Napoléon à Sainte-Hélène. Il
  resta au pouvoir jusqu'en 1827, dut alors céder la place à un
  ministère whig, mais revint au pouvoir l'année suivante. Le
  contre-coup de la révolution de Juillet le força de nouveau à la
  retraite. Il mourut en 1834.

On passa, en conséquence, la Garonne le 8 avril, et, le 10, eut lieu
la bataille de Toulouse, sans que d'une part ni de l'autre on eût la
moindre connaissance de ce qui se passait à Paris, excepté de la
nouvelle de l'entrée des alliés dans la capitale, que les autorités
de Toulouse avaient fait afficher dans les carrefours.

Après la bataille, les Français évacuèrent la ville dans la nuit du 11
au 12, et telle était la persuasion du duc de Wellington de la
signature de la paix avec Napoléon, que quand, vers les dix heures du
matin et au moment de monter à cheval pour entrer dans la ville, le
12, on vint lui communiquer officiellement qu'on y avait proclamé les
Bourbons et qu'on avait arboré le drapeau blanc au Capitole, après
avoir renversé le buste de Napoléon, il ne cacha pas sa désapprobation
et son désir d'avoir été consulté par la ville avant d'avoir fait un
pareil mouvement. Il répéta alors ce qu'il avait dit aux Bordelais. Il
tint le même langage devant la municipalité de Toulouse, quand, après
avoir été reçu par la garde nationale avec les couleurs des Bourbons,
il mit pied à terre au Capitole. Les expressions du duc étaient
claires, précises, et n'admettaient pas d'interprétation.

Mais, vers trois heures de l'après-midi, arriva de Bordeaux le colonel
anglais Frédéric Ponsomby, précédant MM. de Saint-Simon et le colonel
H. Cook, envoyés par le gouvernement provisoire pour communiquer aux
deux armées les événements de Paris: l'abdication de l'empereur et le
rétablissement des Bourbons.

On accusa alors le gouvernement provisoire d'avoir retardé
l'information aux armées d'événements aussi importants et de n'avoir
pas prévenu l'effusion du sang, qu'occasionna la bataille de Toulouse.
Mais cette accusation était sans fondement, car le gouvernement
provisoire ne perdit pas de temps à faire partir M. de Saint-Simon et
le colonel H. Cook, chargés par lui d'informer les deux armées de
l'abdication de l'empereur et du rétablissement des Bourbons, et, bien
certainement, en examinant les dates de leurs dépêches, on voit qu'ils
seraient arrivés à temps pour sauver la vie à tant de malheureux, si,
arrêtés à Orléans et conduits à Blois où était l'impératrice
Marie-Louise, on les avait fait partir pour leur destination, au lieu
de les diriger sur Bordeaux où était alors le duc d'Angoulême.

Quand on examine bien les dates des derniers événements, et qu'on voit
qu'un mois après la déclaration de la ville de Bordeaux, non seulement
on continuait à traiter la paix avec Napoléon, mais qu'on la croyait
faite et signée avec lui, d'après la lettre, de lord Bathurst, reçue à
Grenade, on peut apprécier l'importance de cette déclaration et son
peu d'influence sur le renversement du gouvernement impérial et sur le
rétablissement des Bourbons, si les événements de Paris n'avaient pas
décidé bien autrement la question.

Il résulte de tous ces faits incontestables que le gouvernement
anglais était resté convaincu jusqu'au dernier moment que la paix
avait pu être signée à Châtillon avec Napoléon, ce qui, disons-le en
passant, diminue un peu le mérite que Louis XVIII prêtait, dit-on, au
prince régent d'Angleterre, quand il affirmait que c'était à lui,
après Dieu, qu'il devait son rétablissement sur le trône.

Revenons maintenant aux événements qui se passèrent à Paris et en
Champagne, et c'est ici qu'il convient de parler de la mission de M.
de Vitrolles au quartier général des souverains alliés. Les résultats
de cette mission serviront à éclaircir le fond de la question que je
traite, et, quant à la mission elle-même, je pourrais dire ce qu'il y
a de vrai dans la part qu'on m'y a attribuée.

Ainsi que je l'ai dit, il ne se tramait à Paris aucune conspiration
contre l'empereur; mais il y régnait une inquiétude générale et très
prononcée sur les conséquences qu'amèneraient et sa conduite insensée
et sa résolution de ne pas conclure la paix. Il devenait de la plus
haute importance de connaître le parti que prendraient les puissances
coalisées, le jour, inévitable pour les gens qui voyaient de près
l'état des choses, où elles auraient renversé la puissance de
Napoléon. Continueraient-elles à vouloir traiter avec lui?
Imposeraient-elles à la France un autre gouvernement, ou, en la
laissant libre de le choisir elle-même, la livreraient-elles à une
anarchie dont il était impossible de calculer les effets?

J'étais informé de quelques propos tenus par l'empereur Alexandre à la
grande-duchesse Stéphanie de Bade; d'insinuations faites aussi par ce
souverain à l'égard d'Eugène de Beauharnais et des prétentions de
Bernadotte. M. Fouché intriguait avec la reine Caroline, femme de
Murat. Enfin les journaux anglais m'avaient appris que le duc
d'Angoulême était au quartier général de lord Wellington, et que le
comte d'Artois s'était rendu en Suisse près de la frontière de France.
Il y avait là tant d'éléments divergents, qu'il était impossible de
s'arrêter à un système raisonnable tant qu'on ne connaîtrait pas les
véritables intentions des puissances coalisées, qui, en définitive,
seraient les maîtresses de la situation si elles triomphaient de
Napoléon. C'était donc leur opinion qu'il s'agissait de connaître. Il
fallait pour cela que quelqu'un de sûr se rendît à leur quartier
général. M. le baron de Vitrolles se présenta pour cette mission
délicate et difficile. Je ne le connaissais pas; mais il était lié
avec M. Mollien et avec M. d'Hauterive[93]. On m'en parla comme d'un
homme distingué, énergique, royaliste de coeur, mais ayant cependant
reconnu la nécessité d'établir en France avec la royauté, des
institutions constitutionnelles; je crois même me souvenir qu'il avait
écrit une brochure dans ce sens, qu'il publia après le rétablissement
des Bourbons[94].

  [93] Alexandre-Maurice Blanc, comte d'Hauterive, né en 1754, entra
  dans la diplomatie et fut secrétaire de M. de Choiseul-Gouffier à
  Constantinople. En 1792 il fut nommé consul aux États-Unis, mais
  fut destitué l'année suivante. Il rentra en France après le 18
  fructidor, et fut nommé chef de division au ministère des relations
  extérieures. Après le 18 brumaire, il entra au conseil d'État. En
  plusieurs occasions il eut à faire l'intérim du ministère des
  affaires étrangères. Il resta en fonctions sous la Restauration et
  mourut en 1830.

  [94] _Du ministère dans le gouvernement représentatif_, par un
  membre de la Chambre des députés (Paris, Dentu, 1815).--M. de
  Vitrolles était alors député des Basses-Alpes.

Les instructions données à M. de Vitrolles ne portaient que sur ces
deux points-ci: En supposant, ce qui est inévitable, que Napoléon
succombe dans la lutte, quel parti prendront les cabinets alliés?
Traiteront-ils encore avec l'empereur? Ou laisseront-ils la France
libre de choisir une autre forme de gouvernement?

M. de Vitrolles dut employer une route détournée et assez longue pour
se rendre au quartier général des alliés, où il n'arriva que le 10
mars 1814. C'était précisément le jour fixé où Napoléon devait donner
sa réponse définitive sur l'acceptation ou la non acceptation de
l'_ultimatum_ des puissances alliées. Cette réponse ayant été trouvée
dilatoire et non satisfaisante, les plénipotentiaires voulaient
rompre[95]. Mais M. de Caulaincourt, par son crédit personnel, obtint
un nouveau délai jusqu'au 15 mars. Je fais cette observation pour bien
constater que la mission de M. de Vitrolles n'eut aucune influence sur
la décision des gouvernements alliés[96] qui, jusqu'au 15 mars 1814,
persévérèrent dans la volonté de traiter avec l'empereur, et que c'est
l'entêtement seul de celui-ci qui empêcha les négociations d'aboutir.
Le 15 mars, on lui offrait encore les limites de la France en 1789, et
le traité de Chaumont[97] du 1er mars 1814 établit de la manière la
plus irréfragable qu'à cette date les puissances alliées ne songeaient
pas à d'autre souverain pour la France que Napoléon.

  [95] Les alliés offraient les limites de 1790. Napoléon dans le
  contre-projet produit le 15 mars par M. de Caulaincourt, exigeait
  la ligne des Alpes et du Rhin. En outre, il réclamait en Italie un
  établissement pour le prince Eugène, et un autre pour la princesse
  Élisa.

  [96] Nous avons voulu ajouter des éclaircissements sur ce point
  important des _Mémoires_ de M. de Talleyrand, et nous avons demandé
  à M. le comte de Nesselrode, aujourd'hui chancelier de l'empire de
  Russie, de nous communiquer les renseignements qu'il lui serait
  possible de nous donner à cet égard. Voici ceux qu'il a bien voulu
  nous fournir:

  «Pendant la campagne de 1814, et à la seconde entrée que les
  troupes alliées firent dans la ville de Troyes, le quartier général
  des souverains y séjourna. Je m'y trouvais, lorsque je vis entrer
  chez moi un monsieur qui m'était inconnu, et qui s'était fait
  annoncer sous le nom de M. de Saint-George. Puis, ce monsieur, se
  faisant bientôt connaître pour être le baron de Vitrolles, déclara
  qu'il était envoyé de Paris par plusieurs personnages pour faire
  des communications importantes aux souverains alliés; il désigna
  parmi ces personnages MM. de Talleyrand et de Dalberg. Pour
  s'accréditer auprès de moi, auquel il était spécialement adressé,
  il tira de sa poche une feuille de papier blanc et demanda de la
  lumière. A l'aide de cette lumière, il fit revivre l'encre
  sympathique, et je pus reconnaître l'écriture d'un de mes amis et
  parents, M. de..., qui me mandait:--«Recevez la personne que je
  vous envoie de toute confiance; écoutez-la, et reconnaissez-moi. Il
  est temps d'être plus clair. Vous marchez sur des béquilles.
  Servez-vous de vos jambes, et voulez ce que vous pouvez.»--M. de
  Vitrolles entra dans de grands détails sur la situation de
  Napoléon, sur la lassitude que la nation française éprouvait de son
  joug et sur le besoin qu'elle avait de garanties contre son
  despotisme. La disposition des souverains alliés n'était pas telle
  qu'on pût donner immédiatement suite à ces communications; et M. de
  Vitrolles dut repartir avec de vagues promesses.

  »Un autre incident plus grave survint quelque temps après. Vers la
  fin du mois de mars 1814, au moment où se livrait la bataille
  d'Arcis-sur-Aube (20 et 21 mars), j'assistais à une conférence qui
  se tenait à Bar-sur-Aube, entre les ministres des souverains
  alliés. La conférence terminée, le chancelier d'Hardenberg voulut
  me retenir à dîner. Je m'excusai, étant pressé de rejoindre
  l'empereur Alexandre et de lui rendre compte des délibérations qui
  venaient d'avoir lieu. J'eus ainsi le bonheur d'atteindre
  l'empereur Alexandre à Arcis, tandis que les autres ministres et
  l'empereur d'Autriche furent coupés de l'armée par le mouvement que
  Napoléon fit sur Saint-Dizier, et forcés de se diriger sur Dijon.
  Le même soir le quartier général russe était transporté au château
  de Dampierre. On y arriva tard. Le quartier général de l'empereur
  Alexandre s'y trouva réuni à celui du prince de Schwarzenberg.
  J'étais logé dans une mansarde. A peine endormi, un aide de camp du
  prince Wolkonsky vint me réveiller et m'inviter à descendre chez le
  prince de Schwarzenberg, pour aider à débrouiller et à lire une
  nombreuse correspondance des autorités de Paris avec l'empereur
  Napoléon, interceptée sur un courrier qui lui était adressé.

  »Je me mis sur-le-champ à la besogne, et je trouvai des lettres et
  des rapports écrits par l'impératrice Marie-Louise, par les
  ministres et entre autres par le ministre de la police, Savary,
  dans lesquels ils rendaient compte à Napoléon qu'ils n'avaient plus
  aucun moyen de résistance, et que l'opinion publique était fort
  animée contre lui; qu'il serait à peu près impossible de défendre
  Paris si l'ennemi s'en approchait. Enfin, on annonçait les succès
  du duc de Wellington sur la frontière des Pyrénées et l'arrivée du
  duc d'Angoulême à Bordeaux.

  »Je rendis immédiatement compte à l'empereur Alexandre des
  importantes informations contenues dans les lettres interceptées.
  Elles firent naître le projet de réunir la grande armée à celle de
  Blücher et de marcher sur Paris, en masquant ce mouvement par un
  corps de six mille hommes de cavalerie, qui suivrait Napoléon vers
  Saint-Dizier. L'empereur Alexandre communiqua ce projet au roi de
  Prusse avec lequel il se réunit sur des hauteurs devant
  Vitry-le-Français, et c'est là qu'il fut résolu que l'on marcherait
  droit sur Paris.» (_Note de M. de Bacourt._)

  [97] Le traité de Chaumont signé entre toutes les puissances
  alliées prolongeait leur alliance pour une période de vingt années,
  et déclarait qu'il ne serait fait de paix avec l'empereur Napoléon
  qu'autant que celui-ci accepterait l'ultimatum proposé au congrès
  de Châtillon.

M. de Vitrolles vit d'abord à Troyes MM. de Nesselrode et de
Stadion[98]. Il leur exposa l'état des esprits à Paris et dans les
parties de la France qui n'étaient pas encore envahies; il leur
déclara que plusieurs personnes qu'il nomma, désiraient un changement,
et des garanties législatives contre les violences et le caractère de
l'empereur, et qu'il devenait urgent de prendre un parti pour empêcher
la France de retomber dans l'anarchie.

  [98] Jean-Philippe-Joseph-Charles, comte de Stadion, né en 1763,
  homme d'État autrichien. Il débuta dès 1787 par être ambassadeur à
  Stockholm, puis à Londres en 1790. Il donna sa démission en 1792,
  et ne reparut sur la scène qu'en 1804. Il fut alors chargé de
  l'ambassade de Saint-Pétersbourg et contribua beaucoup à nouer la
  troisième coalition. Après la paix de Presbourg, il fut nommé
  ministre des affaires étrangères. Il dut se retirer après la
  campagne de 1809. A partir de 1812, il prit de nouveau une grande
  part aux incidents diplomatiques qui se succédèrent jusqu'à la
  chute de Napoléon. Il parut au traité de Toeplitz, aux conférences
  de Francfort, au congrès de Châtillon, et signa le traité de Paris,
  1814. En 1815, il fut nommé ministre des finances. Il mourut à Bade
  en 1824.

M. de Stadion le conduisit chez M. de Metternich, qui, après l'avoir
écouté, lui répondit:

«Qu'il voulait sans détour lui faire connaître toute la pensée des
puissances; qu'elles reconnaissaient que Napoléon était un homme avec
lequel il était impossible de continuer à traiter; que le jour où il
avait des revers, il paraissait accéder à tout; que lorsqu'il obtenait
un léger succès, il revenait à des prétentions aussi exagérées
qu'inadmissibles. Qu'on voulait donc établir en France un autre
souverain, et régler les choses de manière que l'Autriche, la Russie
et la France fussent, sur le continent, des pays d'une égale force, et
que la Prusse devait rester une puissance moitié moins forte que
chacune des trois autres; qu'à l'égard du nouveau souverain à établir
en France, il n'était pas possible de penser aux Bourbons, à cause du
personnel des princes de cette famille.»

Telle fut, d'après M. de Vitrolles, l'opinion exprimée par M. de
Metternich.

M. de Vitrolles, dévoué aux Bourbons, et que cette réponse
satisfaisait peu, pria M. de Nesselrode de lui ménager une entrevue
avec l'empereur Alexandre, et l'obtint.

L'empereur Alexandre répéta à peu près les mêmes choses que les
ministres, mais il ajouta, sur la question du choix du souverain pour
la France, qu'il avait pensé d'abord à établir Bernadotte, ensuite
Eugène de Beauharnais, mais que différents motifs s'y opposaient;
qu'au reste l'intention était surtout de consulter les voeux des
Français eux-mêmes, et que, même si ceux-ci voulaient se constituer en
république on ne s'y opposerait pas. L'empereur s'étendit encore plus
que les ministres sur l'impossibilité de songer aux Bourbons.

M. de Vitrolles vit aussi l'empereur d'Autriche qui lui dit qu'il se
rendait à Dijon, que l'empereur de Russie et le roi de Prusse
prendraient à Paris le parti que les circonstances indiqueraient, et
qu'il y viendrait plus tard.

M. de Vitrolles, au lieu de retourner à Paris, alla rejoindre M. le
comte d'Artois, qui, de la Suisse était entré en France et se trouvait
déjà à Nancy. Il y vit le prince le 23 mars et ne donna pas de ses
nouvelles à Paris, où il n'arriva qu'après l'entrée des alliés. Plus
tard il retourna près du comte d'Artois, à Nancy, mais chargé par le
gouvernement provisoire d'inviter le prince à venir à Paris[99].

  [99] Voir l'Appendice I à la fin de la septième partie, qui
  contient le récit de cette mission de M. de Vitrolles, par le duc
  de Dalberg.

Pendant tout ce temps que faisait l'empereur Napoléon?

Après avoir été attaqué par des forces considérables en avant d'Arcis,
le 20 mars, et avoir acquis la certitude que c'était la grande armée
alliée que l'empereur Alexandre commandait en personne, l'empereur
Napoléon passa sur la rive droite de l'Aube, et se porta par
Sommes-Puis et Olconte sur Saint-Dizier, où il arriva le 23 mars. De
Saint-Dizier, il se détermina à marcher sur les derrières de l'ennemi,
et alla coucher à Doulevent. Au moment de continuer son mouvement, il
reçut (je crois du maréchal Macdonald) le rapport que des forces très
nombreuses, on disait même une armée, suivaient son arrière-garde. En
conséquence de ce rapport, l'empereur suspendit sa marche, séjourna le
23 à Doulevent, et le maréchal Macdonald ayant insisté sur
l'exactitude des renseignements qu'il avait envoyés et dont l'empereur
avait douté, il se décida à se reporter avec toutes ses forces sur
Saint-Dizier, mais au lieu de l'armée dont il avait été fait mention,
il ne trouva qu'un corps de cavalerie commandé par le général
Wintzingerode[100], qui arrivé à Saint-Dizier, se sépara et se retira
dans trois différentes directions, Bar, Joinville et Vitry. La partie
la plus considérable prit cette dernière route.

  [100] Ferdinand baron de Wintzingerode, né en 1770 à Bodenstein
  (Wurtemberg), entra d'abord au service du landgrave de Hesse, puis
  à celui de l'empereur d'Allemagne. En 1797, il se rendit en Russie
  et obtint le grade de major, devint aide de camp d'Alexandre en
  1802, et ambassadeur à Berlin (1805). Il fit les campagnes de 1805,
  1806 et 1807. Il se trouvait à Essling en 1809, où il fut
  grièvement blessé. C'est alors qu'il fut nommé feld-maréchal. Il
  eut une part active aux campagnes de 1812, de 1813 et 1814, et se
  distingua particulièrement à la tête de la cavalerie russe. Il
  mourut en 1818.

L'empereur Napoléon tint une espèce de conseil pour savoir si on les
suivrait; mais, comme on craignait d'éprouver une forte résistance à
Vitry, de trouver peut-être le pont sur la Marne coupé, il fut décidé
qu'on se reporterait de nouveau sur Doulevent où l'on arriva le 28,
ayant séjourné un jour à Saint-Dizier. Ce fut à Doulevent que
l'empereur acquit la certitude de la marche des ennemis sur Paris, et
qu'il se décida à s'y porter en toute hâte. Il arriva le 29 à Troyes,
le 30 à Fromenteau et le 31 à Fontainebleau.

L'empereur avait informé l'impératrice Marie-Louise de son projet de
se porter sur les derrières des armées alliées, et, par là de les
forcer à la retraite. Cette lettre avait été écrite d'Arcis, et le
convoi avec lequel marchait le courrier qui la portait fut pris par
l'ennemi et lui donna connaissance de son mouvement, ce qui détermina
probablement la marche des alliés sur Paris.

Tous les faits que je viens de raconter là, sans trop me soucier de
l'ordre dans lequel je les ai rapportés, établissent, ce me semble,
jusqu'à la plus claire et la plus complète évidence les trois points
suivants:

1º Que jusqu'au 15 mars 1814, les puissances coalisées étaient bien
fermement décidées à traiter avec Napoléon, et, par conséquent, à
conclure avec lui un traité sur la base du maintien de son
gouvernement;

2º Que c'est Napoléon seul, qui, par son obstination, et par suite des
vaines espérances dont il se berçait, a amené sa propre ruine et
exposé la France au malheur de devoir traiter de son existence et de
son salut avec un ennemi vainqueur et triomphant partout;

3º Enfin, que les souverains alliés en entrant dans Paris, n'avaient
encore aucun parti pris sur le choix du gouvernement qu'ils
imposeraient à la France ou qu'ils lui laisseraient adopter.

Avant de poursuivre la rapide narration des faits que je rappelle
succinctement, et dans le seul but que je me propose, je voudrais
exposer les raisons qui me déterminèrent à adopter à l'époque de la
Restauration, le système que je suivis alors. Ce sera la meilleure
explication de l'influence que j'ai pu exercer dans ce temps-là, comme
c'en est, à mes yeux, la meilleure justification.

J'ai déjà dit que je m'étais souvent, dans les derniers temps de
l'empire, posé cette question: Quelle forme de gouvernement devait
adopter la France après la catastrophe de la chute de Napoléon?

Songer à conserver la famille de l'homme qui l'avait poussée dans
l'abîme, c'était vouloir combler la mesure de ses malheurs, en y
ajoutant l'abjection. Et de plus, l'Autriche qui, seule, aurait pu
entrevoir sans déplaisir la régence de l'impératrice Marie-Louise, ne
portait qu'une faible voix dans le conseil des alliés. Elle s'était
placée la dernière des grandes puissances qui avaient entrepris de
venger les droits de l'Europe, et l'Europe certainement n'avait pas
fait des efforts inouis pour mettre le trône de France à la
disposition de la cour de Vienne.

La Russie pouvait dans ses combinaisons songer à Bernadotte pour se
débarrasser d'un voisin incommode en Suède; mais Bernadotte n'était
qu'une nouvelle phase de la révolution. Eugène de Beauharnais aurait
pu, peut-être, être porté par l'armée, mais l'armée était battue.

Le duc d'Orléans n'avait pour lui que quelques individus. Son père
avait, pour les uns, le tort d'avoir flétri le mot d'égalité; pour les
autres, le duc d'Orléans n'eût été qu'un usurpateur de meilleure
maison que Bonaparte.

Et cependant, il devenait à toute heure plus pressant de préparer un
gouvernement que l'on pût rapidement substituer à celui qui
s'écroulait. Un seul jour d'hésitation pouvait faire éclater des idées
de partage et d'asservissement qui menaçaient sourdement notre
malheureux pays. Il n'y avait point d'intrigues à lier; toutes
auraient été insuffisantes. Ce qu'il fallait, c'était de trouver juste
ce que la France voulait et ce que l'Europe devait vouloir.

La France, au milieu des horreurs de l'invasion, voulait être libre et
respectée: c'était vouloir la maison de Bourbon dans l'ordre prescrit
par la légitimité. L'Europe, inquiète encore au milieu de la France,
voulait qu'elle désarmât, qu'elle rentrât dans ses anciennes limites,
que la paix n'eût plus besoin d'être constamment surveillée; elle
demandait pour cela des garanties: c'était aussi vouloir la maison de
Bourbon.

Ainsi les besoins de la France et de l'Europe une fois reconnus, tout
devait concourir à rendre la restauration des Bourbons facile, car la
réconciliation pouvait être franche.

La maison de Bourbon, seule, pouvait voiler aux yeux de la nation
française, si jalouse de sa gloire militaire, l'empreinte des revers
qui venaient de frapper son drapeau.

La maison de Bourbon, seule, pouvait en un moment et sans danger pour
l'Europe, éloigner les armées étrangères qui couvraient son sol.

La maison de Bourbon seule, pouvait noblement faire reprendre à la
France les heureuses proportions indiquées par la politique et par la
nature. Avec la maison de Bourbon, la France cessait d'être
gigantesque pour redevenir grande. Soulagée du poids de ses conquêtes,
la maison de Bourbon seule, pouvait la replacer au rang élevé qu'elle
doit occuper dans le système social; seule, elle pouvait détourner
les vengeances que vingt ans d'excès avaient amoncelées contre elle.

Tous les chemins étaient ouverts aux Bourbons pour arriver à un trône
fondé sur une constitution libre. Après avoir essayé de tous les
genres d'organisation, et subi les plus arbitraires, la France ne
pouvait trouver de repos que dans une monarchie constitutionnelle. La
monarchie avec les Bourbons offrait la légitimité complète pour les
esprits même les plus novateurs, car elle joignait la légitimité que
donne la famille à la légitimité que donnent les institutions, et
c'est ce que la France devait désirer.

Chose étrange, lorsque les dangers communs touchaient à leur terme, ce
n'était point contre les doctrines de l'usurpation, mais seulement
contre celui qui les avait exploitées avec un bonheur longtemps
soutenu qu'on tournait les armes, comme si le péril ne fût venu que de
lui seul.

L'usurpation triomphant en France n'avait donc pas fait sur l'Europe
toute l'impression qu'elle aurait dû produire. C'était plus des effets
que de la cause qu'on était frappé, comme si les uns eussent été
indépendants de l'autre. La France, en particulier, était tombée dans
des erreurs non moins graves. En voyant sous Napoléon le pays fort et
tranquille, jouissant d'une sorte de prospérité, on s'était persuadé
qu'il importait peu à une nation sur quels droits repose le
gouvernement qui la conduit. Avec moins d'irréflexion on aurait jugé
que cette force n'était que précaire, que cette tranquillité ne
reposait sur aucun fondement solide, que cette prospérité, fruit en
partie de la dévastation des autres pays, ne présentait aucun élément
de durée.

Quelle force, en effet, que celle qui succombe aux premiers revers!
L'Espagne, envahie et occupée par des armées vaillantes et nombreuses,
avant même de savoir qu'elle aurait une guerre à soutenir;--l'Espagne
sans troupes, sans argent, languissante, affaiblie par le long et
funeste règne d'un indigne favori sous un roi incapable;--l'Espagne
enfin, privée par trahison de son gouvernement, a lutté pendant six
ans contre une puissance gigantesque, et est sortie victorieuse du
combat. La France, au contraire, parvenue sous Napoléon, en apparence
au plus haut degré de puissance et de force, succombe au bout de trois
mois d'invasion. Et si son roi, depuis vingt-cinq ans dans l'exil,
oublié, presque inconnu, n'était venu lui rendre une force mystérieuse
et réunir ses débris prêts à être dispersés, peut-être aujourd'hui
serait-elle effacée de la liste des nations indépendantes.

Elle était tranquille, il est vrai, sous Napoléon, mais sa
tranquillité, elle la devait à ce que la main de fer qui comprimait
tout, menaçait d'écraser tout ce qui aurait remué, et cette main
n'aurait pu sans danger se relâcher un seul instant. D'ailleurs
comment croire que cette tranquillité eût survécu à celui dont toute
l'énergie n'avait rien de trop pour la maintenir. Maître de la France
par le droit du plus fort, ses généraux, après lui, n'eussent-ils pas
pu prétendre à la posséder au même titre? L'exemple donné par lui,
apprenait qu'il suffisait d'habileté ou de bonheur pour s'emparer du
pouvoir. Combien n'eussent pas voulu tenter la fortune et courir les
chances d'une si brillante perspective? La France aurait eu peut-être
autant d'empereurs que d'armées; et, déchirée par ses propres mains,
elle eût péri dans les convulsions des guerres civiles.

Sa prospérité, tout apparente et superficielle eût-elle même poussé
les racines les plus profondes, aurait été, comme sa force et son
repos, bornée au terme de la vie d'un homme, terme si court, et auquel
chaque jour peut faire toucher.

Ainsi rien de plus funeste que l'usurpation pour les nations que la
rébellion ou la conquête a fait tomber sous le joug des usurpateurs,
aussi bien que pour les nations voisines. Aux premières, elle ne
présente qu'un avenir sans fin de troubles, de commotions, de
bouleversements intérieurs; elle menace sans cesse les autres de les
atteindre et de les bouleverser à leur tour. Elle est pour toutes un
instrument de destruction et de mort.

Le premier besoin de l'Europe, son plus grand intérêt était donc de
bannir les doctrines de l'usurpation, et de faire revivre le principe
de la légitimité, seul remède à tous les maux dont elle avait été
accablée, et le seul qui fût propre à en prévenir le retour.

Ce principe, on le voit, n'est pas, comme des hommes irréfléchis le
supposent et comme les fauteurs de révolutions voudraient le faire
croire, uniquement un moyen de conservation pour la puissance des rois
et la sûreté de leur personne; il est surtout un élément nécessaire du
repos et du bonheur des peuples, la garantie la plus solide ou plutôt
la seule de leur force et de leur durée. La légitimité des rois, ou,
pour mieux dire, des gouvernements, est la sauvegarde des nations;
c'est pour cela qu'elle est sacrée.

Je parle en général de la légitimité des gouvernements, quelle que
soit leur forme, et non pas seulement de celle des rois, parce qu'elle
doit s'entendre de tous. Un gouvernement légitime, qu'il soit
monarchique ou républicain, héréditaire ou électif, aristocratique ou
démocratique, est toujours celui dont l'existence, la forme et le mode
d'action sont consolidés et consacrés par une longue succession
d'années, et je dirais volontiers par une prescription séculaire. La
légitimité de la puissance souveraine résulte de l'antique état de
possession, de même que pour les particuliers la légitimité du droit
de propriété.

Mais, selon l'espèce de gouvernement, la violation du principe de la
légitimité peut, à quelques égards, avoir des effets divers. Dans une
monarchie héréditaire, ce droit est indissolublement uni à la personne
des membres de la famille régnante dans l'ordre de succession établi;
il ne peut périr pour elle que par la mort de tous ceux de ses
membres, qui, eux-mêmes, ou dans leurs descendants, auraient pu être,
par cet ordre de succession, appelés à la couronne. Voilà pourquoi
Machiavel dit dans son livre du _Prince_: «Que l'usurpateur ne saurait
affermir solidement sa puissance, qu'il n'ait ôté la vie à tous les
membres de la famille qui régnait légitimement.» Voilà pourquoi aussi
la Révolution voulait le sang de tous les Bourbons. Mais, dans une
république, où le pouvoir souverain n'existe que dans une personne
collective et morale, dès que l'usurpation, en détruisant les
institutions qui lui donnaient l'existence, la détruit elle-même, le
corps politique est dissous, l'État est frappé de mort. Il n'existe
plus de droit légitime, parce qu'il n'existe plus personne à qui ce
droit appartienne.

Ainsi, quoique le principe de la légitimité n'ait pas été moins violé
par le renversement d'un gouvernement républicain que par l'usurpation
d'une couronne, il n'exige pas que le premier soit rétabli, tandis
qu'il exige que la couronne soit rendue à celui à qui elle appartient.
En quoi se manifeste si bien l'excellence du gouvernement monarchique,
qui, plus qu'aucun autre, garantit la conservation et la perpétuité
des États.

Ce sont là les idées et les réflexions qui me déterminèrent dans la
résolution que j'embrassai de faire prévaloir la restauration de la
maison de Bourbon, si l'empereur Napoléon se rendait impossible, et si
je pouvais exercer quelque influence sur le parti définitif qui serait
pris.

Ces idées, je n'ai pas la prétention de les avoir eues seul; je puis
même citer une autorité qui les partageait avec moi, et c'est celle de
Napoléon lui-même. Dans les entretiens dont je parlais plus haut,
qu'il eut avec M. de la Besnardière, il lui dit, le jour où il apprit
que les alliés étaient entrés en Champagne: «S'ils arrivent jusqu'à
Paris, ils vous amèneront les Bourbons, et ce sera une affaire
finie.--Mais, répondit la Besnardière, ils n'y sont pas encore.--Ah!
répliqua-t-il, c'est mon affaire de les en empêcher, et je l'espère
bien.» Un autre jour, après avoir longtemps parlé de l'impossibilité
où il était de faire la paix sur la base des anciennes limites de la
France: «sorte de paix, disait-il, que les Bourbons seuls peuvent
faire;» il dit qu'il abdiquerait plutôt; qu'il rentrerait sans
répugnance dans la vie privée; qu'il avait fort peu de besoins; que
cent sous par jour lui suffiraient; que son unique passion avait été
de faire des Français le plus grand peuple de la terre; qu'obligé de
renoncer à cette espérance, le reste n'était rien pour lui, et il
finit par ces mots: «Si personne ne veut se battre, je ne puis faire
la guerre tout seul; si la nation veut la paix sur la base des
anciennes limites, je lui dirai:--Cherchez qui vous gouverne, je suis
trop grand pour vous!»

C'est ainsi qu'obligé de reconnaître la nécessité du retour des
Bourbons, il accommodait sa vanité avec les malheurs qu'il avait
attirés sur son pays.

Mais revenons aux faits.

Je n'ai pas l'intention de raconter l'histoire de la restauration de
1814, qui sera écrite un jour par de plus habiles gens que moi. Il me
suffira de rappeler ici quelques-uns des principaux événements de
cette époque.

Pendant que Napoléon courait sur les derrières de la grande armée
coalisée, celle-ci s'était avancée vers Paris où elle arriva le 30
mars. Après une lutte très vive qui dura toute la journée du 30 et qui
fut bravement soutenue par les maréchaux Marmont et Mortier, ceux-ci
durent capituler dans la nuit du 30 au 31, ainsi qu'ils y étaient
autorisés par Joseph Bonaparte qui s'était retiré à Blois avec
l'impératrice et le roi de Rome[101].

  [101] Le roi Joseph en sa qualité de lieutenant général de
  l'empire, avait le 30 mars, à midi, autorisé le duc de Trévise et
  le duc de Raguse à entrer en pourparlers avec l'ennemi. En
  conséquence une convention fut signée le même soir, à six heures,
  entre les deux maréchaux et le comte de Nesselrode, qui réglait
  l'évacuation de Paris par les troupes françaises.

L'empereur Alexandre, le roi de Prusse et le prince de Schwarzenberg
entrèrent dans Paris le 31 mars à la tête de leurs troupes, et après
les avoir fait défiler dans les Champs-Élysées, l'empereur Alexandre
vint directement à mon hôtel, rue Saint-Florentin[102], où il avait
été précédé dès le matin par M. de Nesselrode. L'empereur Alexandre
devait d'abord descendre au palais de l'Élysée, mais sur un avis qui
lui avait été donné, je ne sais comment, qu'il n'y serait pas en
sûreté, il préféra demeurer chez moi[103].

  [102] M. de Talleyrand habitait rue Saint-Florentin un hôtel qui
  avait été construit au commencement du XVIIIe siècle par
  l'architecte Chalgrin pour Louis Phelypeaux comte de
  Saint-Florentin, ministre d'État. L'hôtel appartint successivement
  au duc de Fitz-James, puis à la duchesse de l'Infantado (1787). En
  1793, il fut transformé en une fabrique de salpêtre. Le marquis
  d'Hervas s'en rendit ensuite acquéreur, puis le vendit au prince de
  Talleyrand. C'est là qu'il mourut en 1838.

  [103] Nous avons désiré obtenir également sur ce point des
  éclaircissements de M. de Nesselrode. Voici ceux qu'il a eu
  l'obligeance de nous donner:

  «Le quartier général de l'empereur Alexandre se trouvait le 30 mars
  sous les murs de Paris, qui capitula dans la nuit du 30 au 31. Le
  31 au matin, l'empereur m'envoya, escorté d'un seul cosaque, à
  Paris. J'entrai ainsi le premier dans la ville par la barrière
  Saint-Martin et tous les boulevards, qui étaient couverts d'une
  foule immense. Je me rendis directement rue Saint-Florentin, à
  l'hôtel de M. de Talleyrand, qui m'accueillit à merveille, et qui,
  étant en train de se faire coiffer, me couvrit de poudre de la tête
  aux pieds, en m'embrassant. Pendant que j'étais chez M. de
  Talleyrand, l'empereur Alexandre me fit dire qu'on venait de
  l'avertir que le palais de l'Élysée où il voulait descendre, était
  miné, et qu'il devait se garder de l'habiter. M. de Talleyrand me
  dit qu'il ne croyait pas à ce bruit, mais que si l'empereur
  trouvait plus convenable de descendre ailleurs, il mettait son
  propre hôtel à sa disposition, ce que j'acceptai: et c'est ainsi
  que l'empereur vint s'établir rue Saint-Florentin.»

  Nous ajouterons ce que ne dit pas M. de Nesselrode, et ce que
  l'histoire a enregistré, c'est qu'il joua un rôle principal dans
  les grands événements qui se passèrent dans cet hôtel. C'est lui,
  entre autres, qui, conjointement avec le duc de Dalberg, rédigea la
  proclamation adressée par les souverains alliés à la nation
  française. Quelque grands que fussent les services rendus alors à
  Louis XVIII par MM. de Nesselrode et de Metternich, il est
  absolument faux qu'ils reçurent chacun un million de ce souverain.
  C'est une calomnie inventée par les libellistes, et répétée comme
  vraie par un des prétendus historiens de la Restauration, M. de
  Vaulabelle. Ces deux hommes d'État reçurent à l'occasion du traité
  de Paris, le cadeau diplomatique d'usage, une boîte de la valeur de
  dix-huit mille francs. (_Note de M. de Bacourt._)

Le premier objet traité entre l'empereur Alexandre et moi, ne pouvait
être naturellement que sur le choix du gouvernement à adopter pour la
France. Je fis valoir les raisons que j'ai exposées plus haut, et je
n'hésitai pas à lui déclarer que la maison de Bourbon était rappelée
par ceux qui rêvaient l'ancienne monarchie avec les principes et les
vertus de Louis XII, comme par ceux qui voulaient une monarchie
nouvelle avec une constitution libre, et ces derniers l'ont bien
prouvé, puisque le voeu exprimé par le seul corps qui pouvait parler
au nom de la nation, fut proclamé sur tout le sol français et retentit
dans tous les coeurs.

C'est la réponse péremptoire que je fis à une des demandes que
m'adressa l'empereur de Russie.--«Comment puis-je savoir, me dit-il,
que la France désire la maison de Bourbon?--Par une délibération,
Sire, que je me charge de faire prendre au Sénat, et dont Votre
Majesté verra immédiatement l'effet.--Vous en êtes sûr?--J'en réponds,
Sire.»

Je convoquai le Sénat le 2 avril, et le soir, à sept heures,
j'apportai à l'empereur Alexandre la mémorable délibération
que j'avais fait signer individuellement par tous ceux qui
composaient l'assemblée. C'était celle qui prononçait la déchéance
de Napoléon et le rétablissement des Bourbons avec des garanties
constitutionnelles[104]. L'empereur Alexandre resta stupéfait, je dois
le dire, quand il vit dans le nombre des sénateurs qui demandaient la
maison de Bourbon les noms de plusieurs de ceux qui avaient voté la
mort de Louis XVI.

  [104] Voir à l'appendice II (p. 261) une lettre de félicitations de
  Benjamin Constant à M. de Talleyrand sur son rôle dans la journée
  du 2 avril.

Le décret du Sénat rendu, la maison de Bourbon pouvait se considérer
comme installée presque paisiblement, non sur le trône de Louis XIV,
mais sur un trône solidement établi avec de véritables fondements
monarchiques et constitutionnels qui devaient le rendre non seulement
inébranlable, mais même inattaquable.

Je sais que tout ce que je viens d'écrire doit déplaire à bien du
monde, car je détruis, je crois, l'importance de tous les petits
efforts qu'une quantité de personnes dévouées fidèlement aux Bourbons,
se vantent d'avoir faits pour amener leur restauration. Mais je dis
mon opinion, et cette opinion, c'est que personne n'a fait cette
restauration, pas plus moi que les autres. Seulement j'ai pu dire à
l'empereur de Russie, dont j'avais depuis beaucoup d'années soigné la
confiance: «Ni vous, Sire, ni les puissances alliées, ni moi, à qui
vous croyez quelque influence, aucun de nous, ne peut donner un roi à
la France. La France est conquise, elle l'est par vos armes, et
cependant aujourd'hui même vous n'avez pas cette puissance. Un roi
quelconque, _imposé_, serait le résultat d'une intrigue ou de la
force; l'une ou l'autre serait insuffisante. Pour établir une chose
durable et qui soit acceptée sans réclamation, il faut agir d'après un
principe. Avec un principe nous sommes forts; nous n'éprouverons
aucune résistance; les oppositions, en tout cas, s'effaceront en peu
de temps; et un principe, il n'y en a qu'un: Louis XVIII est un
principe; c'est le roi légitime de la France.»

J'avais à cette époque l'avantage, par les relations politiques que
j'avais conservées, et par celles que j'avais nouvellement établies,
d'être en mesure de dire aux souverains étrangers ce qu'ils pouvaient
faire, et par ma longue habitude des affaires, d'avoir su démêler et
bien connaître les besoins et les voeux mon pays. La fin de ma vie
politique serait trop belle, si j'avais eu le bonheur d'être
l'instrument principal qui aurait servi, en rétablissant le trône des
Bourbons, à assurer à jamais à la France la sage liberté dont une
grande nation doit jouir.

J'ai omis de dire que, dans sa séance du 1er avril, le Sénat avait,
sur ma proposition, décrété la formation d'un gouvernement
provisoire[105].

  [105] Il fut composé de M. de Talleyrand, président; du duc de
  Dalberg, du comte de Jaucourt, de l'abbé de Montesquiou et du
  général Beurnonville.

La déchéance une fois prononcée par le Sénat dans la séance du 2,
Napoléon vit bien qu'il n'y avait plus pour lui d'autre ressource que
de traiter avec les souverains alliés, sur la situation qui lui serait
faite désormais. M. de Caulaincourt et deux de ses maréchaux[106]
vinrent à Paris pour suivre cette négociation. Ils s'acquittèrent très
noblement de cette pénible mission. Quelques jours auparavant, le 2
avril même, M. de Caulaincourt était déjà venu de Fontainebleau à
Paris pour soutenir les droits de Napoléon. Au moment où je partais ce
jour-là pour me rendre au Sénat et pour y faire prononcer la déchéance
de l'empereur, M. de Caulaincourt, avec lequel je venais d'avoir une
longue discussion en présence de l'empereur Alexandre, de M. de
Nesselrode et de plusieurs autres personnes, et qui avait défendu avec
chaleur et courage les intérêts de Napoléon, me dit: «Eh bien! si vous
allez au Sénat pour faire prononcer la déchéance de l'empereur, j'irai
de mon côté et pour l'y défendre.»--Je lui répondis sur le ton de la
plaisanterie: «Vous faites bien de m'avertir, je vais donner l'ordre
de vous retenir dans mon hôtel jusqu'à mon retour.--Vous pensez bien,
répliqua-t-il sur le même ton, que si j'en avais eu l'intention je me
serais bien gardé de vous prévenir. Je ne vois que trop qu'il n'y a
pas moyen de le sauver, puisque vous êtes tous contre moi.»

  [106] Le maréchal prince de la Moscowa et le maréchal duc de
  Tarente.

A la suite des négociations entre les puissances alliées et le
gouvernement provisoire d'une part, et les plénipotentiaires de
Napoléon de l'autre, un arrangement intervint, par lequel, l'empereur
et sa famille étaient traités libéralement, et où l'on avait même
respecté leur dignité par les termes employés à sa rédaction. La
déclaration des alliés était ainsi conçue:

«Voulant prouver à l'empereur Napoléon que toute animosité cesse de
leur part, du moment où le besoin d'assurer le repos de l'Europe ne se
fait plus entendre, et qu'elles ne peuvent ni ne veulent oublier la
place qui appartient à l'empereur Napoléon dans l'histoire de son
siècle, les puissances alliées lui accordent en toute propriété, pour
lui et sa famille, l'île d'Elbe[107]. Elles lui assurent six millions
de revenu par an dont trois millions pour lui et l'impératrice
Marie-Louise, et trois millions pour le reste de sa famille, savoir:
sa mère, ses frères Joseph, Louis et Jérôme, ses soeurs Élisa et
Pauline et la reine Hortense qui sera considérée comme soeurs, attendu
sa situation avec son mari.»

  [107] Voir sur ce point l'opinion de Fouché: _Lettre du duc
  d'Otrante à Napoléon_ (Appendice III, à la fin de la septième
  partie).

Il y eut plus tard un changement fait dans cette répartition,
l'impératrice Marie-Louise n'ayant pas suivi l'empereur Napoléon; la
répartition fut faite de la manière suivante:

L'empereur, deux millions; sa mère, trois cent mille francs; Joseph et
sa femme, cinq cent mille francs; Louis, deux cent mille francs;
Hortense et ses enfants, quatre cent mille francs; Jérôme et sa femme,
cinq cent mille francs; Élisa, trois cent mille francs, et Pauline,
trois cent mille francs.

Le gouvernement provisoire adhéra à son tour à cet acte par la
déclaration qui suit:

«Les puissances alliées ayant conclu un traité avec Sa Majesté
l'empereur Napoléon, et ce traité renfermant des dispositions à
l'exécution desquelles le gouvernement français est dans le cas de
prendre part, et des explications réciproques ayant eu lieu sur ce
point, le gouvernement provisoire de France, dans la vue de concourir
efficacement à toutes les mesures qui sont adoptées pour donner aux
événements qui ont eu lieu un caractère particulier de modération, de
grandeur et de générosité, se fait un devoir de déclarer qu'il y
adhère autant que besoin est, et garantit en tout ce qui concerne la
France, l'exécution des stipulations renfermées dans ce traité qui a
été signé aujourd'hui entre MM. les plénipotentiaires des hautes
puissances alliées et ceux de Sa Majesté l'empereur Napoléon.»

J'avais eu l'honneur d'être placé par le décret du Sénat du 1er
avril à la tête du gouvernement provisoire, qui, pendant quelques
jours, conduisit les affaires de la France. Je ne me laisserai pas
aller à parler ici de tous les actes de ce gouvernement; ils sont
imprimés partout; la plume brillante de M. de Fontanes se retrouve
dans plusieurs, et, puisque j'ai nommé celui-là, je suis bien aise de
rappeler les services que M. le duc de Dalberg et M. le marquis de
Jaucourt[108] ont rendus, à cette époque, à la France. C'est presque
un devoir pour moi, quand je vois la disposition dans laquelle on
paraît être d'oublier les hommes courageux qui se dévouèrent alors si
noblement pour sauver leur patrie.

  [108] François, comte puis marquis de Jaucourt, né en 1757, était
  colonel de dragons en 1789. Il fut en 1791, élu député à
  l'Assemblée législative, émigra l'année suivante, revint en France
  après le 18 brumaire, fut nommé membre du tribunat en 1802,
  sénateur en 1803, intendant de la maison du prince Joseph (1804).
  En 1814 il fit partie du gouvernement provisoire, fit l'intérim du
  ministère des affaires étrangères pendant le séjour de M. de
  Talleyrand à Vienne, et fut nommé pair de France. Il devint
  ministre de la marine en 1815. En 1830 il se rallia à la monarchie
  de Juillet, conserva son siège à la Chambre des pairs et mourut en
  1852.

En une heure, l'empire de Napoléon était détruit; le royaume de France
existait et tout était déjà facile à ce petit gouvernement provisoire;
il ne rencontra d'obstacles nulle part; le besoin de police, le besoin
d'argent ne se firent pas sentir un moment; on s'en passait à
merveille. Toute la dépense du gouvernement provisoire qui a duré
dix-sept jours et de l'entrée du roi à Paris est portée dans le budget
de l'année pour deux cent mille francs. Il est vrai que tout le monde
nous aidait. Je suis persuadé qu'on doit encore les frais de course
que je fis faire alors par les officiers de l'armée de Napoléon d'un
bout de la France à l'autre.

Le 12 avril 1814, M. le comte d'Artois, auquel j'avais envoyé M. de
Vitrolles à Nancy, fit son entrée dans Paris et prit le titre de
lieutenant général du royaume. Je lui retrouvai pour moi la même
bienveillance que dans la nuit du 17 juillet 1789, lorsque nous nous
étions séparés, lui pour émigrer, moi pour me lancer dans le
tourbillon qui avait fini par me conduire à la tête du gouvernement
provisoire. Étranges destinées!

Les devoirs de ma position me retinrent à Paris et me mirent dans
l'impossibilité d'aller au-devant de Louis XVIII. Je le vis pour la
première fois à Compiègne. Il était dans son cabinet. M. de Duras[109]
m'y conduisit. Le roi, en me voyant, me tendit la main et de la
manière la plus aimable et même la plus affectueuse me dit: «Je suis
bien aise de vous voir; nos maisons datent de la même époque. Mes
ancêtres ont été les plus habiles; si les vôtres l'avaient été plus
que les miens, vous me diriez aujourd'hui: prenez une chaise,
approchez-vous de moi, parlons de nos affaires; aujourd'hui, c'est moi
qui vous dis: asseyez-vous et causons.»

  [109] Amédée, duc de Durfort-Duras, né en 1770, maréchal de camp,
  premier gentilhomme de la chambre du roi. Il suivit Louis XVIII en
  exil, fut nommé pair de France à la Restauration, et mourut en
  1836.

Je fis bientôt après le plaisir à l'archevêque de Reims, mon oncle, de
lui rapporter les paroles du roi, obligeantes pour toute notre
famille. Je les répétai le même soir à l'empereur de Russie qui était
à Compiègne, et qui, avec un grand intérêt me demanda _si j'avais été
content du roi_? Je me sers des termes qu'il employa. Je n'ai point eu
la faiblesse de parler du début de cette entrevue à d'autres
personnes.

Je rendis compte au roi, avec beaucoup de détails, de l'état dans
lequel il trouverait les choses. Cette première conversation fut fort
longue.

Le roi se décida à faire, avant d'arriver à Paris, une proclamation
dans laquelle ses dispositions seraient annoncées; il la rédigea
lui-même; c'est de Saint-Ouen qu'elle est datée. Pendant la nuit qu'il
passa à Saint-Ouen, l'intrigue qui entourait le roi fit faire à cette
première déclaration quelques changements que je n'approuvai pas. Le
discours que je lui avais adressé en lui présentant le Sénat, la
veille de son entrée à Paris, montrera, plus que tout ce que je
pourrais dire, quelle était mon opinion, et quelle était celle que je
cherchais à lui donner. Voici ce discours:

«SIRE,

»Le retour de Votre Majesté rend à la France son gouvernement naturel
et toutes les garanties nécessaires à son repos et au repos de
l'Europe.

»Tous les coeurs sentent que ce bienfait ne pouvait être dû qu'à
vous-même; aussi tous les coeurs se précipitent sur votre passage. Il
est des joies que l'on ne peut feindre; celle dont vous entendez les
transports est une joie vraiment nationale.

»Le Sénat, profondément ému de ce touchant spectacle; heureux de
confondre ses sentiments avec ceux du peuple, vient, comme lui,
déposer au pied du trône les témoignages de son respect et de son
amour.

»Sire, des fléaux sans nombre ont désolé le royaume de vos pères.
Notre gloire s'est réfugiée dans les camps; les armées ont sauvé
l'honneur français. En remontant sur le trône, vous succédez à vingt
années de ruines et de malheurs. Cet héritage pourrait effrayer une
vertu commune. La réparation d'un si grand désordre veut le dévouement
d'un grand courage; il faut des prodiges pour guérir les blessures de
la patrie; mais nous sommes vos enfants, et les prodiges sont réservés
à vos soins paternels.

»Plus les circonstances sont difficiles, plus l'autorité royale doit
être puissante et révérée: en parlant à l'imagination par tout l'éclat
des anciens souvenirs, elle saura se concilier tous les voeux de la
raison moderne, en lui empruntant les plus sages théories politiques.

»Une charte constitutionnelle réunira tous les intérêts à celui du
trône et fortifiera la volonté première du concours de toutes les
volontés.

»Vous savez mieux que nous, Sire, que de telles institutions, si bien
éprouvées chez un peuple voisin, donnent des appuis et non des
barrières aux monarques amis des lois et pères des peuples.

»Oui, Sire, la nation et le Sénat, pleins de confiance dans les hautes
lumières et dans les sentiments magnanimes de Votre Majesté, désirent
avec elle que la France soit libre pour que le roi soit puissant.»

       *       *       *       *       *

Je retournai à Paris pour m'occuper des préparatifs de l'entrée de
Louis XVIII, qui fut très brillante. On lui montra de toutes parts que
la France voyait en lui l'assurance de la paix, sa gloire sauvée et la
liberté rétablie. Il y avait de la reconnaissance sur tous les
visages. Madame la duchesse d'Angoulême, en se précipitant à genoux à
l'église Notre-Dame, parut sublime à tous; tous les yeux étaient
remplis de larmes.

Le roi reçut dans les deux premières matinées presque tous les corps
de l'État; les harangues étaient très bonnes, et les réponses du roi,
convenables et affectueuses. Les souverains étrangers eurent la
délicatesse de se peu montrer.

Les cours des Tuileries, les places publiques, les spectacles étaient
remplis de monde; il y avait partout de la foule, partout de l'ordre,
et pas un soldat.

Bientôt il fallut s'occuper de rédiger la charte qui était annoncée,
et alors l'intrigue et l'incapacité obsédèrent le roi et s'emparèrent
de cette importante rédaction. Je n'y eus aucune part; le roi ne me
désigna même point pour être un des membres de la commission qui en
avait été chargée. Je suis obligé d'en laisser tout l'honneur à M.
l'abbé de Montesquiou[110], à M. Dambray[111], à M. Ferrand[112] et à
M. de Sémonville. Je ne nomme que les principaux rédacteurs. Quant à
moi, je n'ai connu la charte qu'à la lecture qui en fut faite par M.
le chancelier Dambray dans un conseil des ministres, la veille de
l'ouverture des Chambres, et j'ignorai les noms des personnes qui
devaient composer la Chambre des pairs jusqu'à la séance royale où M.
le chancelier les proclama.

  [110] François-Xavier-Marc-Antoine, abbé de Montesquiou-Fezensac,
  né en 1757. Ayant embrassé l'état ecclésiastique, il fut nommé en
  1785 agent général du clergé. En 1789 le clergé de Paris l'envoya
  aux états généraux et il devint deux fois président de l'Assemblée
  en 1790. Il échappa à toute recherche sous la Terreur, fut après le
  9 thermidor un des agents nommés par Louis XVIII pour défendre sa
  cause en France. Aussi fut-il exilé à Menton sous le consulat. En
  1814 il fit partie du gouvernement provisoire, et le 13 mai fut
  nommé ministre de l'intérieur. Sous la deuxième restauration il
  demeura ministre d'État, et fut créé pair de France. Il mourut en
  1832.

  [111] Charles-Henry, vicomte Dambray, né en 1760 à Rouen, fut
  d'abord avocat au parlement. En 1788 il fut nommé avocat général à
  la cour des aides. Il ne fut pas inquiété sous la Terreur, fut en
  1795 élu député au conseil des Cinq-Cents, mais refusa de siéger.
  Sous le consulat il devint conseiller général de la
  Seine-Inférieure. En 1814, M. Dambray fut nommé chancelier garde
  des sceaux et pair de France. Sous la deuxième restauration, il ne
  conserva que ses fonctions de président de la Chambre des pairs. Il
  mourut en 1829.

  [112] Antoine-François-Claude, comte Ferrand, né en 1751 d'une
  vieille famille de robe. Il fut reçu conseiller au parlement à
  dix-huit ans. Il émigra dès le mois de septembre 1789, se rendit à
  l'armée des princes, et fit partie en 1793 du conseil de régence.
  Il rentra en France en 1801, et vécut dans la retraite en
  s'occupant d'ouvrages historiques. En 1814, il fut nommé ministre
  d'État et directeur général des postes. En 1815 il reprit ses
  fonctions, fut nommé pair de France et membre du conseil privé. Il
  mourut en 1825.

Le roi m'avait nommé ministre des affaires étrangères, et je devais en
cette qualité m'occuper des traités de paix. C'est ici le lieu de
parler de cette oeuvre difficile au sujet de laquelle j'ai été tant
attaqué et qu'il me sera aisé de défendre.

Dès le 23 avril, et avant l'arrivée du roi, j'avais dû négocier et
signer une convention préliminaire avec les plénipotentiaires des
puissances alliées.

Il faut, pour juger impartialement les transactions faites à cette
époque, se bien représenter ce qu'était la France et à quel état les
fautes de Napoléon l'avaient réduite. Épuisée d'hommes, d'argent, de
ressources; envahie sur toutes ses frontières à la fois, aux
Pyrénées, aux Alpes, au Rhin, en Belgique, par des armées
innombrables, composées en général, non de soldats mercenaires, mais
de peuples entiers animés par l'esprit de haine et de vengeance.
Depuis vingt ans ces peuples avaient vu leurs territoires occupés,
ravagés par les armées françaises; ils avaient été rançonnés de toutes
les façons; leurs gouvernements, insultés, traités avec le plus
profond mépris; il n'était sorte d'outrage, on peut le dire, qu'ils
n'eussent à venger, et s'ils étaient résolus à assouvir leurs passions
haineuses, quels moyens la France avait-elle de leur résister? Ce
n'étaient pas les derniers débris de ses armées, dispersés sur tous
les points du pays, sans cohésion entre eux et commandés par des chefs
rivaux qui n'avaient pas su toujours ployer, même sous la main de fer
de Napoléon. Il existait bien encore, il est vrai, une belle et
nombreuse armée française; mais elle était disséminée dans cinquante
forteresses échelonnées des bords de la Vistule à ceux de la Seine;
elle existait aussi dans ces masses de prisonniers retenus par nos
ennemis. Mais les forteresses étaient étroitement bloquées, les jours
de leur résistance étaient comptés et les garnisons de ces places,
comme les prisonniers, ne pouvaient être rendus à la France que par le
fait d'un traité.

C'est sous l'empire de telles circonstances que le plénipotentiaire
français devait négocier avec ceux des puissances coalisées et dans la
capitale même de la France. J'ai bien le droit, je pense, de rappeler
maintenant avec orgueil les conditions obtenues par moi, quelque
douloureuses et quelque humiliantes qu'elles aient été[113].

  [113] Voir sur la Convention du 23 avril et ses conditions
  comparées à celles qu'offraient les alliés à Châtillon une longue
  note de M. de Bacourt (Appendice IV à la fin de la septième
  partie).

Voici les termes de la convention préliminaire du 23 avril 1814
(_Moniteur_ de 1814, nº 114):

CONVENTIONS entre SON ALTESSE ROYALE MONSIEUR, fils de France, frère
du roi, lieutenant général du royaume de France, et chacune des hautes
puissances alliées, savoir: la Grande-Bretagne, la Russie, l'Autriche
et la Prusse, signées à Paris, le 23 avril 1814 et ratifiées le même
jour par MONSIEUR.

«Les puissances alliées réunies dans l'intention de mettre un terme
aux malheurs de l'Europe, et de fonder son repos sur une juste
répartition des forces entre les États qui la composent, voulant
donner à la France revenue à un gouvernement dont les principes
offrent les garanties nécessaires pour le maintien de la paix, des
preuves de leur désir de se placer avec elle dans des relations
d'amitié; voulant aussi faire jouir la France, autant que possible
d'avance, des bienfaits de la paix, même avant que toutes les
dispositions en aient été arrêtées, ont résolu de procéder
conjointement avec SON ALTESSE ROYALE MONSIEUR, fils de France, frère
du roi, lieutenant général du royaume, à une suspension d'hostilités
entre les forces respectives et au rétablissement des rapports anciens
d'amitié entre elles.

SON ALTESSE ROYALE MONSIEUR, fils de France, etc., d'une part; et Sa
Majesté, etc..., d'autre part, ont nommé, en conséquence, des
plénipotentiaires pour convenir d'un acte, lequel, sans préjuger les
dispositions de la paix, renferme les stipulations d'une suspension
d'hostilités et qui sera suivie, le plus tôt que faire se pourra, d'un
traité de paix, savoir:

(Désignation des hautes parties contractantes et de leurs
plénipotentiaires.)

»Lesquels, après l'échange de leurs pleins pouvoirs, sont convenus des
articles suivants:

»ARTICLE PREMIER.--Toutes hostilités sur terre et sur mer sont et
demeurent suspendues entre les puissances alliées et la France,
savoir: pour les armées de terre, aussitôt que les généraux commandant
les armées françaises et les places fortes auront fait connaître aux
généraux commandant les troupes alliées qui leur sont opposées, qu'ils
ont reconnu l'autorité du lieutenant général du royaume de France; et,
tant sur mer qu'à l'égard des places et stations maritimes, aussitôt
que les flottes et ports du royaume de France, ou occupés par les
troupes françaises, auront fait la même soumission.

»ARTICLE II.--Pour constater le rétablissement des rapports d'amitié
entre les puissances alliées et la France, et pour la faire jouir,
autant que possible d'avance, des avantages de la paix, les puissances
alliées feront évacuer par leurs armées le territoire français tel
qu'il se trouvait le 1er janvier 1792, à mesure que les places
occupées encore hors de ces limites par les troupes françaises seront
évacuées et remises aux alliés. (On remarquera qu'au congrès de
Châtillon, c'étaient les limites de la France en 1789, que les ennemis
imposaient à Napoléon; ainsi, par le fait de cet article II, nous
conservions le comtat d'Avignon, Landau, la Savoie, le comté de
Montbéliard[114] et d'autres territoires réunis à la France entre 1789
et 1792.)

  [114] Montbéliard était autrefois le chef-lieu d'une principauté
  indépendante, qui après avoir passé par de nombreuses mains,
  appartenait depuis 1723 aux ducs de Wurtemberg. La France s'en
  empara en 1792, et la paix de Lunéville lui assura sa conquête.

»ARTICLE III.--Le lieutenant général du royaume donnera, en
conséquence, aux commandants de ces places l'ordre de les remettre
dans les termes suivants, savoir: les places situées sur le Rhin, non
comprises dans les limites de la France du 1er janvier 1792, et celles
entre le Rhin et les mêmes limites, dans l'espace de dix jours, à
dater de la signature du présent acte; les places de Piémont, et dans
les autres parties de l'Italie, qui appartenaient à la France, dans
celui de quinze jours; celles de l'Espagne, dans celui de vingt jours;
et toutes les autres places, sans exception, qui se trouvent occupées
par les troupes françaises, de manière à ce que la remise totale
puisse être effectuée au 1er juin prochain. Les garnisons de ces
places sortiront avec armes et bagages et les propriétés particulières
des militaires et employés de tout grade. Elles pourront emmener
l'artillerie de campagne, dans la proportion de trois pièces par
chaque millier d'hommes, les malades et blessés y compris.

»La dotation des forteresses et tout ce qui n'est pas propriété
particulière demeurera, et sera remis en entier aux alliés, sans qu'il
puisse en être distrait aucun objet. Dans la dotation sont compris,
non seulement les dépôts d'artillerie et de munitions, mais encore
toutes autres provision de tout genre, ainsi que les archives,
inventaires, plans, cartes, modèles, etc.

»D'abord, après la signature de la présente convention, des
commissaires des puissances alliées et français seront nommés et
envoyés dans les forteresses pour constater l'état où elles se
trouveront et pour régler en commun l'exécution de cet article.

»Les garnisons seront dirigées, par étapes, sur les différentes lignes
dont on conviendra pour leur rentrée en France.

»Le blocus des places fortes en France sera levé sur-le-champ par les
armées alliées. Les troupes françaises faisant partie de l'armée
d'Italie, ou occupant les places fortes dans ce pays, ou dans la
Méditerranée, seront rappelées sur-le-champ par Son Altesse Royale le
lieutenant général du royaume. (Il ne faut pas oublier qu'avant que
les puissances alliées passassent le Rhin, Napoléon leur avait fait
offrir la remise des places et forteresses situées sur la Vistule et
sur l'Oder, aux conditions indiquées dans les deux premiers
paragraphes de cet article[115].)

  [115] Nous donnons la lettre suivante pour ceux qui seraient tentés
  de douter de l'assertion du prince de Talleyrand sur ce point.

  LE MAJOR GÉNÉRAL AU MARÉCHAL MARMONT.

  «Paris, le 18 novembre 1813.

  »Monsieur le maréchal, duc de Raguse, l'empereur me charge de vous
  écrire pour vous faire connaître que son intention est que vous
  envoyiez un officier intelligent auprès du prince de Schwarzenberg,
  pour offrir de traiter de la reddition de Dantzig, de Moellin, de
  Zamose, de Custrin, de Stettin et de Glogau. Les conditions de la
  reddition de ces places seraient: que les garnisons rentreraient en
  France, avec armes et bagages, sans être prisonnières de guerre; que
  toute l'artillerie de campagne aux armes françaises, ainsi que les
  magasins d'habillement qui se trouveraient dans les places, nous
  seraient laissés; que des moyens de transport pour les ramener nous
  seraient fournis; que les malades seraient guéris, et, au fur et à
  mesure de leur guérison, renvoyés. Vous ferez connaître que Dantzig
  peut tenir encore un an; que Glogau et Custrin peuvent tenir encore
  également un an; et que si l'on veut avoir ces places par un siège, on
  abîmera la ville; que ces conditions sont donc avantageuses aux
  alliés, d'autant plus que la reddition de ces places tranquillisera
  les États prussiens. Si l'on parlait de la reddition de Hambourg, de
  Magdebourg, d'Erfurt, de Torgau et de Wittenberg, Sa Majesté désire
  que vous répondiez que vous prendrez ses ordres là-dessus, mais que
  vous n'avez pas d'instructions; qu'il n'est question actuellement, que
  de traiter pour les places de l'Oder et de la Vistule. Ces
  communications, monsieur le maréchal, serviront aussi à avoir des
  nouvelles.»

  »Le prince vice-connétable, major général,

  »ALEXANDRE.»

  (_Mémoires du duc de Raguse_ t. VI, p. 75-76).

  Ajoutons que la convention du 23 avril 1814 valut à la France la
  rentrée d'une armée de deux cent cinquante mille hommes, enfermés dans
  cinquante-quatre forteresses, et de cent cinquante mille prisonniers
  de guerre. Le seul maréchal Davoust revint de Hambourg avec vingt
  mille hommes armés, cent pièces de canon et deux cents caissons;
  c'était, par conséquent, cinq pièces de canon au lieu de trois par
  mille hommes stipulées par la convention. (_Note de M. de Bacourt._)

»ARTICLE IV--Les stipulations de l'article précédent seront appliquées
également aux places maritimes, les puissances contractantes se
réservant, toutefois, de régler, dans le traité de paix définitif, le
sort des arsenaux, vaisseaux de guerre armés et non armés qui se
trouvent dans ces places.

»ARTICLE V.--Les flottes et les bâtiments de la France demeureront
dans leur situation respective, sauf la sortie des bâtiments chargés
de missions; mais l'effet immédiat du présent acte à l'égard des ports
français sera la levée de tout blocus par terre ou par mer, la liberté
de la pêche, celle du cabotage, particulièrement de celui qui est
nécessaire pour l'approvisionnement de Paris, et le rétablissement des
relations de commerce, conformément aux règlements intérieurs de
chaque pays; et cet effet immédiat à l'égard de l'intérieur sera le
libre approvisionnement des villes et le libre transit des transports
militaires ou commerciaux.

»ARTICLE VI.--Pour prévenir tous les sujets de plaintes et de
contestations qui pourraient naître à l'occasion des prises qui
seraient faites en mer après la signature de la présente convention,
il est réciproquement convenu que les vaisseaux et effets qui
pourraient être pris dans la Manche et dans les mers du Nord, après
l'espace de douze jours, à compter de l'échange des ratifications du
présent acte, seront de part et d'autre restitués; que le terme sera
d'un mois depuis la Manche et les mers du Nord jusqu'aux îles
Canaries; de deux mois jusqu'à l'équateur; et enfin de cinq mois dans
toutes les autres parties du monde, sans aucune exception ni autre
distinction plus particulière de temps et de lieu.

»ARTICLE VII.--De part et d'autre, les prisonniers, officiers et
soldats de terre et de mer, ou de quelque nature que ce soit et
particulièrement les otages, seront immédiatement renvoyés dans leurs
pays respectifs, sans rançon et sans échange. Des commissaires seront
nommés réciproquement pour procéder à cette libération générale.

»ARTICLE VIII.--Il sera fait remise par les co-belligérants,
immédiatement après la signature du présent acte, de l'administration
des départements ou villes actuellement occupés par leurs forces, aux
magistrats nommés par Son Altesse Royale le lieutenant général du
royaume de France. Les autorités royales pourvoiront aux subsistances
et aux besoins des troupes, jusqu'au moment où elles auront évacué le
territoire français, les puissances alliées voulant, par un effet de
leur amitié pour la France, faire cesser les réquisitions militaires,
aussitôt que la remise au pouvoir légitime aura été effectuée.

»Tout ce qui tient à l'exécution de cet article sera réglé par une
convention particulière. (Cet article VIII était d'une grande
importance pour mettre un terme aux réquisitions des généraux ennemis,
qui achevaient d'épuiser la France.)

»ARTICLE IX.--On s'entendra respectivement, aux termes de l'article
II sur les routes que les troupes des puissances alliées suivront dans
leur marche, pour y préparer les moyens de subsistances, et des
commissaires seront nommés pour régler toutes les dispositions de
détail, et accompagner les troupes jusqu'au moment où elles quitteront
le territoire français.

»En foi de quoi...

»Fait à Paris, le 23 avril 1814.»

«ARTICLE ADDITIONNEL.--Le terme de dix jours admis en vertu des
stipulations de l'article III de la convention de ce jour, pour
l'évacuation des places sur le Rhin, et entre ce fleuve et les
anciennes frontières de la France, est étendu aux places, forts et
établissements militaires, de quelque nature qu'ils soient, dans les
Provinces Unies des Pays-Bas.»

Par cette convention, on avait pourvu au plus urgent, qui était la
libération du territoire, celle des prisonniers, la rentrée en France
des garnisons françaises au delà du Rhin, et la cessation de ruineuses
réquisitions. Le traité définitif qui devait régler les relations
nouvelles de la France avec l'Europe restait à négocier, et il ne put
être conclu et signé que le 30 mai[116].

  [116] Le lendemain de la signature du traité, M. de Talleyrand
  adressait à la princesse de Courlande la lettre suivante:

  Paris, le 31 mai 1814.

  «J'ai fini les paix avec les quatre grandes puissances. Les trois
  accessions ne sont que des broutilles[A]. A quatre heures la paix a
  été signée. Elle est très bonne, faite sur le pied de la plus
  grande égalité, et plutôt noble, quoique la France soit encore
  couverte d'étrangers. Mes amis et vous à la tête, vous devez être
  contents de moi.»

    [A] Les accessions de l'Espagne, du Portugal et de la Suède.

Je vais insérer également ici ce traité:

TRAITÉ DE PAIX entre le roi et puissances alliées, conclu à Paris le
30 mai 1814.

«Au nom de la très sainte et indivisible Trinité,

»Sa Majesté le roi de France et de Navarre, d'une part, et Sa Majesté
l'empereur d'Autriche, roi de Hongrie et de Bohême, et ses alliés,
d'autre part, étant animés d'un égal désir de mettre fin aux longues
agitations de l'Europe et aux malheurs des peuples par une paix
solide, fondée sur une juste répartition de forces entre les
puissances, et portant dans ses stipulations la garantie de sa durée;
et Sa Majesté l'empereur d'Autriche, roi de Hongrie et de Bohême, et
ses alliés, ne voulant plus exiger de la France, aujourd'hui que
s'étant replacée sous le gouvernement paternel de ses rois, elle offre
ainsi à l'Europe un gage de sécurité et de stabilité, des conditions
et des garanties qu'ils lui avaient à regret demandées sous son
dernier gouvernement, Leursdites Majestés ont nommé des
plénipotentiaires pour discuter, arrêter et signer un traité de paix
et d'amitié, savoir:

»Sa Majesté le roi de France et de Navarre, M. Charles-Maurice de
Talleyrand-Périgord, prince de Bénévent, grand-aigle de la Légion
d'honneur... son ministre et secrétaire d'État des affaires
étrangères;

»Et Sa Majesté l'empereur d'Autriche, roi de Hongrie et
de Bohême, MM. le prince Clément-Wenceslas-Lothaire de
Metternich-Winnebourg-Ochsenhausen, chevalier de la Toison d'or...
chambellan, conseiller intime actuel, ministre d'État, des conférences
et des affaires étrangères de Sa Majesté impériale et royale
apostolique, et le comte Jean-Philippe de Stadion Thannhausen et
Warthausen, chevalier de la Toison d'or... chambellan, conseiller
intime actuel, ministre d'État et des conférences de Sa Majesté
Impériale et Royale apostolique;

»Lesquels, après avoir échangé leurs pleins pouvoirs, trouvés en bonne
et due forme, sont convenus des articles suivants:

»ARTICLE PREMIER.--Il y aura, à compter de ce jour, paix et amitié
entre Sa Majesté le roi de France et de Navarre d'une part, et Sa
Majesté l'empereur d'Autriche, roi de Hongrie et de Bohême, et ses
alliés, de l'autre part, leurs héritiers et successeurs, leurs États
et sujets respectifs à perpétuité.

»Les hautes parties contractantes apporteront tous leurs soins à
maintenir, non seulement entre elles, mais encore, autant qu'il dépend
d'elles, entre tous les États de l'Europe, la bonne harmonie et
intelligence si nécessaires à son repos.

»ARTICLE II.--Le royaume de France conserve l'intégrité de ses limites
telles qu'elles existaient à l'époque du 1er janvier 1792. Il recevra
en outre une augmentation de territoire comprise dans la ligne de
démarcation fixée par l'article suivant.

»ARTICLE III.--Du côté de la Belgique, de l'Allemagne et de l'Italie,
l'ancienne frontière, ainsi qu'elle existait le 1er janvier 1792, sera
rétablie, en commençant de la mer du Nord, entre Dunkerque et Neuport,
jusqu'à la Méditerranée, entre Cannes et Nice, avec les rectifications
suivantes:

»1º Dans le département de Jemmapes, les cantons de Dour,
Merbes-le-Château, Beaumont et Chimay resteront à la France; la ligne
de démarcation passera là où elle touche le canton de Dour, entre ce
canton et ceux de Boussu et Pâturage, ainsi que plus loin entre celui
de Merbes-le-Château et ceux de Binch et de Thuin;

»2º Dans le département de Sambre-et-Meuse, les cantons de Valcourt,
Florennes, Beauraing et Gédinne appartiendront à la France; la
démarcation, quand elle atteint ce département, suivra la ligne qui
sépare les cantons précités du département de Jemmapes et du reste de
celui de Sambre-et-Meuse;

»3º Dans le département de la Moselle, la nouvelle démarcation, là où
elle s'écarte de l'ancienne, sera formée par une ligne à tirer depuis
Perle jusqu'à Fremesdorf, et par celle qui sépare le canton de Tholey
du reste du département de la Moselle;

»4º Dans le département de la Sarre, les cantons de Saarbruck et
d'Arneval resteront à la France, ainsi que la partie de celui de
Lebach qui est située au midi d'une ligne à tirer le long des confins
des villages de Herchenbach, Ueberhofen, Hilsbach et Hall (en laissant
ces différents endroits hors de la frontière française), jusqu'au
point où, près de Querselle (qui appartient à la France), la ligne qui
sépare les cantons d'Arneval et d'Ottweiler atteint celle qui sépare
ceux d'Arneval et de Lebach; la frontière, de ce côté, sera formée par
la ligne ci-dessus désignée, et ensuite par celle qui sépare le canton
d'Arneval de celui de Bliecastel;

»5º La forteresse de Landau ayant formé avant l'année 1792, un point
isolé dans l'Allemagne, la France conserve au delà de ses frontières
une partie des départements du Mont-Tonnerre et du Bas-Rhin, pour
joindre la forteresse de Landau et son rayon au reste du royaume. La
nouvelle démarcation en partant du point où, près d'Obersteinbach (qui
reste hors des limites de la France) la frontière entre le département
de la Moselle et celui du Mont-Tonnerre, atteint le département du
Bas-Rhin, suivra la ligne qui sépare les cantons de Weissenbourg et
de Bergzabern (du côté de la France) des cantons de Pirmasens, Dalm et
Anweiler (du côté de l'Allemagne) jusqu'au point où ces limites, près
du village de Wolmersheim, touchent l'ancien rayon de la forteresse de
Landau. De ce rayon qui reste ainsi qu'il était en 1792, la nouvelle
frontière suivra le bras de la rivière de la Queich qui, en quittant
ce rayon près de Queichheim (qui reste à la France) passe près des
villages de Merlenheim, Knittelsheim et Belheim (demeurant également
français) jusqu'au Rhin, qui continuera ensuite à former la limite de
la France et de l'Allemagne.

»Quant au Rhin, le thalweg constituera la limite, de manière cependant
que les changements que subira par la suite le cours de ce fleuve,
n'auront à l'avenir aucun effet sur la propriété des îles qui s'y
trouvent. L'état de possession de ces îles sera rétabli tel qu'il
existait à l'époque de la signature du traité de Lunéville;

»6º Dans le département du Doubs, la frontière sera rectifiée de
manière à ce qu'elle commence au-dessus de la Rançonnière, près de
Locle, et suive la crête du Jura, entre le Cerneux-Péquignot et le
village de Fontenelles, jusqu'à une cime du Jura située à environ sept
ou huit mille pieds au nord-ouest du village de la Brévine, où elle
retombera dans l'ancienne limite de la France;

»7º Dans le département du Léman, les frontières entre le territoire
français, le pays de Vaud et les différentes portions du territoire de
la république de Genève (qui fera partie de la Suisse) restent les
mêmes qu'elles étaient avant l'incorporation de Genève à la France.
Mais le canton de Frangy, celui de Saint-Julien (à l'exception de la
partie située au nord d'une ligne à tirer du point où la rivière de
la Laire entre, près de Chancy, dans le territoire genevois, le long
des confins de Seseguin, Lacouex et Seseneuve qui resteront hors des
limites de la France), le canton de Régnier (à l'exception de la
portion qui se trouve à l'est d'une ligne qui suit les confins de la
Muraz, Bussy, Pers et Cornier qui seront hors des limites françaises),
et le canton de la Roche (à l'exception des endroits nommés la Roche
et Armanoy avec leurs districts) resteront à la France. La frontière
suivra les limites de ces différents cantons et les lignes qui
séparent les portions qui demeurent à la France de celles qu'elle ne
conserve pas;

»8º Dans le département du Mont-Blanc, la France acquiert la
sous-préfecture de Chambéry (à l'exception des cantons de l'Hôpital,
de Saint-Pierre-d'Albigny, de la Rocette et de Montmélian) et la
sous-préfecture d'Annecy (à l'exception de la partie du canton de
Faverge, située à l'est d'une ligne qui passe entre Ourechaise et
Marlens du côté de la France, et Marthod et Ugine du côté opposé, et
qui suit après la crête des montagnes jusqu'à la frontière du canton
de Thones): c'est cette ligne qui, avec la limite des cantons
mentionnés formera de ce côté la nouvelle frontière.

»Du côté des Pyrénées, les frontières restent telles qu'elles étaient
entre les deux royaumes de France et d'Espagne, à l'époque du 1er
janvier 1792, et il sera de suite nommé une commission mixte de la
part des deux couronnes, pour en fixer la démarcation finale.

»La France renonce à tous droits de souveraineté, de suzeraineté et de
possession sur tous les pays et districts, villes et endroits
quelconques, situés hors de la frontière ci-dessus désignée, la
principauté de Monaco étant toutefois replacée dans les rapports où
elle se trouvait avant le 1er janvier 1792[117].

  [117] La principauté de Monaco était avant la Révolution sous le
  protectorat de la France (traité de Péronne 1641). En 1793 elle
  avait été réunie à la France. Le traité de 1814 la rétablit dans
  son indépendance tout en proclamant le protectorat français, mais
  en 1815 la France perdit ce droit qui fut attribué à la Sardaigne.
  Celle-ci le conserva jusqu'en 1860.

»Les cours alliées assurent à la France la possession de la
principauté d'Avignon, du comtat venaissin, du comté de Montbéliard et
de toutes les enclaves qui ont appartenu autrefois à l'Allemagne,
comprises dans la frontière ci-dessus indiquée, qu'elles aient été
incorporées à la France avant ou après le 1er janvier 1792.

»Les puissances se réservent réciproquement la faculté entière de
fortifier tel point de leurs États qu'elles jugeront convenable pour
leur sûreté.

»Pour éviter toute lésion de propriétés particulières et mettre à
couvert, d'après les principes les plus libéraux, les biens
d'individus domiciliés sur les frontières, il sera nommé par chacun
des États limitrophes de la France, des commissaires pour procéder
conjointement avec des commissaires français à la délimitation des
pays respectifs.

»Aussitôt que le travail des commissaires sera terminé, il sera dressé
des cartes signées par les commissaires respectifs, et placé des
poteaux qui constateront les limites réciproques.

»ARTICLE IV.--Pour assurer les communications de la ville de Genève
avec d'autres parties du territoire de la Suisse, situées sur le lac,
la France consent à ce que l'usage de la route par Versoy soit commun
aux deux pays. Les gouvernements respectifs s'entendront à l'amiable
sur les moyens de prévenir la contrebande, et de régler le cours des
postes et l'entretien de la route.

»ARTICLE V.--La navigation sur le Rhin, du point où il devient
navigable, jusqu'à la mer, et réciproquement, sera libre; de telle
sorte qu'elle ne puisse être interdite à personne; et l'on s'occupera
au futur congrès, des principes d'après lesquels on pourra régler les
droits à lever par les États riverains, de la manière la plus égale et
la plus favorable au commerce de toutes les nations.

»Il sera examiné et décidé, de même dans le futur congrès, de quelle
manière, pour faciliter les communications entre les peuples et les
rendre toujours moins étrangers les uns aux autres, la disposition
ci-dessus pourra être également étendue à tous les autres fleuves qui,
dans leur cours navigable, séparent ou traversent différents États.

»ARTICLE VI.--La Hollande, placée sous la souveraineté de la maison
d'Orange, recevra un accroissement de territoire. Le titre et
l'exercice de la souveraineté n'y pourront, dans aucun cas, appartenir
à aucun prince portant ou appelé à porter une couronne étrangère.

»Les États de l'Allemagne seront indépendants et unis par un lien
fédératif.

»La Suisse indépendante continuera de se gouverner par elle-même.

»L'Italie, hors des limites qui reviendront à l'Autriche, sera
composée d'États souverains.

»ARTICLE VII.--L'île de Malte et ses dépendances appartiendront en
toute propriété et souveraineté à Sa Majesté britannique.

»ARTICLE VIII.--Sa Majesté britannique stipulant pour elle et ses
alliés, s'engage à restituer à Sa Majesté Très Chrétienne, dans les
délais qui seront ci-après fixés, les colonies, pêcheries, comptoirs
et établissements de tout genre que la France possédait au 1er janvier
1792, dans les mers et sur les continents de l'Amérique, de l'Afrique
et de l'Asie, à l'exception toutefois des îles de Tabago et de
Sainte-Lucie et de l'île de France et de ses dépendances, nommément
Rodrigue et les Séchelles, lesquelles Sa Majesté Très Chrétienne cède
en toute propriété et souveraineté à Sa Majesté britannique, comme
aussi de la partie de Saint-Domingue, cédée à la France par la paix de
Bâle, et que Sa Majesté Très Chrétienne rétrocède à Sa Majesté
catholique en toute propriété et souveraineté.

»ARTICLE IX.--Sa Majesté le roi de Suède et de Norvège, en conséquence
d'arrangements pris avec ses alliés, et pour l'exécution de l'article
précédent, consent à ce que l'île de la Guadeloupe soit restituée à Sa
Majesté Très Chrétienne, et cède tous les droits qu'il peut avoir sur
cette île[118].

  [118] Les Anglais s'étaient emparés de la Guadeloupe et l'avaient
  cédée à la Suède (art. IV du traité du 3 mars 1813).

»ARTICLE X.--Sa Majesté très fidèle, en conséquence d'arrangements
pris avec ses alliés, et pour l'exécution de l'article VIII, s'engage
à restituer à Sa Majesté Très Chrétienne, dans le délai ci-après fixé,
la Guyane française, telle qu'elle existait au 1er janvier 1792[119].

  [119] Les Portugais s'étaient emparés de la Guyane française dès le
  début des hostilités, en 1809.

»L'effet de la stipulation ci-dessus, étant de faire revivre la
contestation existant à cette époque au sujet des limites, il est
convenu que cette contestation sera terminée par un arrangement
amiable entre les deux cours, sous la médiation de Sa Majesté
britannique[120].

  [120] On sait que cette question de limites n'a jamais été réglée
  définitivement; aujourd'hui encore, elle est en suspens entre la
  France et le Brésil.

»ARTICLE XI.--Les places et forts existants dans les colonies et
établissements qui doivent être rendus à Sa Majesté Très Chrétienne,
en vertu des articles VIII, IX et X, seront remis, dans l'état où ils
se trouveront au moment de la signature du présent traité.

»ARTICLE XII.--Sa Majesté britannique s'engage à faire jouir les
sujets de Sa Majesté Très Chrétienne, relativement au commerce et à la
sûreté de leurs personnes et propriétés dans les limites de la
souveraineté britannique, sur le continent des Indes, des mêmes
facilités, privilèges et protection, qui sont à présent, ou seront
accordés aux nations les plus favorisées. De son côté Sa Majesté Très
Chrétienne, n'ayant rien plus à coeur que la perpétuité de la paix
entre les deux couronnes de France et d'Angleterre, et voulant
contribuer, autant qu'il est en elle, à écarter dès à présent des
rapports des deux peuples ce qui pourrait un jour altérer la bonne
intelligence mutuelle, s'engage à ne faire aucun ouvrage de
fortification dans les établissements qui lui doivent être restitués
et qui sont situés dans les limites de la souveraineté britannique sur
le continent des Indes, et à ne mettre dans ces établissements que le
nombre de troupes nécessaires pour le maintien de la police.

»ARTICLE XIII.--Quant au droit de pêche des Français sur le grand banc
de Terre-Neuve, sur les côtes de l'île de ce nom et des îles
adjacentes, et dans le golfe de Saint Laurent, tout sera remis sur le
même pied qu'en 1792.

»ARTICLE XIV.--Les colonies, comptoirs et établissements qui doivent
être restitués à Sa Majesté Très Chrétienne, par Sa Majesté
britannique ou ses alliés, seront remis, savoir: ceux qui sont dans
les mers du Nord ou dans les mers et sur les continents de l'Amérique
et de l'Afrique, dans les trois mois; et ceux qui sont au delà du cap
de Bonne-Espérance, dans les six mois qui suivront la ratification du
présent traité.

»ARTICLE XV.--Les hautes parties contractantes s'étant réservé par
l'article IV de la convention du 23 avril dernier, de régler dans le
présent traité de paix définitive le sort des arsenaux et des
vaisseaux de guerre armés et non armés qui se trouvent dans les places
maritimes remises par la France, en exécution de l'article II de
ladite convention, il est convenu que lesdits vaisseaux et bâtiments
de guerre armés et non armés, comme aussi l'artillerie navale et les
munitions navales et tous les matériaux de construction et d'armement,
seront partagés entre la France et le pays où les places sont situées,
dans la proportion de deux tiers pour la France et d'un tiers pour les
puissances auxquelles lesdites places appartiendront.

»Seront considérés comme matériaux et partagés comme tels, dans la
proportion ci-dessus énoncée, après avoir été démolis, les vaisseaux
et bâtiments en construction qui ne seraient pas en état d'être mis en
mer, six semaines après la signature du présent traité.

»Des commissaires seront nommés de part et d'autre pour arrêter le
partage et en dresser l'état; et des passeports ou sauf-conduits
seront donnés par les puissances alliées pour assurer le retour en
France des ouvriers, gens de mer et employés français.

»Ne sont compris dans les stipulations ci-dessus les vaisseaux et
arsenaux existant dans les places maritimes qui seraient tombées au
pouvoir des alliés antérieurement au 23 avril, ni les vaisseaux et
arsenaux qui appartenaient à la Hollande, et nommément la flotte du
Texel.

»Le gouvernement de France s'oblige à retirer ou à faire vendre tout
ce qui lui appartiendra par les stipulations ci-dessus énoncées, dans
le délai de trois mois après le partage effectué.

»Dorénavant le port d'Anvers sera uniquement un port de commerce.

»ARTICLE XVI.--Les hautes parties contractantes, voulant mettre et
faire mettre dans un entier oubli les divisions qui ont agité
l'Europe, déclarent et promettent, que, dans les pays restitués et
cédés par le présent traité, aucun individu, de quelque classe et
condition qu'il soit, ne pourra être poursuivi, inquiété ou troublé,
dans sa personne ou dans sa propriété, sous aucun prétexte, ou à cause
de sa conduite ou opinion politique, ou de son attachement, soit à
aucune des parties contractantes, soit à des gouvernements qui ont
cessé d'exister, ou pour toute autre raison, si ce n'est pour les
dettes contractées envers des individus, ou pour des actes postérieurs
au présent traité.

»ARTICLE XVII.--Dans tous les pays qui doivent ou devront changer de
maîtres, tant en vertu du présent traité, que des arrangements qui
doivent être faits en conséquence, il sera accordé aux habitants
naturels et étrangers, de quelque condition et nation qu'ils soient,
un espace de six ans à compter de l'échange des ratifications, pour
disposer, s'ils le jugent convenable, de leurs propriétés acquises,
soit avant, soit depuis la guerre actuelle, et se retirer dans tel
pays qu'il leur plaira de choisir.

»ARTICLE XVIII.--Les puissances alliées, voulant donner à Sa Majesté
Très Chrétienne, un nouveau témoignage de leur désir de faire
disparaître, autant qu'il est en elles, les conséquences de l'époque
de malheur si heureusement terminée par la présente paix, renoncent à
la totalité des sommes que les gouvernements ont à réclamer de la
France, à raison de contrats, de fournitures ou d'avances quelconques
faites au gouvernement français dans les différentes guerres qui ont
eu lieu depuis 1792.

»De son côté Sa Majesté Très Chrétienne, renonce à toute réclamation
qu'elle pourrait former contre les puissances alliées au même titre.
En exécution de cet article, les hautes parties contractantes
s'engagent à se remettre mutuellement tous les titres, obligations et
documents qui ont rapport aux créances auxquelles elles ont
réciproquement renoncé.

»ARTICLE XIX.--Le gouvernement français s'engage à faire liquider et
payer les sommes qu'il se trouverait devoir d'ailleurs dans des pays
hors de son territoire, en vertu de contrats ou d'autres engagements
formels passés entre des individus ou des établissements particuliers
et les autorités françaises, tant pour fournitures qu'à raison
d'obligations légales.

»ARTICLE XX.--Les hautes parties contractantes nommeront immédiatement
après l'échange des ratifications du présent traité, des commissaires
pour régler et tenir la main à l'exécution de l'ensemble des
dispositions renfermées dans les articles XVIII et XIX. Ces
commissaires s'occuperont de l'examen des réclamations dont il est
parlé dans l'article précédent, de la liquidation des sommes
réclamées, et du mode dont le gouvernement français proposera de s'en
acquitter. Ils seront chargés de même de la remise des titres,
obligations et documents relatifs aux créances auxquelles les hautes
parties contractantes renoncent mutuellement, de manière que la
ratification du résultat de leur travail, complétera cette
renonciation réciproque.

»ARTICLE XXI.--Les dettes spécialement hypothéquées dans leur origine
sur les pays qui cessent d'appartenir à la France, ou contractées pour
leur administration intérieure, resteront à la charge de ces mêmes
pays. Il sera tenu compte, en conséquence, au gouvernement français, à
partie du 22 décembre 1813, de celles de ces dettes qui ont été
converties en inscriptions au grand livre de la dette publique de
France. Les titres de toutes celles qui ont été préparées pour
l'inscription et n'ont pas encore été inscrites seront remis aux
gouvernements des pays respectifs. Les états de toutes ces dettes
seront dressés et arrêtés par une commission mixte.

»ARTICLE XXII.--Le gouvernement français restera chargé de son côté du
remboursement de toutes les sommes versées par les sujets des pays
ci-dessus mentionnés dans les caisses françaises, soit à titre de
cautionnements, de dépôts ou de consignations. De même les sujets
français, serviteurs desdits pays, qui ont versé des sommes à titre de
cautionnements, dépôts ou consignations dans leurs trésors respectifs,
seront fidèlement remboursés.

»ARTICLE XXIII.--Les titulaires de places assujetties à cautionnement,
qui n'ont pas de maniement de deniers, seront remboursés avec les
intérêts, jusqu'à parfait payement, à Paris, par cinquième et par
année, à partir de la date du présent traité.

»A l'égard de ceux qui sont comptables, ce remboursement commencera,
au plus tard, six mois après la présentation de leurs comptes, le seul
cas de malversation excepté. Une copie du dernier compte sera remise
au gouvernement de leur pays, pour lui servir de renseignement et de
point de départ.

»ARTICLE XXIV.--Les dépôts judiciaires et consignations faits dans la
caisse d'amortissement, en exécution de la loi du 28 nivôse an XIII
(18 janvier 1805), et qui appartiennent à des habitants des pays que
la France cesse de posséder, seront remis, dans le terme d'une année,
à compter de l'échange des ratifications du présent traité, entre les
mains des autorités desdits pays, à l'exception de ceux de ces dépôts
et consignations qui intéressent des sujets français; dans lequel cas
ils resteront dans la caisse d'amortissement, pour n'être remis que
sur les justifications résultant des décisions des autorités
compétentes.

»ARTICLE XXV.--Les fonds déposés par les communes et établissements
publics dans la caisse de service et dans la caisse d'amortissement,
ou dans toute autre caisse du gouvernement, leur seront remboursés par
cinquième, d'année en année, à partir de la date du présent traité,
sous la déduction des avances qui leur auraient été faites, et sauf
des oppositions régulières faites sur ces fonds par des créanciers
desdites communes et desdits établissements publics.

»ARTICLE XXVI.--A dater du 1er janvier 1814, le gouvernement français
cesse d'être chargé du payement de toute pension civile, militaire et
ecclésiastique, solde de retraite et traitement de réforme, à tout
individu qui se trouve n'être plus sujet français.

»ARTICLE XXVII.--Les domaines nationaux acquis à titre onéreux par des
sujets français, dans les ci-devant départements de la Belgique, de
la rive gauche du Rhin et des Alpes, hors des anciennes limites de la
France, sont et demeurent garantis aux acquéreurs.

»ARTICLE XXVIII.--L'abolition des droits d'aubaine, de détraction et
autres de la même nature, dans les pays qui l'ont réciproquement
stipulée avec la France, ou qui lui avaient précédemment été réunis,
est expressément maintenue[121]

  [121] Le droit d'aubaine, tel qu'il existait dans notre ancien
  droit, attribuait au souverain la succession de tous les étrangers
  morts en France. Mais de nombreux traités conclus avec presque
  toutes les puissances de l'Europe avaient notamment dans le cours
  du XVIIIe siècle aboli purement et simplement ce droit, à charge de
  réciprocité, ou l'avaient remplacé par un simple droit de
  détraction, qui ne laissait au roi qu'une partie de la succession
  (du quart au vingtième). L'Assemblée nationale abolit entièrement
  ces deux droits (décrets du 6 août 1790, 15 et 28 avril 1791). Une
  loi du 14 juillet 1819 vint confirmer et compléter cette réforme
  sur laquelle avaient paru revenir certaines dispositions du code
  civil (art. 726 et 912).

»ARTICLE XXIX.--Le gouvernement français s'engage à faire restituer
les obligations et autres titres qui auraient été saisis dans les
provinces occupées par les armées ou administrations française; et,
dans le cas où la restitution ne pourrait en être effectuée, ces
obligations et titres sont et demeurent anéantis.

»ARTICLE XXX.--Les sommes qui seront dues pour tous les travaux
d'utilité publique, non encore terminés, ou terminés postérieurement
au 31 décembre 1812, sur le Rhin et dans les départements détachés de
la France par le présent traité, passeront à la charge des futurs
possesseurs du territoire, et seront liquidées par la commission
chargée de la liquidation des dettes des pays.

»ARTICLE XXXI.--Les archives, cartes, plans et documents quelconques
appartenant aux pays cédés, ou concernant leur administration, seront
fidèlement rendus en même temps que le pays, ou, si cela était
impossible, dans un délai qui ne pourra être de plus de six mois après
la remise des pays mêmes.

»Cette stipulation est applicable aux archives, cartes et planches qui
pourraient avoir été enlevées dans les pays momentanément occupés par
les différentes armées.

»ARTICLE XXXII.--Dans le délai de deux mois, toutes les puissances qui
ont été engagées de part et d'autre dans la présente guerre enverront
des plénipotentiaires à Vienne, pour régler dans un congrès général
les arrangements qui doivent compléter les dispositions du présent
traité.

»ARTICLE XXXIII.--Le présent traité sera ratifié, et les ratifications
en seront échangées, dans le délai de quinze jours, ou plus tôt si
faire se peut.

»En foi de quoi....

»Fait à Paris le 30 mai 1814.

  »Le prince DE BÉNÉVENT,
  »Le prince DE METTERNICH,
  »Le prince DE STADION.»

«ARTICLE ADDITIONNEL.--Les hautes parties contractantes, voulant
effacer toutes les traces des événements malheureux qui ont pesé sur
leurs peuples, sont convenues d'annuler explicitement les effets des
traités de 1805 et 1809, en tant qu'ils ne sont déjà annulés de fait
par le présent traité; en conséquence de cette détermination, Sa
Majesté Très Chrétienne promet que les décrets portés contre des
sujets français ou réputés français, étant ou ayant été au service de
Sa Majesté Impériale et Royale apostolique, demeureront sans effet,

ARTICLES ADDITIONNELS AU TRAITÉ AVEC LA GRANDE-BRETAGNE.

«ARTICLE PREMIER.--Sa Majesté Très Chrétienne, partageant sans réserve
tous les sentiments de Sa Majesté britannique, relativement à un
genre de commerce que repoussent, et les principes de la justice
naturelle et les lumières des temps où nous vivons, s'engage à unir,
au futur congrès, tous ses efforts à ceux de Sa Majesté britannique,
pour faire prononcer par toutes les puissances de la chrétienté
l'abolition de la traite des noirs, de telle sorte que ladite traite
cesse universellement, comme elle cessera définitivement et, dans tous
les cas, de la part de la France, dans un délai de cinq années; et
qu'en outre, pendant la durée de ce délai, aucun trafiquant d'esclaves
n'en puisse importer ni vendre ailleurs que dans les colonies de
l'État dont il est sujet.

»ARTICLE II.--Le gouvernement britannique et le gouvernement français
nommeront incessamment des commissaires pour liquider leurs dépenses
respectives pour l'entretien des prisonniers de guerre, afin de
s'arranger sur la manière d'acquitter l'excédent qui se trouverait en
faveur de l'une ou de l'autre des deux puissances.

»ARTICLE III.--Les prisonniers de guerre respectifs seront tenus
d'acquitter, avant leur départ du lieu de leur détention, les dettes
particulières qu'ils pourraient y avoir contractées ou de donner au
moins caution satisfaisante.

»ARTICLE IV.--Il sera accordé de part et d'autre, aussitôt après la
ratification du présente traité de paix, main-levée du séquestre qui
aurait été mis depuis l'an 1792 sur les fonds, revenus, créances et
autres effets quelconques des hautes parties contractantes ou de leurs
sujets.

»Les mêmes commissaires dont il est fait mention à l'article II,
s'occuperont de l'examen et de la liquidation des réclamations des
sujets de Sa Majesté britannique envers le gouvernement français pour
la valeur des biens meubles ou immeubles indûment confisqués par les
autorités françaises, ainsi que pour la perte totale ou partielle de
leurs créances ou autres propriétés, indûment retenues sous le
séquestre depuis l'année 1792.

»La France s'engage à traiter à cet égard les sujets anglais avec la
même justice que les sujets français ont éprouvée en Angleterre; et le
gouvernement anglais, désirant concourir pour sa part au nouveau
témoignage que les puissances alliées ont voulu donner à Sa Majesté
Très Chrétienne, de leur désir de faire disparaître les conséquences
de l'époque de malheur si heureusement terminée par la présente paix,
s'engage, de son côté, à renoncer, dès que justice complète sera
rendue à ses sujets, à la totalité de l'excédent qui se trouverait en
sa faveur, relativement à l'entretien des prisonniers de guerre, de
manière que la ratification du résultat du travail des commissaires
sus-mentionnés, et l'acquit des sommes, ainsi que la restitution des
effets qui seront jugés appartenir aux sujets de Sa Majesté
britannique, compléteront sa renonciation.

»ARTICLE V.--Les deux hautes parties contractantes, désirant établir
les relations les plus amicales entre leurs sujets respectifs, se
réservent et promettent de s'entendre et de s'arranger le plus tôt que
faire se pourra sur leurs intérêts commerciaux, dans l'intérêt

depuis la paix de Bâle, entre la Prusse et la France soient déjà
annulés de fait par le présent traité, les hautes parties
contractantes ont jugé néanmoins à propos de déclarer expressément que

articles séparés et secrets de ce traité, auxquels j'avais dû
consentir, et qui en formaient la partie peut-être la plus fâcheuse

ARTICLES SÉPARÉS ET SECRETS DU TRAITÉ DE PARIS DU 30 MAI 1814.

»La disposition à faire des territoires auxquels Sa Majesté Très
Chrétienne renonce par l'article III du traité patent de ce jour, et
les rapports desquels doit résulter un système d'équilibre réel et
durable en Europe, seront réglés au congrès sur les bases arrêtées par
les puissances alliées _entre elles_, et d'après les dispositions
générales contenues dans les articles suivants:

»ARTICLE PREMIER.--L'établissement d'un juste équilibre en Europe,
exigeant que la Hollande soit constituée dans des proportions qui la
mettent à même de soutenir son indépendance par ses propres moyens,
les pays compris entre la mer, les frontières de la France, telles
qu'elles se trouvent réglées par le présent traité, et la Meuse,
seront réunis à toute perpétuité à la Hollande.

»ARTICLE II.--Les frontières de la rive droite de la Meuse seront
réglées selon les convenances militaires de la Hollande et de ses
voisins.

»ARTICLE III.--La liberté de navigation sur l'Escaut sera établie sur
le même principe qui a réglé la navigation du Rhin dans l'article V du
traité patent de ce jour.

»ARTICLE IV.--Les pays allemands sur la rive gauche du Rhin, qui
avaient été réunis à la France depuis 1792, serviront à
l'agrandissement de la Hollande et à des compensations pour la Prusse
et autres États allemands.»

       *       *       *       *       *

Quand je pense à la date de ces traités de 1814, aux difficultés de
tout genre que j'ai éprouvées, à l'esprit de vengeance que je
rencontrai dans quelques-uns des négociateurs avec lesquels je
traitais, et que j'étais obligé de combattre, j'attends avec confiance
le jugement que la postérité en portera. Je me bornerai à rappeler que
six semaines après l'entrée du roi à Paris, la France avait son
territoire assuré; les soldats étrangers avaient quitté le sol
français; par la rentrée des garnisons des places fortes et des
prisonniers, elle possédait une superbe armée, et enfin nous avions
conservé tous ces admirables objets d'art conquis par nos armes dans
presque tous les musées de l'Europe.

Si de nouveaux désastres sont venus accabler la France en 1815, et lui
faire perdre les fruits des traités de 1814, c'est encore Napoléon
seul qui fut le coupable, et qui mérita l'exécration de son pays, en
attirant sur lui d'irréparables fléaux.

Le traité de Paris, en ôtant à la France les pays immenses que la
conquête avait précédemment mis entre ses mains, rendait
indispensables des arrangements ultérieurs pour disposer de ces
territoires. Plusieurs souverains, tels que le roi de Sardaigne[122],
l'électeur de Hanovre[123], celui de Hesse-Cassel, étaient rentrés
dans les États qui leur avaient été enlevés par la guerre, aussitôt
que ces États s'étaient trouvés délivrés. Mais le sort de beaucoup des
pays abandonnés par la France restait à décider. Il y avait aussi à
prononcer sur celui du roi de Saxe; que les puissances alliées
poursuivaient de leur haine, à cause de sa fidélité à la cause de
Napoléon; sur le duché de Varsovie, pris, non à la France, mais à son
allié le roi de Saxe, et enfin sur le royaume de Naples, que la
politique de la France, aussi bien que la volonté de Louis XVIII,
inébranlable sur ce point, ne pouvait évidemment pas laisser entre les
mains de Murat.

  [122] Victor-Emmanuel Ier, deuxième fils de Victor-Amédée III. Né
  en 1759, il succéda en 1802 à son frère Charles-Emmanuel qui avait
  abdiqué. Jusqu'en 1814, il ne régna que sur l'île de Sardaigne.
  Ayant alors recouvré ses États, il régna jusqu'en 1821, dut alors
  abdiquer devant une insurrection, céda le trône à son frère
  Charles-Félix, et mourut en 1824.

  [123] George III, roi d'Angleterre, recouvra en 1814 son électorat
  de Hanovre qui fut érigé en royaume et accru de divers territoires.

On a vu que, par le traité, il avait été convenu que toutes les
dispositions à faire seraient arrêtées dans un congrès qui se
réunirait à Vienne. Une des stipulations du traité était que la
Hollande, placée sous la souveraineté de la maison d'Orange, recevrait
un accroissement de territoire qui ne pouvait être pris qu'en
Belgique; c'était le résultat d'une promesse faite par l'Angleterre
qui voulait avoir le port d'Anvers dans sa dépendance, et empêcher
qu'il ne devînt un port militaire. Le roi de Sardaigne devait aussi
recevoir une augmentation de territoire prise sur l'ancien État de
Gênes, car les cabinets alliés ne songeaient pas plus que Napoléon à
rétablir les anciennes républiques, ébranlées ou détruites déjà par la
République française.

Les États d'Allemagne qui avaient survécu à la dissolution de l'empire
germanique, et ceux d'Italie (à l'exception des pays qui
appartiendraient à l'empereur d'Autriche) devenus indépendants,
devaient continuer à l'être. Du reste, le traité ne déterminait rien
sur les autres partages et dispositions de territoires. Il se bornait
à dire que les arrangements territoriaux et autres devraient être
faits de manière à ce qu'il en résultât un _équilibre réel et
durable_. Ces mots d'_équilibre réel et durable_ étaient bien vagues,
et ne pouvaient manquer d'ouvrir un vaste champ à des discussions dont
il était à peu près impossible de prévoir l'issue. Car, ni la
direction que devaient prendre les négociations du congrès, ni
l'esprit qui devait présider à ses travaux, n'étaient déterminés
d'avance par des principes fixes. Si quelques points étaient décidés,
c'était par des clauses relatives à des cas particuliers.

Dans un tel état de choses, le rôle de la France était singulièrement
difficile. Il était bien tentant et bien aisé, pour des cabinets
aigris depuis si longtemps, de la tenir à l'écart des grands intérêts
de l'Europe. Par le traité de Paris, la France avait échappé à la
destruction; mais elle n'avait pas repris dans le système de politique
générale le rang qu'elle est appelée à occuper. Des yeux exercés
découvraient aisément dans plusieurs des principaux plénipotentiaires
le secret désir de la réduire à un rôle secondaire; et les articles
secrets du traité prononçaient que le partage des territoires repris à
la France se ferait _entre les puissances_, c'est-à-dire à l'exclusion
de la France. Si donc la France ne marquait pas elle-même, dès le
début du congrès, la place que lui assignaient les souvenirs de sa
puissance et la générosité momentanée de quelques-uns des souverains
alliés, elle devait se résigner à rester longtemps étrangère aux
transactions de l'Europe, et exposée à l'effet des alliances que ses
succès, dont elle avait tant abusé, avaient fait contracter, et que la
jalousie pouvait faire renouveler. En un mot, elle perdait l'espoir de
tracer entre l'empire de Napoléon et la restauration cette profonde
ligne de séparation, qui devait interdire aux cabinets de l'Europe de
demander compte à la France régénérée, des excès et des violences de
la France révolutionnaire.

Il fallait un négociateur bien convaincu de l'importance des
circonstances, bien pénétré des moyens qui avaient contribué aux
changements opérés en France, et qui fût en position de faire entendre
un langage vrai et ferme aux cabinets qu'il était difficile de
distraire de l'idée qu'ils avaient triomphé. Il fallait surtout que le
plénipotentiaire français comprît et fît comprendre que la France ne
voulait que ce qu'elle avait; que c'était franchement qu'elle avait
répudié l'héritage de la conquête; qu'elle se trouvait assez forte
dans ses anciennes limites; qu'elle n'avait pas la pensée de les
étendre; qu'enfin, elle plaçait aujourd'hui sa gloire dans sa
modération; mais que si elle voulait que sa voix fût comptée en
Europe, c'était pour pouvoir défendre les droits des autres contre
toute espèce d'envahissement.

Je ne voyais dans tous ceux qui avaient pris part aux affaires
personne qui me parût réunir les conditions nécessaires pour remplir
convenablement cette mission. Les hommes revenus avec le roi étaient
restés étrangers aux affaires générales; ceux qui tenaient au
gouvernement déchu ne pouvaient encore comprendre les intérêts et la
situation de la monarchie qui renaissait. Je regardais la position du
plénipotentiaire français à Vienne comme très difficile; je n'en
connus jamais de plus honorable.

C'était, en effet, le rôle de ce plénipotentiaire de compléter l'oeuvre
de la Restauration, en assurant la solidité de l'édifice que la
Providence avait permis de reconstruire. Je me crus le droit, et je
regardai comme un devoir de réclamer ce poste. Le roi ne me laissa pas
achever la demande que j'allais lui en faire, et m'interrompit, en me
disant: «Présentez-moi un projet pour vos instructions.» Je le
remerciai, et je le priai de nommer avec moi le duc de Dalberg que je
voulais distinguer, pour qui j'avais de l'amitié, et qui d'ailleurs
par sa naissance, par ses relations de famille en Allemagne et par sa
capacité, serait pour moi un coopérateur utile.

Au bout de peu de jours, je pus mettre sous les yeux du roi, le projet
d'instructions qu'il m'avait demandé. Il l'approuva, et je crois que
lorsqu'on connaîtra ces instructions, que je donnerai plus loin, la
France s'honorera du souverain qui les a signées.

Pour m'accompagner, je fis choix dans le département des affaires
étrangères du fidèle et habile La Besnardière, que je regarde comme
l'homme le plus distingué qui ait paru dans le ministère des affaires
étrangères depuis un grand nombre d'années. Je mis auprès de lui MM.
Challaye, Formond[124] et Perrey, jeunes tous trois, et ayant en eux
de quoi profiter des leçons qu'on devait puiser dans d'aussi grandes
circonstances.

  [124] M. de Formond était employé au bureau du chiffre à la
  chancellerie. Il devint plus tard consul et séjourna en cette
  qualité à Bucharest (1815), à Cagliari (1817), à Livourne 1830. Il
  prit sa retraite en 1840.

Je cherchai ensuite dans la société deux personnes que je pourrais en
outre attacher à la légation française à Vienne. Dans mon choix, je
m'occupai beaucoup plus de Paris, c'est-à-dire des Tuileries, que de
Vienne, parce que, à Paris, il y avait à contenir tous les petits
faiseurs diplomatiques qui environnaient les princes, et à qui je
voulais donner l'assurance d'avoir autour de moi, sans que j'eusse
l'air de le savoir, mais aussi, sans qu'il y eût de danger pour les
affaires, une correspondance particulière; car, pour Vienne et pour la
France, je comptais sur moi-même. C'est ainsi que le comte Alexis de
Noailles[125] et le marquis de la Tour du Pin Gouvernet[126] ont été
associés au duc de Dalberg et à moi comme plénipotentiaires au congrès
de Vienne.

  [125] Alexis comte de Noailles, fils de Louis-Marie vicomte de
  Noailles, né en 1783. En 1809, il fut arrêté comme coupable d'avoir
  répandu la bulle d'excommunication du pape contre l'empereur. Mis
  peu après en liberté, il s'expatria en 1811, se rendit en Suisse,
  puis à Stockholm, enfin en Angleterre où il rejoignit Louis XVIII.
  Il fit la campagne de 1813 comme aide de camp de Bernadotte, et
  servit également dans les rangs ennemis en 1814. Il devint alors
  aide de camp du comte d'Artois, et suivit le prince de Talleyrand à
  Vienne. En 1815, il fut élu député de l'Oise et du Rhône, et nommé
  ministre d'État et membre du conseil privé. Il fut constamment
  réélu jusqu'en 1830, époque où il rentra dans la vie privée. Il
  mourut en 1835.

  [126] Frédéric marquis de La Tour du Pin Gouvernet, né en 1758,
  était le fils du comte de La Tour du Pin, qui fut député aux états
  généraux, ministre de la guerre en 1789, et qui fut guillotiné en
  1794. Il était colonel au début de la Révolution, et fut nommé
  ministre à La Haye. Destitué en 1792, il émigra, rentra en France
  sous le consulat, et devint préfet d'Amiens et de Bruxelles. Il
  suivit M. de Talleyrand à Vienne, fut ensuite nommé de nouveau
  ministre à La Haye, puis près le roi de Sardaigne. Il se retira en
  1830, et mourut en 1837.

Il me parut aussi qu'il fallait faire revenir la haute et influente
société de Vienne des préventions hostiles que la France impériale lui
avait inspirées. Il était nécessaire pour cela de lui rendre
l'ambassade française agréable; je demandai donc à ma nièce, madame la
comtesse Edmond de Périgord, de vouloir bien m'accompagner et faire
les honneurs de ma maison. Par son esprit supérieur et par son tact,
elle sut attirer et plaire, et me fut fort utile.

A Vienne, il fallait faire tenir à la France un autre langage que
celui qu'on était depuis vingt ans habitué à entendre de sa part. Il
n'était pas moins nécessaire que la dignité qu'elle montrerait fût
exprimée avec noblesse, même avec éclat. Le rôle d'abnégation, si
nouveau pour elle, et qui lui était imposé par les fautes de
l'empereur Napoléon, pouvait, dans mon opinion, n'être point dépourvu
de grandeur, et devait même donner du poids aux observations que je
serais appelé à faire dans l'intérêt de la justice et du droit. Aussi,
ce fut par l'utilité dont elle pouvait être en appuyant les faibles,
que je cherchai à la placer immédiatement dans une situation digne et
honorable.

On doit pressentir aisément que d'assez grandes difficultés
m'attendaient à Vienne, pour que cela me serve de réponse aux
reproches qui m'ont été faits d'avoir quitté Paris au moment où le
gouvernement, mal conseillé, pouvait suivre une marche imprudente,
retarder par là son affermissement et refroidir les sentiments qu'on
avait montrés au roi à son arrivée. De plus, il faut avant tout faire
ce que l'on sait faire; et ici, j'entreprenais une tâche dans laquelle
j'avais la confiance de réussir. Et je le demande à tous les gens de
bonne foi, était-il naturel de croire qu'au lieu de mettre ses soins à
ne pas réveiller des souvenirs qu'il fallait faire oublier, et à
éloigner toutes les apparences d'une volonté arbitraire, un
gouvernement nouveau ne s'appliquerait qu'à faire le contraire? La
vérité est, je l'avoue, que je ne m'étais point attendu à un pareil
aveuglement. Je n'aurais jamais cru que M. l'abbé de Montesquiou, qui
avait la première influence, l'emploierait aussi mal.

L'empereur Alexandre ne fut pas longtemps sans montrer à quel point il
était étonné de la marche que l'on suivait dans les affaires
intérieures de la France. C'était un embarras de plus. Il recevait ses
impressions des libéraux les plus ardents, qu'il voyait
habituellement. Je crus devoir après son départ pour l'Angleterre,
d'où son projet était de revenir à Paris, lui écrire la lettre
suivante. Elle a pu lui faire faire quelques réflexions, s'il l'a
retrouvée, en 1823, dans son portefeuille[127].

  [127] Nous avons vérifié que l'original de cette lettre se trouve
  encore aux archives impériales à Pétersbourg (1857). (_Note de M.
  de Bacourt._)


LE PRINCE DE BÉNÉVENT A L'EMPEREUR ALEXANDRE.

«Paris, le 13 juin 1814.

»SIRE,

»Je n'ai point vu Votre Majesté avant son départ, et j'ose lui en
faire un reproche dans la sincérité respectueuse du plus tendre
attachement.

»Sire, des relations importantes vous livrèrent, il y a longtemps, mes
secrets sentiments. Votre estime en fut la suite; elle me consola
pendant plusieurs années, et m'aida à soutenir de pénibles épreuves;
je démêlai d'avance votre destinée, et je sentis que je pourrais, tout
Français que j'étais, m'associer un jour à vos projets, parce qu'ils
ne cesseraient point d'être magnanimes. Vous l'avez remplie tout
entière, cette belle destinée; si je vous ai suivi dans votre noble
carrière, ne me privez point de ma récompense; je le demande au héros
de mon imagination, et j'ose ajouter, de mon coeur.

Vous avez sauvé la France; votre entrée à Paris a signalé la fin du
despotisme; quelles que soient vos secrètes observations, si vous y
étiez encore appelé, ce que vous avez fait, il faudrait le faire
encore; car vous ne pourriez manquer à votre gloire, quand même vous
croiriez avoir entrevu la monarchie disposée à ressaisir un peu plus
d'autorité que vous ne le croyez nécessaire, et les Français négliger
le soin de leur indépendance. Après tout, que sommes-nous encore, et
qui peut se flatter, à la suite d'une pareille tourmente, de
comprendre en peu de temps le caractère des Français? N'en doutez pas,
Sire, le roi que vous nous avez reconquis, s'il veut nous donner des
institutions utiles, sera obligé, en y mêlant quelques précautions, de
chercher dans son heureuse mémoire ce que nous étions autrefois, pour
bien juger de ce qui nous convient. Détournés par une sombre
oppression de nos habitudes nationales, nous paraîtrons longtemps
étrangers au gouvernement qu'on nous donnera.

»Les Français, en général, étaient et seront légers dans leurs
impressions; on les verra toujours prompts à les répandre, parce qu'un
secret instinct les avertit qu'elles ne doivent pas être de longue
durée. Cette mobilité les conduira à déposer bientôt une confiance
assez étendue dans les mains de leur souverain, et le nôtre n'en
abusera pas.

»En France, le roi a toujours été beaucoup plus que la patrie; il
semble, pour nous, qu'elle se soit fait homme; nous n'avons point
d'orgueil national, mais une vanité étendue, qui, bien réglée, produit
un sentiment très fort de l'honneur individuel. Nos opinions, ou
plutôt nos goûts, ont souvent dirigé nos rois (Bonaparte eût répandu
plus impunément le sang français, s'il n'eût voulu nous asservir à
ses sombres manières). Les formes, les manières de nos souverains
nous ont façonnés à notre tour, et de cette réaction mutuelle vous
verrez sortir de chez nous un mode de gouverner et d'obéir qui, après
tout, pourrait finir par mériter le nom de constitution. Le roi a
longtemps étudié notre histoire; il nous sait; il sait donner un
caractère royal à tout ce qui émane de lui; et quand nous serons
rentrés en nous-mêmes, nous reviendrons à cette habitude vraiment
française de nous approprier les actions et les qualités de notre roi.
D'ailleurs, les principes libéraux marchent avec l'esprit du siècle,
il faut qu'on y arrive; et si Votre Majesté veut se fier à ma parole,
je lui promets que nous aurons de la monarchie liée à la liberté;
qu'elle verra les hommes de mérite accueillis et placés en France, et
je garantis à votre gloire, le bonheur de notre pays.

»Sire, je conviens que vous avez vu à Paris beaucoup de mécontents;
mais en écartant encore la promptitude de la dernière révolution, et
la surprise de tant de passions toutes agitées en même temps,
qu'est-ce que Paris, après tout? Rien qu'une ville d'appointement. La
cessation seule des appointements a averti les Parisiens du despotisme
de Bonaparte. Si on avait continué de payer les gens en place, c'est
en vain que les provinces auraient gémi de la tyrannie. Les provinces,
voilà la vraie France; c'est là qu'on bénit réellement le retour de la
maison de Bourbon, et que l'on proclame votre heureuse victoire.

»Votre Majesté me pardonnera les longueurs de cette lettre; elles
étaient indispensables pour répondre à la plus grande partie de ses
généreuses inquiétudes; elles me tiendront lieu d'une explication que
j'aurais tant aimé à lui donner. Le général Pozzo[128], que je vois
tous les jours, et que je ne puis trop vous remercier, Sire, de nous
avoir laissé, nous regardera, nous avertira, car nous avons besoin
quelquefois d'être avertis; je traiterai avec lui les intérêts de
nation; et si, comme je l'espère, Votre Majesté honore la France de
quelques moments de retour, il vous dira, et vous verrez vous-même,
que je ne vous aurai pas trompé.

  [128] Charles André, comte Pozzo di Borgo, né près d'Ajaccio en
  1764. D'abord très lié avec Napoléon dans sa jeunesse, ils se
  brouillèrent au cours des discordes civiles de la Corse, et ce fut
  le début d'une inimitié qui se prolongea autant que leur vie. En
  1791, Pozzo fut élu député de la Corse à l'Assemblée législative.
  Revenu en Corse en 1792, il fut l'année suivante appelé aux
  affaires, avec Paoli, par ses concitoyens. La Corse s'étant un
  instant donnée à l'Angleterre, Pozzo fut alors président du conseil
  d'État et secrétaire d'État. Il dut émigrer en 1796, alla à
  Londres, puis à Vienne, et en 1803, entra au service de la Russie
  comme diplomate. Il revint en Autriche après Tilsitt, puis passa de
  là en Angleterre (1809), et négocia un rapprochement entre Londres
  et Pétersbourg. Il eut une influence considérable sur les
  événements de 1812 et 1813. En 1814, il accompagna l'empereur
  Alexandre à Paris, fut nommé ambassadeur de Russie en France,
  chargé de nombreuses missions diplomatiques, et assista à tous les
  congrès de la sainte alliance. En 1835 il devint ambassadeur à
  Londres, se démit en 1839 et mourut en 1843.

»Une autre confidente, une seule, a reçu le secret de mon chagrin; je
veux parler de la duchesse de Courlande que vous honorez de vos bontés
et qui entend si bien mes inquiétudes. Quand nous aurons le bonheur de
vous revoir, je lui laisserai le soin de vous dire combien j'ai été
peiné, et elle vous dira aussi que je ne méritais pas de l'être.

»Mais, Sire, que votre âme généreuse sache avoir un peu de patience!
Vrai bon Français que je suis, permettez-moi de vous demander en vieux
langage français, de nous laisser reprendre l'ancienne _accoutumance_
de l'amour de nos rois; ce n'est pas à vous à refuser de comprendre
l'influence de ce sentiment sur une grande nation.

»Veuillez agréer, Sire avec votre bonté accoutumée, l'hommage du
profond respect avec lequel je suis Sire, de Votre Majesté, le très
humble et très obéissant serviteur.

»Le prince DE BÉNÉVENT.»

       *       *       *       *       *

Voici maintenant les instructions qui m'avaient été données par Louis
XVIII, au moment de mon départ pour Vienne:


INSTRUCTIONS

POUR LES AMBASSADEURS DU ROI AU CONGRÈS.

«Aucune assemblée investie de pouvoirs ne peut rien faire de légitime,
qu'autant qu'elle est légitimement formée et conséquemment qu'aucun de
ceux qui ont le droit d'y être n'en est exclu, et qu'aucun de ceux qui
n'ont pas ce droit n'y est admis; qu'elle se renferme scrupuleusement
dans les bornes de sa compétence et qu'elle procède, selon les règles
prescrites, ou à défaut de ces règles, selon celles qui se peuvent
tirer de la fin pour laquelle elle a été formée et de la nature des
choses. C'est la nature des choses qui, par les rapports de dépendance
qu'elle met entre les objets divers, fixe l'ordre dans lequel il est
indispensable de les régler, une question subordonnée ne pouvant pas
être traitée et résolue avant celle dont elle dépend. Enfin, les actes
les plus légitimes et les plus sages seraient vains et en pure perte,
si, faute de moyen d'exécution, ils restaient sans effet.

Il est donc de toute nécessité que le congrès détermine avant tout:

»1º Quels sont les États qui doivent y avoir leurs plénipotentiaires;

»2º Quels objets devront ou pourront y être réglés;

»3º Par quelle voie ils devront l'être; s'ils le seront par voie de
décision ou d'arbitrage, ou bien par voie de négociations, ou en
partie par l'une, et en partie par l'autre de ces deux voies, et les
cas pour lesquels on devra se servir de chacune d'elles;

»4º Pour les cas où la voie de décision sera employée, de quelle
manière seront formés les votes;

»5º L'ordre dans lequel les objets seront traités;

»6º La forme à donner aux décisions;

»7º Le mode et les moyens d'exécution, pour le cas où il se
rencontrerait des obstacles quelconques.

»D'après l'article XXXII du traité du 30 mai, le congrès doit être
général, et toutes les puissances engagées de part et d'autre dans la
guerre que ce traité a terminée doivent y envoyer leurs
plénipotentiaires. Bien que la dénomination de _puissances_ emporte
avec elle une idée indéterminée de grandeur et de force, qui semble la
rendre inapplicable à beaucoup d'États dépourvus de l'une et de
l'autre, employée comme elle l'est dans l'article XXXII, d'une manière
abstraite avec une généralité qui n'est restreinte que par
l'expression d'un rapport entièrement indépendant de la force
comparative des États et commun entre les plus petits et les plus
grands, elle comprend incontestablement l'universalité de ceux entre
lesquels ce rapport existe, c'est-à-dire qui ont été d'une part ou de
l'autre engagés dans la guerre que le traité du 30 mai a terminée. Or,
si l'on excepte la Turquie et la Suisse, car la république de
Saint-Marin ne saurait être comptée, tous les États de l'Europe,
grands et petits, ont été engagés dans cette guerre. Le droit des
plus petits d'envoyer un plénipotentiaire au congrès résulte donc de
la disposition du traité du 30 mai. La France n'a pas songé à les
exclure et les autres puissances contractantes ne l'ont pas pu,
puisque stipulant pour eux et en leur nom, elles n'ont pas pu stipuler
contre eux. Les plus petits États, ceux que l'on pourrait le plus
vouloir exclure, à raison de leur faiblesse, sont tous ou presque tous
en Allemagne. L'Allemagne doit former une confédération dont ils sont
membres, et dont, par conséquent, l'organisation les intéresse au plus
haut point. On ne la peut faire sans eux, qu'en violant leur
indépendance naturelle, et l'article VI du traité du 30 mai, qui la
consacre implicitement, en disant que les États de l'Allemagne seront
indépendants et unis par un lien fédératif. Cette organisation sera
faite au congrès; il serait donc injuste de les en exclure.

»A ces motifs de justice, se joint une raison d'utilité pour la
France. Ce qui est de l'intérêt des petits États est aussi de son
intérêt. Tous voudront conserver leur existence, et elle doit vouloir
qu'ils la conservent. Quelques-uns peuvent désirer de s'agrandir, et
il lui convient qu'ils s'agrandissent, en tant que cela peut diminuer
l'accroissement des grands États. Sa politique doit être de les
protéger et de les favoriser, mais sans qu'on en puisse prendre
ombrage, ce qui lui serait moins facile s'ils n'assistaient point au
congrès, et qu'au lieu de n'avoir qu'à appuyer leurs demandes, elle en
dût faire pour eux. D'un autre côté, le besoin qu'ils auront de son
appui lui donnera sur eux de l'influence. Il n'est donc point
indifférent pour elle que leurs voix soient ou non comptées.

»En conséquence, les ambassadeurs du roi s'opposeront, s'il y a lieu,
à ce que, sous le prétexte de la petitesse d'un État engagé dans la
dernière guerre, les plénipotentiaires que le souverain de cet État
enverrait au congrès en soient exclus, et ils insisteront pour qu'ils
y soient admis.

»Les nations d'Europe ne vivent point entre elles sous la seule loi
morale ou de nature, mais encore sous une loi qu'elles se sont faite
et qui donne à la première une sanction qui lui manque; loi établie
par des conventions écrites, ou par des usages constamment,
universellement et réciproquement suivis, toujours fondée sur un
consentement mutuel, exprès ou tacite, et qui est obligatoire pour
toutes. Cette loi, c'est le droit public.

»Or il y a dans ce droit deux principes fondamentaux: l'un, que la
souveraineté ne peut être acquise par le simple l'ait de la conquête,
ni passer au conquérant, si le souverain ne la lui cède; l'autre,
qu'aucun titre de souveraineté, et conséquemment le droit qu'il
suppose, n'ont de réalité pour les autres États, qu'autant qu'ils
l'ont reconnu.

»Toutes les fois qu'un pays conquis a un souverain, la cession est
possible, et il suit du premier des principes cités qu'elle ne peut
être remplacée ni suppléée par rien.

»Mais un pays conquis peut n'avoir pas de souverain, soit parce que
celui qui l'était, a, pour lui et ses héritiers, renoncé simplement à
son droit, sans le céder; soit parce que la famille régnante vient à
s'éteindre, sans que personne soit appelé légalement à régner après
elle. Dans une république, à l'instant où elle est conquise, le
souverain cesse d'exister, parce que sa nature est telle que la
liberté est une condition nécessaire de son existence, et qu'il y a
une impossibilité absolue à ce que, tant que dure la conquête, il soit
libre un seul moment.

»La cession par le souverain est alors impossible.

»S'ensuit-il que, dans ce cas, le droit de conquête puisse se
prolonger indéfiniment, ou se convertir de lui-même en droit de
souveraineté? Nullement.

»La souveraineté est, dans la société générale de l'Europe, ce qu'est
la propriété privée dans une société civile particulière. Un pays ou
un État sous la conquête et sans souverain, et une propriété sans
maître, sont des biens vacants, mais faisant respectivement, et l'un
aussi bien que l'autre, partie d'un territoire qui n'est pas vacant,
conséquemment soumis à la loi de ce territoire, et ne pouvant être
acquis que conformément à cette loi, savoir: la propriété privée,
conformément au droit public de l'État particulier où elle est située,
et le pays ou l'État, conformément au droit public européen qui est la
loi générale du territoire formant le domaine commun de l'Europe. Or,
c'est un des principes de ce droit que la souveraineté ne peut être
transférée par le seul fait de la conquête. Donc, lorsque la cession
par le souverain est impossible, il est de toute nécessité qu'elle
soit suppléée. Donc, elle ne peut l'être que par la sanction de
l'Europe.

»Un souverain dont les États sont sous la conquête (s'il est une
personne naturelle), ne cessant point d'être souverain, à moins qu'il
n'ait cédé son droit, ou qu'il n'y ait renoncé, ne perd par la
conquête que la possession de fait, et conserve conséquemment le droit
de faire tout ce que ne suppose pas cette possession. L'envoi de
plénipotentiaires au congrès la suppose si peu, qu'il peut avoir pour
objet de la réclamer.

»Ainsi, le roi de Saxe et le prince primat, comme légitime souverain
d'Aschaffenbourg[129] (si toutefois il n'a pas abdiqué), peuvent y
envoyer les leurs; et non seulement ils le peuvent, mais il est
nécessaire qu'ils le fassent, car, dans le cas plus que probable où
l'on voudra disposer en tout ou en partie de leurs possessions, comme
on ne pourrait légitimement en disposer sans une cession ou
renonciation de leur part, il faut que quelqu'un, muni de leurs
pouvoirs, puisse céder ou renoncer en leur nom; et comme c'est un
troisième principe du droit public de l'Europe, qu'une cession ou
renonciation est nulle si elle n'a pas été faite librement,
c'est-à-dire par un souverain en liberté, les ambassadeurs du roi
feront en sorte que quelque envoyé demande, en invoquant ce principe,
que le roi de Saxe puisse se retirer immédiatement en tel lieu qu'il
jugera convenable, et ils appuieront cette demande. Au besoin, ils la
feraient eux-mêmes.

  [129] Le prince primat avait été nommé prince souverain
  d'Aschaffenbourg, Francfort et Wetzlar par l'empereur, au moment de
  la formation de la confédération du Rhin.

»Le duc d'Oldenbourg[130], et le duc d'Arenberg[131], les princes de
Salm[132], possédaient en souveraineté des pays qui ont été saisis en
pleine paix par celui qui se nommait et devait être leur protecteur,
et qui ont été réunis à la France, mais qu'ils n'ont point cédés. Les
alliés ne paraissent point avoir jusqu'ici reconnu les droits des
maisons d'Arenberg et de Salm; mais ces droits subsistent aussi bien
que ceux du prince d'Isenbourg, qui, absent de chez lui et au service
de la France, a été traité comme ennemi, et dont les États sont sous
la conquête.

  [130] Le grand-duché d'Oldenbourg avait été annexé par Napoléon le
  13 décembre 1810.

  [131] Les États des ducs d'Arenberg avaient été en partie réunis à
  la France par le traité de Lunéville. Ceux-ci avaient reçu en
  échange le comté de Meppen et le fort de Rechlinghausen. En 1803,
  le duc régnant, Louis-Angilbert, abdiqua en faveur de son fils
  Prosper-Louis, né en 1785. Celui-ci devint en 1806 sénateur de
  l'empire français, entra dans la confédération du Rhin en 1807,
  leva en 1808 un régiment de chasseurs avec lequel il fut envoyé en
  Espagne. Il fut fait prisonnier et conduit en Angleterre. En 1810,
  Napoléon disposa de ses États qui furent en partie annexés à la
  France, en partie réunis au grand-duché de Berg. En 1815, les États
  du duc d'Arenberg furent attribués au Hanovre et à la Prusse, et
  lui-même devint membre de la chambre haute du Hanovre.

  [132] Constantin-Alexandre, prince de Salm-Salm et Frédéric IV
  prince de Salm-Kyrbourg. La principauté de Salm fut réunie à la
  France en 1802. En échange, le prince de Salm-Kyrbourg, qui servait
  dans l'armée française comme officier supérieur de cavalerie,
  obtint l'évêché de Munster et entra dans la confédération du Rhin.
  En 1812, Napoléon annexa ce territoire moyennant une rente de 400
  000 francs qui fut payée au prince. En 1814, son ancienne
  principauté fut réunie à la Prusse.

»Les princes et comtes de l'ancien empire germanique, devenus sujets
des membres de la confédération du Rhin, en vertu de l'acte qui la
forma, ne peuvent point être considérés comme des souverains
dépossédés, attendu qu'ils n'étaient point souverains, mais simplement
vassaux et sujets de l'empereur et de l'empire dont la souveraineté
sur eux a été transférée à leurs nouveaux maîtres. Les tentatives
qu'ils feraient pour se faire reconnaître comme souverains dépossédés,
et que quelques puissances pourraient vouloir appuyer, doivent être
repoussées comme illégitimes et comme dangereuses. La seule hésitation
sur ce point suffirait pour agiter, et peut-être, pour mettre en feu
tout le midi de l'Allemagne.

»L'ordre de Saint-Jean de Jérusalem pourrait vouloir envoyer au
congrès; mais attendu que l'île de Malte et ses dépendances étaient le
seul territoire qu'il possédât; qu'il les a cédées, et qu'il ne peut y
avoir de souverain sans territoire, pas plus que de propriétaire sans
propriété, il a cessé d'être souverain, et ne peut le redevenir qu'en
acquérant un territoire.

»La délivrance d'un pays conquis, de quelque manière qu'elle s'opère,
rend immédiatement la possession au souverain qui n'a perdu qu'elle,
et à la république, son existence. Ils ne reprennent l'un et l'autre
que ce qui était à eux, et n'a appartenu à aucun autre.

»Les électeurs de Hanovre et de Hesse, le prince de Nassau-Orange
comme prince d'Allemagne, les ducs de Brunswick[133] et d'Oldenbourg,
qui tous, par la dissolution de l'empire germanique, se trouvaient
indépendants lorsque leurs pays furent envahis, ou qu'on en disposa,
possèdent aujourd'hui au même titre qu'auparavant.

  [133] Frédéric-Guillaume, duc de Brunswick-OEls, né en 1771, avait
  succédé à son père en 1806. Mais la paix de Tilsitt le déposséda et
  annexa son duché au royaume de Westphalie. Après de vains efforts
  pour reconquérir son patrimoine, il se réfugia en Angleterre,
  reprit les armes en 1813, fut réintégré dans ses États le 22
  décembre de la même année, mais fut tué à Waterloo.

»Les villes de Lübeck, Bremen et Hambourg étaient devenues
indépendantes par la dissolution de l'empire germanique; celle de
Dantzig, par la paix de Tilsitt[134]. Les républiques du Valais, de
Gênes, de Lucques, de Raguse, l'étaient depuis des siècles. Toutes
sont tombées sous la conquête, à moins qu'on ne regarde comme valables
les actes par lesquels Gênes et Lucques parurent se donner
elles-mêmes.

  [134] Napoléon avait alors enlevé Dantzig à la Prusse, et l'avait
  déclarée ville libre. Mais elle devait être occupée par une
  garnison française.

»Celles qu'aucune force étrangère n'occupe, qu'aucune autorité
étrangère ne gouverne maintenant, sont redevenues ce qu'elles
étaient, et peuvent avoir des ministres au congrès. Les autres ne le
peuvent pas.

»Genève a été rendue à son ancienne liberté; mais elle n'a point été
engagée, comme État, dans la guerre que le traité du 30 mai a
terminée; et elle doit faire partie de la confédération helvétique,
qui n'y a pas non plus été engagée.

»L'île d'Elbe ne forme un État que depuis que la guerre a cessé[135].

  [135] Napoléon avait été reconnu prince souverain de l'île d'Elbe.

»La conquête, ne pouvant par elle-même donner la souveraineté, ne peut
non plus la rendre. Le souverain qui rentre par la conquête dans un
pays qu'il a cédé n'en redevient point souverain, pas plus qu'un
propriétaire en s'emparant d'une chose qu'il a aliénée n'en redevient
propriétaire.

»Ce que la conquête ne peut donner à un seul, elle ne le peut donner à
plusieurs. Si donc plusieurs co-conquérants s'attribuent ou se donnent
réciproquement la souveraineté sur ce qu'ils ont conquis, ils font un
acte que le droit public désavoue et annule.

»Le prince d'Orange[136] avait cédé tous ses droits sur la Hollande,
mais le traité du 30 mai, signé par huit des principales puissances de
l'Europe, et contracté au nom de toutes, lui rend ce pays. (_Traité
patent_, art. VI.)

  [136] Guillaume prince d'Orange-Nassau, plus tard roi des Pays-Bas,
  né en 1772, était le fils du stathouder Guillaume V. Il commandait
  les troupes hollandaises en 1794 et 1795. Devant l'invasion
  française son père abdiqua et se réfugia en Angleterre, et le
  prince Guillaume passa au service de l'Autriche. En 1803, il obtint
  l'abbaye de Fulde qui venait d'être sécularisée moyennant l'abandon
  de tous ses droits sur la Hollande. Mais, ayant pris en 1806 le
  parti de la Prusse, il fut dépouillé de cette principauté ainsi que
  de ses possessions patrimoniales. Il reprit alors du service en
  Autriche. Il rentra en Hollande en 1813, et prit le titre de prince
  souverain des Provinces-Unies. Le congrès de Vienne lui reconnut le
  titre de roi des Pays-Bas, et réunit la Belgique à la Hollande.
  L'année suivante le roi Guillaume Ier entra de nouveau dans la
  coalition et fut blessé à Waterloo. Il régna jusqu'en 1830. A cette
  date, il perdit la Belgique qui proclama son indépendance. Le roi
  abdiqua en 1840 et mourut à Berlin en 1843.

»Le même traité, en posant quelques bases des dispositions à faire par
le congrès, dit que les anciens États du roi de Sardaigne, dont il
n'avait cédé qu'une partie, lui seront rendus (art. II, _secret_) et
que l'Autriche aura pour limites, au delà des Alpes, le Pô, le lac
Majeur et le Tésin, ce qui lui rendra les pays qui lui avaient
appartenu et qu'elle avait cédés sur le golfe Adriatique et en Italie.
(Art. VI, _patent_, et II _secret_.)

»Le prince d'Orange a donc un droit légitime actuel, et le roi de
Sardaigne et l'Autriche, un droit presque actuel de souveraineté sur
des pays qui avaient cessé de leur appartenir, parce qu'ils les
avaient cédés.

»Mais le traité n'a rendu à la Prusse aucun des pays qu'elle a cédés
en divers temps en deçà de l'Elbe. Elle n'a donc aucun droit réel de
souveraineté sur ces pays, si l'on excepte la principauté de
Neufchâtel, pour laquelle le dernier et légitime possesseur a fait
avec elle un arrangement qui peut être considéré comme une cession. Le
traité n'a point rendu la Toscane et Modène aux archiducs
Ferdinand[137] et François[138] qui n'en sont conséquemment point et
n'en peuvent pas être légitimes souverains.

  [137] Ferdinand, archiduc d'Autriche, fils de l'empereur Léopold et
  de Marie-Louise infante d'Espagne. Il devint grand-duc de Toscane
  en 1791. Il conserva ses États jusqu'en 1799, fut alors dépossédé,
  revint un instant au pouvoir la même année. Mais la victoire de
  Marengo lui enleva de nouveau ses États qui furent transformés en
  1801 en royaume d'Étrurie, et attribués au duc Louis de Parme.
  Ferdinand se retira à Vienne, reçut en 1803 l'archevêché de
  Salzbourg avec le titre d'électeur, puis en 1805 l'évêché de
  Wurtzbourg, et en 1806 entra dans la confédération du Rhin avec le
  titre de grand-duc. Ferdinand rentra en Toscane en 1814, et régna
  jusqu'en 1824.

  [138] François IV, fils de l'archiduc Ferdinand et de Marie-Béatrix
  d'Este, petit-fils par sa mère d'Hercule III, duc de Modène. En
  1797, Hercule fut dépossédé par les Français, et ses États furent
  incorporés à la république cisalpine, où ils formèrent les
  départements du Crostolo chef-lieu Reggio, et du Panaro chef-lieu
  Modène. François fut nommé duc de Modène en 1814. Il régna jusqu'en
  1846. De son mariage avec Marie-Béatrix, fille du roi de Sardaigne
  Victor-Emmanuel Ier, il eut plusieurs enfants, parmi lesquels la
  princesse Marie-Thérèse, qui épousa le comte de Chambord.

»Un prince qui s'attribue la souveraineté sur un pays conquis, qui ne
lui a point été cédé, l'usurpe. Si ce pays lui a précédemment
appartenu, et s'il est vacant, l'usurpation est moins odieuse; mais
c'est une usurpation qui ne peut donner aucun droit légitime.

»Le pays de Modène ayant été cédé et étant devenu partie intégrante
d'un autre État, avant la guerre que le traité du 30 mai a terminée,
n'a point été comme État engagé dans cette guerre. Ainsi, eût-il
maintenant un souverain légitime, ce souverain ne pourrait avoir de
ministre au congrès.

»Le pays de Parme, également cédé, avait également cessé, avant la
guerre, de former un État séparé, et n'en est redevenu un qu'après la
guerre terminée[139].

  [139] Le duché de Parme avait été réuni à la république cisalpine
  en 1802. Sous l'empire, il fut annexé à la France et forma le
  département du Taro chef-lieu Parme.

»La Toscane n'est point un pays vacant, quoique la France, à qui elle
avait été cédée et réunie, y ait renoncé parce qu'elle avait été cédée
sous une condition qui n'a point été remplie, sous la condition de
fournir un équivalent déterminé qui n'a point été fourni, ce qui a
fait rentrer la reine d'Étrurie dans son droit de souveraineté sur ce
pays[140].

  [140] On se rappelle que le traité secret de Fontainebleau du 27
  octobre 1807 promettait à la reine-régente d'Étrurie, en échange de
  ses États d'Italie, le royaume de Lusitanie, que l'on formerait
  d'une partie du Portugal. Cet engagement n'avait pas été tenu.

»Le droit le plus légitime peut être contesté. Il devient alors et
reste douteux tant que la contestation n'est pas terminée; et l'effet
en est suspendu pour tous les cas, et partout où il est nécessaire
qu'il soit certain. Un souverain qui n'est tel que pour les États qui
le reconnaissent, ne peut, là où les envoyés de tous se réunissent, en
avoir lui-même à un titre qu'une partie d'entre eux ne lui reconnaît
pas.

»Ferdinand IV ne peut donc avoir d'envoyés au congrès que comme roi de
Sicile. C'est assez dire que celui qui règne à Naples n'y en peut pas
avoir.

»De tout ce qui précède on peut tirer cette règle générale:

»Que tout prince ayant sur des États engagés dans la dernière guerre
un droit de souveraineté qui a été universellement reconnu, qu'il n'a
point cédé, et qui n'est reconnu à aucun autre (que ces États soient
ou non sous la conquête), peut, de même que tout État que la guerre a
trouvé libre, qui y a été engagé, et qui est actuellement libre, avoir
un plénipotentiaire au congrès; que tous autres princes ou États n'y
en peuvent avoir.

»Les ambassadeurs du roi s'attacheront à cette règle et s'appliqueront
à la faire adopter et suivre.

»Le traité du 30 mai ne cite comme étant à régler au congrès que les
objets suivants:

»1º La disposition à faire des territoires auxquels la France a
renoncé (art. I, _secret_);

»2º Les rapports desquels doit résulter un système d'équilibre réel et
durable en Europe (même article);

»3º L'organisation de la confédération des États de l'Allemagne (art.
VI, _patent_);

»4º La garantie de l'organisation que la Suisse s'est ou se sera
donnée depuis le traité (art. II, _secret_);

»5º Les droits à lever sur la navigation du Rhin par les États
riverains (art. V, _patent_);

»6º L'application (si elle est jugée praticable) aux fleuves qui
séparent ou traversent différents États, de la disposition qui rend
libre la navigation du Rhin (même article);

»7º L'abolition universelle de la traite des noirs.(Traité avec
l'Angleterre, 1er article additionnel.)

»Mais les territoires auxquels la France a renoncé ne sont pas les
seuls dont la disposition soit à faire; il y a encore à disposer de
ceux qui appartenaient à Napoléon, à un autre titre que celui de chef
de la France, ou à des individus de sa famille, et auxquels il a
renoncé et pour lui et pour eux.

»Outre ces territoires, il y en a beaucoup d'autres qui sont sous la
conquête. Si le congrès n'en devait pas régler le sort, comment
pourrait-il établir cet équilibre qui doit être la fin principale et
dernière de ses opérations? Des rapports déterminés entre les forces,
et conséquemment entre les possessions de tous les États n'en sont-ils
pas une condition nécessaire? Et des rapports certains entre les
possessions de tous peuvent-ils exister, si le droit de posséder est
incertain pour plusieurs? Ce n'est point un équilibre momentané qui
doit être établi, mais un équilibre durable. Il ne peut durer
qu'autant que dureront les rapports sur lesquels on l'aura fondé, et
ces rapports ne pourront durer eux-mêmes qu'autant que le droit de
posséder sera transmis dans un ordre qui ne les change pas. L'ordre de
succession, dans chaque État, doit donc entrer comme élément
nécessaire dans le calcul de l'équilibre, non pas de manière à être
changé, s'il est certain, mais de manière à être rendu certain, s'il
ne l'est pas. Il y a une raison de plus de le fixer, si l'État où il
est douteux est un État que l'on agrandit; car, en donnant à son
possesseur actuel, on donne à son héritier, et il est nécessaire de
savoir à qui l'on donne. L'effet ordinaire et presque inévitable d'un
droit de succession incertain est de produire des guerres civiles ou
étrangères, et souvent les unes et les autres à la fois, ce qui non
seulement est un juste motif, mais encore fait une nécessité d'ôter
sur ce point toute incertitude.

»Le roi de Sardaigne prenait parmi ses titres celui de prince et de
vicaire perpétuel du saint empire romain. La Savoie, le
Montferrat[141], quelques districts du Piémont en étaient des fiefs.
Le droit d'y succéder était donc réglé par la loi de l'empire, et
cette loi excluait à perpétuité les femmes.

  [141] Le Montferrat était un ancien marquisat situé entre le
  Piémont et la république de Gênes. La capitale était Casal. Cet
  État fut concédé au royaume de Sardaigne par l'empereur en 1708, et
  les rois de Sardaigne prirent le titre de vicaire de l'empereur,
  titre qui avait été conféré aux maquis de Montferrat par l'empereur
  Charles IV.

»Le roi de Sardaigne possédait ses autres États comme prince
indépendant. Le droit d'y succéder ne pouvait donc pas y être réglé
par la loi de l'empire, sous laquelle ils n'étaient pas. L'ordre de
succession y a-t-il été établi par une loi expresse qui soit
applicable à une circonstance pour laquelle la loi tacite de l'usage
ne la saurait suppléer, parce que cette circonstance ne s'est encore
jamais présentée? celle où la maison de Savoie étant divisée en deux
lignes, il ne resterait de la ligne régnante que des femmes,
circonstance qui, à la vérité, appartient encore à l'avenir, mais à un
avenir tellement sûr et tellement prochain que, relativement à
l'Europe, et relativement aux objets que le congrès doit régler, elle
doit être considérée comme actuelle. La ligne régnante ne compte que
trois princes, tous trois d'un âge avancé: l'ancien roi qui est
veuf[142], le roi actuel[143] qui n'a que des filles, et le duc de
Genevois[144] qui est marié depuis sept années et qui n'a point
d'enfants.

  [142] Charles-Emmanuel II, qui avait abdiqué en 1802. Il mourut à
  Rome en 1819, sous l'habit de jésuite. Il était veuf de
  Marie-Adélaïde-Xavière-Clotilde, fille du dauphin Louis, et par
  conséquent soeur de Louis XVIII.

  [143] Victor-Emmanuel Ier, frère du précédent.

  [144] Charles-Félix, né en 1765, frère des précédents, monta sur le
  trône en 1821. Il mourut sans enfants en 1824. Le prince de
  Carignan (Charles-Albert), issu de la ligne collatérale, lui
  succéda.

»En 1445, le Piémont étant déjà depuis quatre siècles, dans la maison
de Savoie, le duc Louis, d'après ce motif que la ruine des maisons
souveraines était la suite ordinaire du partage de leurs possessions,
déclara inaliénable le domaine de Savoie, c'est-à-dire tout ce que sa
maison possédait alors et posséderait par la suite. Toutes les
acquisitions faites ou à faire furent ainsi annexées à la couronne
ducale de Savoie. Aussi voit-on que dans un cours de plusieurs
siècles, l'héritier de la Savoie l'a toujours été de toutes les
possessions de sa maison, ce qui certainement n'aurait point eu lieu,
s'il y eût eu pour les unes un autre ordre de succession que pour
l'autre. Dire que celui qui leur était commun ne devait subsister que
dans la ligne régnante, et que les femmes de celle-ci, venant à rester
seules, doivent être préférées aux mâles de l'autre ligne, pour tout
ce qui n'était pas fief de l'empire, ce serait avancer une proposition
impossible à admettre sans preuves, et impossible à prouver autrement
que par un acte légal, authentique et solennel, qui aurait établi une
telle distinction entre les deux lignes. Un acte de cette nature, s'il
existait, ne serait point resté ignoré; on le trouverait cité ou
transcrit dans plus d'un recueil, et l'on n'en trouve de trace nulle
part. On peut donc tenir pour certain qu'il n'existe pas, et qu'ainsi
la totalité de l'héritage de la maison de Sardaigne, et non pas
seulement la partie de cet héritage qui relevait de l'empire, doit, en
vertu de la loi d'hérédité en vigueur, passer immédiatement du dernier
prince de la branche régnante à ceux de la seconde branche; en autres
termes, que toutes les possessions de la maison de Sardaigne sont
héréditaires de mâle en mâle par droit de primogéniture, et à
l'exclusion des femmes. Il est même vraisemblable qu'il ne s'élèverait
à cet égard aucun doute si l'Autriche, qui aspire à posséder par
elle-même ou par des princes de sa maison tout le nord de l'Italie,
n'avait point intérêt à en élever, et si le mariage de l'archiduc
François avec la princesse fille aînée du roi ne lui offrait point un
prétexte qu'il est à craindre qu'elle ne saisisse. Il lui suffirait de
donner aux prétentions que de lui-même, ou excité par elle, l'archiduc
formerait du chef de sa femme, la qualification de droits, pour
s'attribuer à elle-même celui de les soutenir par la force des armes.
C'est à ces prétentions et aux funestes suites qu'elles ne
manqueraient pas d'entraîner, qu'il est non seulement sage mais encore
nécessaire d'obvier, en constatant le droit de la maison de Carignan
par une reconnaissance qui prévienne tout litige[145].

  [145] La maison de Carignan descend de Charles-Emmanuel Ier, duc de
  Savoie, mort en 1630. Elle était alors représentée par
  Charles-Amédée-Albert, prince de Carignan, né en 1798, cousin du
  roi Victor-Emmanuel. Il fut appelé au trône en 1831, à la mort du
  roi Charles-Félix.

»Le même principe de droit public, qui rend tout titre de souveraineté
nul pour les États qui ne l'ont point reconnu, s'étend, par une
conséquence nécessaire, à tous les moyens d'acquérir la souveraineté,
et, conséquemment, aux lois d'hérédité qui la transmettent. On sait ce
qui arriva lorsque le dernier prince de chacune des deux branches de
la première maison d'Autriche (Charles II par son testament et Charles
VI par sa pragmatique) substitua un nouvel ordre de succession à celui
qui devait finir dans sa personne. Reconnue par les uns, non reconnue
par les autres, la nouvelle loi d'hérédité devint l'objet d'une
contestation sanglante, qui ne fut et ne pouvait être terminée que
quand tous les États furent d'accord sur le droit que la disposition
faite par l'un et l'autre prince tendait à établir. Terminer une
contestation n'étant autre chose que de constater le droit, ceux sans
la reconnaissance desquels un droit serait censé ne pas exister,
peuvent, et sont les seuls qui puissent le constater: et par le même
moyen (et parce qu'il n'en est pas de l'Europe comme d'un État
particulier où les contestations sur le droit de propriété ne peuvent
avoir de suites très graves, et qui ne soient facilement et
promptement arrêtées, et où ceux qui les peuvent terminer sont
toujours présents), au pouvoir de terminer des contestations actuelles
sur le droit de souveraineté, se joint pour le congrès, non seulement
le droit, mais encore le devoir de les prévenir, autant que la nature
des choses le permet, en écartant celle de toutes les causes qui peut
le plus infailliblement les produire, savoir: l'incertitude sur le
droit de succéder.

»La Suisse avait joui pendant plusieurs siècles, au milieu des guerres
de l'Europe, et quoique interposée entre deux grandes puissances
rivales, d'une neutralité constamment respectée, et non moins
profitable aux autres qu'à elle-même. Non seulement, par cette
neutralité, le théâtre de la guerre était restreint, mais encore bien
des causes de guerre étaient prévenues, et la France se trouvait
dispensée de vouer une partie de ses moyens et de ses forces à la
défense de la portion de ses frontières la plus vulnérable, et que la
Suisse, toujours neutre, couvrait. Si, à l'avenir, la Suisse ne devait
plus être libre de rester neutre, ou, ce qui est la même chose, si sa
neutralité ne devait pas être respectée, un tel état de choses, par
l'influence qu'il aurait nécessairement sur la puissance relative des
États voisins, dérangerait et pourrait aller jusqu'à renverser cet
équilibre que l'on a en vue d'établir. Le traité du 30 mai ne parle
que de garantir l'organisation de la Suisse; mais il est nécessaire
que la neutralité future soit aussi garantie.

»La Porte ottomane n'a point été engagée dans la dernière guerre, mais
elle est une puissance européenne dont la conservation importe au
maintien de l'équilibre européen. Il est donc utile que son existence
soit aussi garantie.

»Ainsi le congrès devra régler:

»1º Le sort des États sous la conquête et non vacants, desquels il y a
deux classes, comprenant: la première, les États en litige,
c'est-à-dire les États sur lesquels un même droit de souveraineté est
reconnu à plusieurs par des puissances différentes.

»Dans cette classe sont le royaume de Naples et la Toscane.

»La seconde, les États ou pays dont le souverain a perdu la
possession, sans les avoir cédés, et sans qu'un autre s'en attribue la
souveraineté.

»Le royaume de Saxe, le duché de Varsovie, les provinces du
Saint-Siège sur l'Adriatique, les principautés d'Arenberg, d'Isemberg
et de Salm, auxquelles il faut ajouter celle d'Aschaffenbourg (si le
prince primat n'a point abdiqué) composent la seconde classe.

»2º Les droits de succession incertains.

»3º La disposition à faire des États ou pays vacants, c'est-à-dire des
États auxquels le légitime souverain a renoncé, sans les céder, ou sur
lesquels aucun droit actuel de souveraineté n'a été conféré à personne
du consentement de l'Europe.

»Ils forment aussi deux classes: la première desquelles comprend ceux
qui ont été, non pas actuellement assignés, mais destinés par le
traité du 30 mai, savoir:

»Au roi de Sardaigne, la partie de ses anciens États cédée à la
France, c'est-à-dire la Savoie et le comté de Nice (ses autres
possessions n'ayant point été cédées, il en était resté souverain de
droit) et une partie indéterminée de l'État de Gênes;

»A l'Autriche, les provinces illyriennes et la partie du royaume
d'Italie à la gauche du Pô et à l'est du lac Majeur et du Tésin;

»A la Hollande, la Belgique avec une frontière à déterminer à la
gauche de la Meuse;

»Enfin à la Prusse et autres États allemands qui ne sont point
nommés, pour leur servir de compensation et être partagés entre eux
dans une proportion qui n'est point indiquée, les pays entre la Meuse,
les frontières de la France et le Rhin.

»A l'autre classe appartient le reste des pays vacants, savoir:

»La partie indéterminée de l'État de Gênes qui n'est point destinée au
roi de Sardaigne; la partie du ci-devant royaume d'Italie, non
destinée à l'Autriche; Lucques; Piombino; les îles Ioniennes, le
grand-duché de Berg, tel qu'il existait avant le 1er janvier 1811;
l'Ost-Frise; toutes les provinces autrefois prussiennes qui faisaient
partie du royaume de Westphalie, la principauté d'Erfurt et la ville
de Dantzig.

»4º Le sort futur de l'île d'Elbe, qui, donnée à celui qui la possède
pour sa vie seulement, deviendra à sa mort un pays vacant;

»5º L'organisation de la confédération de l'Allemagne.

»Toutes choses qui devront être réglées de telle sorte qu'il en
résulte un équilibre réel, dans la composition duquel entreront, comme
parties nécessaires, l'organisation de la Suisse, sa neutralité
future, et l'intégrité des possessions ottomanes d'Europe, reconnues
et garanties.

»6º Les droits de péage sur le Rhin, l'Escaut et les autres fleuves
dont la navigation serait rendue libre.

»7º L'abolition universelle de la traite.

»On ne peut ni créer une obligation, ni ôter un droit certain à un
État qui n'y consent pas.

»Dans tous les cas où il s'agit de faire l'un ou l'autre, toutes les
puissances ensemble n'ont pas plus de pouvoir qu'une seule. Le
consentement de la partie intéressée étant nécessaire, il faut ou
l'obtenir, ou renoncer à ce qui, sans lui, ne saurait être juste. La
voie de la négociation est alors seule permise.

»La voie de décision est au contraire la seule qu'on puisse prendre
lorsque la compétence, une fois établie (et celle du congrès est une
conséquence non douteuse des principes exposés ci-dessus), il s'agit,
ou de constater un droit de souveraineté en litige, ou de disposer de
territoires qui n'appartiennent à personne, ou de régler l'exercice
d'un droit commun à plusieurs États qui, par un consentement formel,
l'ont subordonné à l'intérêt de tous. Car s'il fallait, dans le
premier cas, le consentement de celui dont le droit est déclaré nul,
dans le second, le consentement de tous ceux qui prétendent à un
territoire disponible, et dans le troisième, celui de tous les
intéressés, jamais différend ne pourrait être terminé, jamais
territoire vacant ne pourrait cesser de l'être, jamais droit dont
l'exercice serait à régler selon l'intérêt de tous, ne pourrait être
exercé.

»Le sort des États en litige,

»Les droits de succession douteux,

»La disposition des États vacants,

»Et les droits de péage à établir sur le Rhin,

»Doivent être réglés par voie de décision, avec cette différence qui
naît de la différence des objets, que, dans le premier cas, le litige
ne peut être terminé qu'autant que le droit de l'un de ceux entre
lesquels il existe, est unanimement reconnu; que, dans le second cas,
la décision doit être de même unanime; qu'elle doit l'être encore dans
le troisième, à part les voix des co-prétendants, qui ne doivent point
être comptées; et que, dans le quatrième cas, la majorité suffit.

«Les autres objets ne sauraient être réglés que par voie de
négociation.

»Le sort des pays qui ne sont ni vacants ni en litige, parce que, pour
en disposer autrement qu'en les rendant à leurs souverains respectifs,
le consentement de ceux-ci est nécessaire;

»L'organisation de la confédération germanique, parce que cette
organisation sera, pour les États allemands, une loi qui ne leur peut
être imposée sans leur consentement;

»L'abolition de la traite, parce que c'est jusqu'ici une matière
étrangère au droit public de l'Europe, sous lequel les Anglais veulent
maintenant la placer;

»D'environ cent soixante-dix millions d'habitants que l'Europe
chrétienne renferme, plus des deux tiers appartiennent à la France et
aux sept États qui ont signé avec elle le traité du 30 mai, et la
moitié de l'autre tiers à des pays sous la conquête, qui, n'ayant
point été engagés dans la guerre, n'auront point de ministres au
congrès. Le surplus forme la population de plus de quarante États dont
quelques-uns seraient à peine la centième partie du plus petit de ceux
qui ont signé le traité du 30 mai, et qui, réunis tous, ne feraient
point une puissance égale aux grandes puissances de l'Europe. Quelle
part auront-ils aux délibérations? Quelle part au droit de suffrage?
Auront-ils chacun une part égale à celle des plus grands États? Ce
serait choquer la nature des choses. N'auront-ils qu'une voix en
commun? Ils ne parviendraient jamais à la former. N'en auront-ils
aucune? Mieux vaudrait alors ne les point admettre. Mais qui
exclura-t-on? Les ministres du pape, de Sicile, de Sardaigne? ou celui
de Hollande, ou celui de Saxe? ou seulement ceux qui ne le sont point
de têtes couronnées? Mais qui cédera pour ces princes, s'ils doivent
céder? Qui donnera pour eux, à une obligation qu'il s'agirait de leur
imposer, le consentement qu'ils doivent donner? Disposera-t-on de
leurs États sans qu'ils les cèdent? Se passera-t-on de leur
consentement quand le droit public le rend nécessaire? Et l'Europe se
sera-t-elle réunie pour violer les principes de ce droit qui la régit?
Il importe bien plutôt de les remettre en vigueur, après qu'ils ont
été si longtemps méconnus et si cruellement violés. Un moyen simple de
concilier à la fois le droit et les convenances serait de mesurer la
part que les États de troisième et de quatrième ordre prendraient aux
arrangements à faire, non sur l'échelle de la puissance, mais sur
celle de leur intérêt.

»L'équilibre général de l'Europe ne peut être composé d'éléments
simples. Il ne peut l'être que de systèmes d'équilibres partiels. Les
petits ou moyens États ne prendraient part qu'à ce qui concerne le
système particulier auquel ils appartiennent: les États d'Italie aux
arrangements de l'Italie, et les États allemands aux arrangements de
l'Allemagne. Les grandes puissances seules, embrassant l'ensemble,
ordonneraient chacune des parties par rapport au tout.

«L'ordre dans lequel il paraît le plus naturel et le plus convenable
que les objets soient traités est celui dans lequel ils ont été
présentés ci-dessus. Il faut premièrement constater ce que chacun a et
ce qu'il doit garder, pour savoir s'il faut et ce qu'il faut lui
ajouter, et ne disposer qu'en connaissance de cause de ce qui est
disponible; répartir ensuite ce qui est à répartir, et fixer ainsi
l'état général de possession, premier principe de tout équilibre.
L'organisation de l'Allemagne ne peut venir qu'après, car il faudra
qu'elle soit relative à la force réciproque des États allemands, et
conséquemment, que cette force soit préalablement fixée. Enfin, les
garanties doivent suivre et non pas précéder les arrangements sur
lesquels elles portent.

»Il devra être tenu un protocole des délibérations, actes et décisions
du congrès.

»Ces décisions ne doivent être exprimées que dans le langage ordinaire
des traités. Pour rendre le royaume de Naples à Ferdinand IV, il
suffirait que le traité reconnût ce prince comme roi de Naples, ou
simplement le nommât avec ce titre de la manière suivante: «Sa Majesté
Ferdinand IV, roi de Naples et de Sicile.»

»De même, pour constater le droit de la maison de Carignan, le traité
n'aurait qu'à dire: «Telle partie de l'État de Gênes est réunie à
perpétuité aux États de Sa Majesté le roi de Sardaigne, pour être,
comme eux, possédée en toute propriété et souveraineté, et héréditaire
de mâle en mâle, par ordre de primogéniture, dans les deux branches de
sa maison.»

»Pour ce qui concerne le mode et les moyens d'exécution, une garantie
commune des droits reconnus suffit à tout, puisqu'elle oblige les
garants à soutenir ces droits et qu'elle ôte tout appui extérieur aux
prétentions qui leur sont opposées.

»Après avoir montré quels objets le congrès peut et doit régler, et
que sa compétence résulte des principes mêmes de droit qui doivent
servir à les régler, il reste à les considérer sous le rapport de
l'intérêt de la France, et à faire voir que la France est dans
l'heureuse situation de n'avoir point à désirer que la justice et
l'utilité soient divisées, et à chercher son utilité particulière hors
de la justice qui est l'utilité de tous.

»Une égalité absolue de forces entre tous les États, outre qu'elle ne
peut jamais exister, n'est point nécessaire à l'équilibre politique,
et lui serait peut-être, à certains égards, nuisible. Cet équilibre
consiste dans un rapport entre les forces de résistance et les forces
d'agression réciproques des divers corps politiques. Si l'Europe
était composée d'États qui eussent entre eux un tel rapport que le
minimum de la force de résistance du plus petit fût égal au maximum de
la force d'agression du plus grand, il y aurait alors un équilibre
réel, c'est-à-dire résultant de la nature des choses. Mais la
situation de l'Europe n'est point telle et ne peut le devenir. A côté
de grands territoires appartenant à une puissance unique, se trouvent
des territoires de même ou de moindre grandeur, divisés en un nombre
plus ou moins grand d'États, souvent de diverses natures. Unir ces
États par un lien fédératif est quelquefois impossible, et il l'est
toujours de donner à ceux qui sont unis ainsi la même unité de volonté
et la même puissance d'action que s'ils étaient un corps simple. Ils
n'entrent donc jamais dans la formation de l'équilibre général que
comme des éléments imparfaits; en leur qualité de corps composés, ils
ont leur équilibre propre, sujet à mille altérations qui affectent
nécessairement celui dont ils font partie.

»Une telle situation n'admet qu'un équilibre tout artificiel et
précaire, qui ne peut durer qu'autant que quelques grands États se
trouvent animés d'un esprit de modération et de justice qui le
conserve.

»Le système de conservation fut celui de la France, dans tout le cours
du siècle passé, jusqu'à l'époque des événements qui ont produit les
dernières guerres; et c'est celui que le roi veut constamment suivre.
Mais, avant de conserver, il faut établir.

»Si l'Autriche venait à demander la possession de toute l'Italie, il
n'y aurait sans doute personne qui ne se récriât à une telle demande,
qui ne la trouvât monstrueuse, et ne regardât l'union de l'Italie à
l'Autriche comme fatale à l'indépendance et à la sûreté de l'Europe.
Cependant, en donnant à l'Autriche toute l'Italie, on ne ferait
qu'assurer à celle-ci son indépendance. Une fois réunie en un seul
corps, l'Italie, à quelque titre qu'elle appartînt à l'Autriche, lui
échapperait, non pas tôt ou tard, mais en très peu d'années, peut-être
en peu de mois; et l'Autriche ne l'aurait acquise que pour la perdre.
Au contraire, que l'on divise le territoire italien en sept
territoires, dont les deux principaux sont aux extrémités, et les
quatre plus petits à côté du plus grand; que donnant celui-ci à
l'Autriche, et trois des plus petits à des princes de sa maison, on
lui laisse un prétexte à l'aide duquel elle puisse faire tomber le
quatrième en partage à l'un de ces princes; que le territoire à
l'autre extrémité soit occupé par un homme qui, à raison de sa
position personnelle vis-à-vis d'une partie des souverains de
l'Europe, ne puisse avoir d'espoir que dans l'Autriche, ni d'autre
appui qu'elle; que le septième territoire appartienne à un prince dont
toute la force réside dans le respect dû à son caractère, n'est-il pas
manifeste qu'en paraissant ne donner qu'une partie de l'Italie à
l'Autriche, on la lui aura en effet donné toute, et que son apparente
division en divers États ne serait, en réalité, qu'un moyen donné à
l'Autriche de posséder ce pays, de la seule manière dont elle puisse
le posséder, sans le perdre? Or, tel serait l'état de l'Italie, où
l'Autriche doit avoir pour limites le Pô, le lac Majeur et le Tésin,
si Modène, si Parme et Plaisance, si le grand-duché de Toscane,
avaient pour souverains des princes de sa maison, si le droit de
succession dans la maison de Sardaigne restait douteux, si celui qui
règne à Naples continuait d'y régner.

»L'Italie divisée en États non confédérés n'est point susceptible
d'une indépendance réelle, mais seulement d'une indépendance relative,
laquelle consiste à être soumise, non à une seule et même influence,
mais à plusieurs. Le rapport qui fait que ces influences se
contrebalancent est ce qui constitue son équilibre.

»Que l'existence de cet équilibre importe à l'Europe, c'est une chose
si évidente qu'on ne peut même la mettre en question; et il n'est pas
moins évident que, dans une situation de l'Italie, telle que celle qui
vient d'être représentée, toute espèce d'équilibre cesserait.

»Que faut-il, et que peut-on faire pour l'établir? Rien que la justice
n'exige ou n'autorise.

»Il faut rendre Naples à son légitime souverain;

»La Toscane à la reine d'Étrurie;

»Au Saint-Siège, non seulement les provinces sur l'Adriatique, qui
n'ont pas été cédées, mais aussi les légations de Ravenne et de
Bologne devenues vacantes;

»Piombino au prince de ce nom auquel il appartenait, ainsi que les
mines de l'île d'Elbe, sous la suzeraineté de la couronne de Naples,
et qui dépouillé de l'une et de l'autre propriété, sans aucune sorte
d'indemnité, a été réduit par là, à un état voisin de l'indigence[146];

  [146] La principauté de Piombino, enclavée dans la Toscane, avait
  environ quarante kilomètres carrés et vingt-cinq mille habitants.
  Elle appartenait autrefois à la famille Buoncompagni, qui l'avait
  achetée en 1634. Le prince de Piombino fut dépossédé en 1801.
  Bonaparte s'empara de la principauté et la donna à sa soeur la
  princesse Élisa Baciocchi. Le traité de Vienne la rendit à la
  famille Buoncompagni, et celle-ci la céda au grand-duc de Toscane
  moyennant quatre millions sept cent quatre mille francs.

»Mettre hors de doute les droits de la maison de Carignan et agrandir
la Sardaigne.

»Si l'on proposait à l'Europe rassemblée de déclarer:

»Que la souveraineté s'acquiert par le seul fait de la conquête, et
que le patrimoine d'un prince qui ne l'a perdu que par une suite de
son invariable fidélité à la cause de l'Europe doit, du consentement
de l'Europe, appartenir à celui entre les mains duquel les malheurs
seuls de l'Europe l'ont fait tomber, il est impossible de supposer
qu'une telle proposition ne serait pas repoussée à l'instant par un
cri de réprobation unanime. Tous sentiraient qu'elle ne tendrait à
rien moins qu'à renverser la seule barrière que l'indépendance
naturelle des peuples ait permis à la raison d'élever entre le droit
de souveraineté et la force, pour contenir l'une et préserver l'autre,
et qu'à saper les fondements de la morale même.

»C'est néanmoins ce que déclarerait implicitement le congrès s'il
était possible qu'il reconnût celui qui règne à Naples, comme
souverain de ce pays, et c'est encore ce qu'il serait censé avoir
déclaré, en ne reconnaissant pas en cette qualité Ferdinand IV. Car
les peuples ne comprendraient jamais qu'il eût consacré, par son
silence, la violation d'un principe si important pour tous les
souverains, et qu'il aurait tenu pour vrai. Ils en concluraient que ce
principe n'existe pas, et que la force seule est le droit.

»L'Autriche pourra objecter qu'elle a donné des garanties à celui qui
règne à Naples[147]. Mais l'acte par lequel on garantit à quelqu'un ce
qui n'est pas à lui, en admettant que la nécessité l'excuse, est tout
au moins un acte nul. Cette garantie d'ailleurs n'a pas été donnée
contre un jugement de l'Europe; elle ne l'a été que contre l'homme
contre lequel l'Europe était alors armée.

  [147] Murat avait signé, les 6 et 11 janvier 1814, deux traités,
  l'un avec l'Autriche, l'autre avec l'Angleterre, par lesquels ces
  deux puissances lui garantissaient ses États, et même lui
  promettaient un accroissement de territoire aux dépens des États de
  l'Église, moyennant quoi il s'engageait à joindre aux armées
  alliées trente mille hommes de ses troupes.

»Le mieux serait sans doute que celui qui règne à Naples n'obtînt
aucune souveraineté. Mais on parle de services rendus par lui à la
cause de l'Europe; s'il en a effectivement rendu, et s'il faut l'en
récompenser, ou si cela est nécessaire pour vaincre des difficultés,
les ambassadeurs du roi ne s'opposeront point à ce qu'on lui donne,
non ce qui est à d'autres, mais quelque chose de vacant, tel qu'une
partie des îles Ioniennes.

»Jamais droits ne furent plus légitimes que ceux de la reine d'Étrurie
sur la Toscane. Ce pays avait été cédé par son grand-duc, et Charles
IV l'avait acquis pour sa fille, en donnant en échange les duchés de
Parme, Plaisance et Guastalla et la Louisiane avec un certain nombre
de vaisseaux et de millions. Si, néanmoins, la restitution de la
Toscane offrait trop de difficultés, et si, en sa place, on offrait
les duchés de Parme, Plaisance et Guastalla, les ambassadeurs du roi
engageraient ceux d'Espagne à se contenter de cette offre et à
l'accepter.

»L'Autriche n'avait pas seulement garanti à celui qui règne à Naples
la possession de ce royaume; elle s'était engagée à lui procurer un
agrandissement jusqu'à concurrence d'un territoire de quatre à six
cent mille âmes. Les provinces du Saint-Siège sur l'Adriatique,
desquelles il avait été formé trois départements du royaume d'Italie,
ont été destinées pour servir à l'accomplissement de cette promesse,
et continuent, pour cette raison, d'être occupées par les troupes
napolitaines. Si, comme il faut l'espérer, celui qui règne à Naples
cesse d'y régner, il ne sera plus question de cette promesse, et la
difficulté que l'Autriche aurait à la tenir peut devenir pour elle un
motif d'abandonner celui à qui elle l'a faite. Mais dans tous les cas,
les ambassadeurs du roi seconderont de tous leurs efforts l'opposition
que l'ambassadeur de Sa Sainteté mettra, sans aucun doute, à ce que
ces provinces soient distraites du domaine pontifical. Ils
contribueront pareillement, autant qu'il dépendra d'eux, à faire
restituer au Saint-Siège les légations de Ravenne et de Bologne. Celle
de Ferrare étant comprise dans ce qui est destiné par le traité du 30
mai à l'Autriche, sa restitution peut éprouver de grandes et même
d'insurmontables difficultés. Mais si quelque arrangement pouvait la
faciliter, pourvu qu'il ne fût point de nature à augmenter l'influence
autrichienne en Italie, les ambassadeurs du roi y donneraient les
mains.

»Le prince de Piombino, quoique simple feudataire de la couronne de
Naples, ayant été dépouillé, comme s'il eût été prince souverain, doit
être rétabli dans tous les droits dont la violence l'avait privé.

»Ceux de la maison de Carignan ont été exposés avec assez de détail
pour qu'il ne soit pas nécessaire d'en parler de nouveau. Ce n'est que
dans la supposition que ces droits soient mis hors de tout doute, que
la Sardaigne peut être agrandie; mais alors, il est à désirer qu'elle
le soit, autant que le permettra la quotité des pays disponibles, afin
d'accroître d'autant plus, et d'assurer son indépendance.

»En Italie, c'est l'Autriche qu'il faut empêcher de dominer, en
opposant à son influence des influences contraires; en Allemagne,
c'est la Prusse. La constitution physique de sa monarchie lui fait de
l'ambition une sorte de nécessité. Tout prétexte lui est bon. Nul
scrupule ne l'arrête. La convenance est son droit. C'est ainsi que
dans un cours de soixante-trois années, elle a porté sa population de
moins de quatre millions de sujets à dix millions, et qu'elle est
parvenue à se former, si l'on peut ainsi parler, un cadre de monarchie
immense, acquérant, çà et là, des territoires épars, qu'elle tend à
réunir en s'incorporant ceux qui les séparent. La chute terrible que
lui a attirée son ambition ne l'en a pas corrigée. En ce moment, ses
émissaires et ses partisans agitent l'Allemagne, lui peignent la
France comme prête à l'envahir encore, la Prusse, comme seule en état
de la défendre, et demandent qu'on la lui livre pour la préserver.
Elle aurait voulu avoir la Belgique. Elle veut avoir tout ce qui est
entre les frontières actuelles de la France, la Meuse et le Rhin. Elle
veut Luxembourg. Tout est perdu si Mayence ne lui est pas donné. Elle
ne peut avoir de sécurité si elle ne possède pas la Saxe. Les alliés
ont, dit-on, pris l'arrangement de la replacer dans le même état de
puissance où elle était avant sa chute, c'est-à-dire avec dix millions
de sujets. Qu'on la laissât faire, bientôt elle en aurait vingt, et
l'Allemagne tout entière lui serait soumise. Il est donc nécessaire de
mettre un frein à son ambition, en restreignant d'abord, autant qu'il
est possible, son état de possession en Allemagne, et, ensuite, en
restreignant son influence par l'organisation fédérale.

»Son état de possession sera restreint par la conservation de tous les
petits États et par l'agrandissement des États moyens.

»Tous les petits États doivent être conservés par la raison seule
qu'ils existent, à la seule exception de la principauté ecclésiastique
d'Aschaffenbourg, dont la conservation paraît incompatible avec le
plan général de distribution des territoires; mais une existence
honorable doit être assurée au possesseur.

»Si tous les petits États doivent être conservés, à plus forte raison
le royaume de Saxe. Le roi de Saxe a gouverné pendant quarante ans ses
sujets en père, donnant l'exemple des vertus de l'homme et du prince.
Assailli pour la première fois par la tempête, à un âge avancé qui
devait être celui du repos, et relevé incontinent par la main qui
l'avait abattu, et qui en avait écrasé tant d'autres, s'il a eu des
torts, ils doivent être imputés à une crainte légitime, ou à un
sentiment toujours honorable pour celui qui l'éprouve, quel qu'en soit
l'objet. Ceux qui lui en reprochent en ont eu de bien réels et
d'incomparablement plus grands, sans avoir les mêmes excuses. Ce qui
lui a été donné l'a été sans qu'il l'eût demandé, sans qu'il l'eût
désiré, sans même qu'il le sût. Il a supporté la prospérité avec
modération, et maintenant il supporte le malheur avec dignité. A ces
motifs, qui suffiraient seuls pour porter le roi à ne le point
abandonner, se joignent les liens de parenté qui les unissent[148] et
la nécessité d'empêcher que la Saxe ne tombe en partage à la Prusse,
qui ferait par une telle acquisition, un pas immense et décisif vers
la domination absolue en Allemagne.

  [148] Louis XVIII était par sa mère, Marie-Josèphe de Saxe, cousin
  germain du roi Frédéric-Auguste.

»Cette nécessité est telle que, si, dans une hypothèse dont il sera
parlé ci-après, le roi de Saxe se trouvait appelé à la possession d'un
autre royaume, il faudrait que celui de Saxe ne cessât point
d'exister, et fût donné à la branche ducale, ce qui devrait convenir
particulièrement à l'empereur de Russie, puisque son beau-frère, le
prince héréditaire de Weimar, s'en trouverait alors le présomptif
héritier.

»Les ambassadeurs du roi défendront, en conséquence, de tous leurs
moyens la cause du roi de Saxe, et, dans tous les cas, feront tout ce
qui est en eux pour que la Saxe ne devienne point une province
prussienne.

»De même qu'il faut que la Prusse ne puisse acquérir la Saxe, de même
il faut empêcher qu'elle n'acquière Mayence, ni même aucune portion
quelconque du territoire à la gauche de la Moselle; aider la Hollande
à porter, aussi loin qu'il sera possible de la rive droite de la
Meuse, la frontière qu'elle doit avoir sur cette rive; seconder les
demandes d'accroissement que feront la Bavière, la Hesse, le Brunswick
et particulièrement le Hanovre (bien entendu que ces demandes ne
porteront que sur des objets vacants), afin de rendre d'autant plus
petite la partie des pays disponibles qui restera pour la Prusse.

»Les alliés ont, dit-on, un plan d'après lequel Luxembourg et Mayence
seraient en commun à la confédération, et seraient occupés par des
troupes fédérales. Ce plan semble convenir aux intérêts personnels de
la France, et, par cette raison, les ambassadeurs du roi devront, en
l'appuyant, éviter de le faire de manière à élever des soupçons.

»Toute confédération est une république, et, pour être bien
constituée, doit en avoir l'esprit. Voilà pourquoi une confédération
de princes ne peut jamais être bien constituée, car l'esprit de la
république tend à l'égalité, et celui du monarque, à l'indépendance.
Mais la question n'est pas de donner à la confédération allemande une
organisation parfaite; il suffit de lui en donner une qui ait l'effet
d'empêcher:

»1º L'oppression des sujets dans les petits États;

»2º L'oppression des petits États par les grands;

»3º Et l'influence de ceux-ci, de se changer en domination, de telle
sorte que l'un d'eux ou plusieurs puissent disposer, pour leurs fins
particulières, de la force de tous.

»Or, ces effets ne peuvent être obtenus qu'en divisant le pouvoir, et
dans les petits États, et dans la confédération, si on le concentre
dans celle-ci, en le faisant changer de mains, et passer
successivement par le plus de mains qu'il est possible.

»Voilà tout ce qui peut être dit ici sur la future organisation
fédérale de l'Allemagne. Les ambassadeurs du roi n'auront point à en
faire le plan. Il leur suffit de savoir dans quel esprit il devra être
fait, et d'après quelle règle devront être jugés ceux sur lesquels ils
seront appelés à délibérer.

»Le rétablissement du royaume de Pologne serait un bien et un très
grand bien; mais seulement sous les trois conditions suivantes:

»1º Qu'il fût indépendant;

»2º Qu'il eût une constitution forte;

»3º Qu'il ne fallût pas compenser à la Prusse et à l'Autriche la part
qui leur en était respectivement échue;

»Conditions qui sont toutes impossibles, et la seconde plus que les
deux autres.

»D'abord, la Russie ne veut pas le rétablissement de la Pologne pour
perdre ce qu'elle en a acquis. Elle le veut pour acquérir ce qu'elle
n'en possède pas. Or, rétablir la Pologne pour la donner tout entière
à la Russie, pour porter la population de celle-ci, en Europe, à
quarante-quatre millions de sujets, et ses frontières jusqu'à l'Oder,
ce serait créer pour l'Europe un danger, et si grand, si imminent,
que, quoiqu'il faille tout faire pour conserver la paix, si
l'exécution d'un tel plan ne pouvait être arrêtée que par la force des
armes, il ne faudrait pas balancer un seul moment à les prendre. On
espérerait vainement que la Pologne, ainsi unie à la Russie, s'en
détacherait d'elle-même. Il n'est pas certain qu'elle le voulût; il
est moins certain encore qu'elle le pût, et il est certain que si elle
le voulait et le pouvait un moment, elle n'échapperait au joug que
pour le porter de nouveau. Car la Pologne, rendue à l'indépendance, le
serait invinciblement à l'anarchie. La grandeur du pays exclut
l'aristocratie proprement dite, et il ne peut exister de monarchie où
le peuple soit sans liberté civile, et où les nobles aient la liberté
politique, ou soient indépendants et où l'anarchie ne règne pas. La
raison seule le dit, et l'histoire de toute l'Europe le prouve. Or,
comment, en rétablissant la Pologne, ôter la liberté politique aux
nobles, ou donner la liberté civile au peuple? Celle-ci ne saurait
être donnée par une déclaration, par une loi. Elle n'est qu'un vain
nom, si le peuple, à qui on la donne, n'a pas des moyens d'existence
indépendants, des propriétés, de l'industrie, des arts, ce qu'aucune
déclaration ni aucune loi ne peut donner, et ce qui ne peut être
l'ouvrage que du temps. L'anarchie était un état d'où la Pologne ne
pouvait sortir qu'à l'aide du pouvoir absolu; et comme elle n'avait
point chez elle les éléments de ce pouvoir, il fallait qu'il lui vînt
du dehors tout formé, c'est-à-dire qu'elle tombât sous la conquête.
Elle y est tombée dès que ses voisins l'ont voulu, et les progrès
qu'ont fait celles de ses parties qui sont échues à des peuples plus
avancés dans la civilisation prouvent qu'il a été heureux pour elles
d'y tomber. Qu'on la rende à l'indépendance, qu'on lui donne un roi,
non plus électif, mais héréditaire; que l'on y ajoute toutes les
institutions qu'on pourra imaginer; moins elles seront libres, et plus
elles seront opposées au génie, aux habitudes, aux souvenirs des
nobles qu'il y faudra soumettre par la force, et la force, où la
prendra-t-on? Et d'un autre côté, plus elles seront libres, et plus
inévitablement la Pologne sera plongée de nouveau dans l'anarchie,
pour finir de nouveau par la conquête. C'est qu'il y a dans ce pays
comme deux peuples pour lesquels il faudrait deux institutions qui
s'excluent l'une l'autre. Ne pouvant faire que ces deux peuples n'en
soient qu'un, ni créer le seul pouvoir qui peut concilier tout; ne
pouvant d'un autre côté, sans un péril évident pour l'Europe, donner
toute la Pologne à la Russie (et ce serait la lui donner toute que
d'ajouter seulement le duché de Varsovie à, ce qu'elle possède déjà),
que peut-on faire de mieux que de remettre les choses dans l'état où
elles avaient été par le dernier partage? Cela convient d'autant plus
que cela mettrait fin aux prétentions de la Prusse sur le royaume de
Saxe; car ce n'est qu'à titre de compensation, pour ce qu'elle ne
recouvrerait pas, dans l'hypothèse du rétablissement de la Pologne,
qu'elle ose demander la Saxe.

»L'Autriche demanderait sûrement aussi qu'on lui compensât les cinq
millions de sujets que contiennent les deux Gallicies, ou, si elle ne
le demandait pas, elle en deviendrait bien plus forte dans toutes les
questions d'Italie.

»Si néanmoins, contre toute probabilité, l'empereur de Russie
consentait à renoncer à ce qu'il possède de la Pologne (et il est
vraisemblable qu'il ne le pourrait pas, sans s'exposer à des dangers
personnels du côté des Russes), et si l'on voulait faire un essai, le
roi, sans en attendre un résultat heureux, n'y mettrait aucune
opposition. Dans ce cas, il serait désirable que le roi de Saxe, déjà
souverain du duché de Varsovie, dont le père et les aïeux ont occupé
le trône de Pologne, et dont la fille avait été appelée à porter le
sceptre polonais en dot à son époux, fût fait roi de Pologne.

»Mais, en exceptant le cas où la Pologne pourrait être rétablie dans
une indépendance entière de chacune des trois cours copartageantes, la
seule proposition admissible et la seule à laquelle le roi puisse
consentir, c'est (sauf quelques rectifications de frontières) de tout
rétablir en Pologne sur le pied du dernier partage.

»En restant partagée, la Pologne ne sera point anéantie pour toujours.
Les Polonais ne formant plus une société politique formeront toujours
une famille. Ils n'auront plus une même patrie, mais ils auront une
même langue. Ils resteront donc unis par le plus fort et le plus
durable de tous les liens. Ils parviendront, sous des dominations
étrangères, à l'âge viril auquel ils n'ont pu arriver en neuf siècles
d'indépendance, et le moment où ils l'auront atteint ne sera pas loin
de celui où, émancipés, ils se rattacheront tous à un même centre.

»Dantzig doit suivre le sort de la Pologne dont elle n'était qu'un
entrepôt; redevenir libre, si la Pologne redevient indépendante; ou
rentrer sous la domination de la Prusse, si l'ancien partage est
maintenu.

»Un emploi qui pourrait être fait des îles Ioniennes a déjà été
indiqué. Il importe que ces îles, et surtout celle de Corfou,
n'appartiennent ni à l'Angleterre ni à la Russie qui les convoitent,
ni à l'Autriche. Corfou est la clef du golfe Adriatique. Si, à la
possession de Gibraltar et de Malte, l'Angleterre ajoutait celle de
Corfou, elle serait maîtresse absolue de la Méditerranée. Les îles
Ioniennes formeraient pour les Russes un point d'agression contre
l'empire ottoman, et un point d'appui pour soulever les Grecs. Entre
les mains de l'Autriche, Corfou servirait à établir et à consolider sa
domination sur l'Italie.

»L'ordre de Saint-Jean de Jérusalem est sans chef-lieu et pour ainsi
dire, sans asile, depuis qu'il a perdu Malte. Les puissances
catholiques ont intérêt à ce qu'il soit relevé et sorte de ses ruines.
Il est vrai qu'il a cédé Malte, mais il est également vrai qu'il ne la
cédée qu'à la suite d'une invasion qu'aucun motif de droit ou même
d'utilité ne justifiait ni n'excusait. Il serait de l'honneur de
l'Angleterre, qui, par événement, profite de l'injustice, de
contribuer à la réparer, en s'unissant aux puissances catholiques pour
faire obtenir à l'ordre un dédommagement. On pourrait lui donner
Corfou, sans compromettre les intérêts d'aucun État de la chrétienté.
Il en demandera la possession, et les ambassadeurs du roi appuieront
cette demande.

»L'île d'Elbe, comme possession qui, à la mort de celui qui la possède
maintenant, deviendra vacante, et pour l'époque où elle le sera,
pourrait être rendue à ses anciens maîtres, la Toscane et Naples, ou
donnée à la Toscane seule.

»Le sort de tous les pays sous la conquête, de ceux qui ne sont point
vacants, de ceux qui le sont, et de ceux qui peuvent le devenir,
serait ainsi complètement réglé.

»Dans une partie de ces pays, des Français possédaient, à titre de
dotation, des biens que le traité du 30 mai leur a fait perdre. Cette
disposition rigoureuse, et qui pourrait être considérée comme injuste,
relativement aux dotations situées dans des pays qui avaient été
cédés, a été aggravée par l'effet rétroactif qu'on lui a donné, en
l'appliquant aux fermages et revenus échus. Les ambassadeurs du roi
réclameront contre cette injustice, et feront tout ce qui peut
dépendre d'eux pour qu'elle soit réparée. Les souverains alliés ayant
donné lieu d'espérer qu'ils feraient, et quelques-uns ayant déjà fait
des exceptions à la clause qui prive les donataires de leurs
dotations, les ambassadeurs du roi feront encore tout ce qui dépendra
d'eux pour que cette faveur soit étendue et accordée à autant de
donataires qu'il sera possible.

»Pour ce qui est des droits de navigation sur le Rhin et l'Escaut,
comme ils doivent être les mêmes pour tous, la France n'a rien à
désirer, sinon qu'ils soient très modérés. Par la libre navigation du
Rhin et de l'Escaut, la France aura les avantages que lui eût donnés
la possession des pays traversés par ces fleuves, et auxquels elle a
renoncé, et n'aura point les charges de la possession. Elle ne pourra
donc plus raisonnablement la regretter.

»La question de l'abolition de la traite est décidée relativement à la
France, qui, sur ce point, n'a plus de concessions à faire; car si
l'on demandait d'ôter, ou même simplement d'abréger le délai convenu,
elle ne pourrait y consentir. Mais le roi a promis d'unir tous ses
efforts à ceux de l'Angleterre pour obtenir que l'abolition
universelle de la traite soit prononcée. Il faut acquitter cette
promesse, et parce qu'elle est faite, et parce qu'il importe à la
France d'avoir l'Angleterre pour elle dans les questions qui
l'intéressent le plus.

»L'Angleterre, qui s'est livrée hors de l'Europe à l'esprit de
conquête, porte dans les affaires de l'Europe l'esprit de
conservation. Cela tient peut-être uniquement à sa position insulaire
qui ne permet pas qu'aucun territoire soit ajouté au sien, et à sa
faiblesse relative qui ne lui permettrait pas de garder sur le
continent des conquêtes qu'elle y aurait faites. Mais, que ce soit en
elle ou nécessité ou vertu, elle s'est montrée animée de l'esprit de
conservation, même à l'égard de la France sa rivale, et sous les
règnes d'Henri VIII, d'Élisabeth, de la reine Anne, et peut-être aussi
à une époque bien plus récente.

»La France ne portant au congrès que des vues toutes conservatrices, a
donc lieu d'espérer que l'Angleterre la secondera, pourvu qu'elle
satisfasse elle-même l'Angleterre sur les points qu'elle a le plus à
coeur, et l'Angleterre n'a rien tant à coeur que l'abolition de la
traite. Ce qui n'était peut-être dans le principe qu'une affaire
d'intérêt et de calcul, est devenu dans le peuple anglais une passion
portée jusqu'au fanatisme, et que le ministère n'est plus libre de
contrarier. C'est pourquoi les ambassadeurs du roi donneront toute
satisfaction à l'Angleterre sur ce point, en se prononçant franchement
et avec force pour l'abolition de la traite. Mais si l'Espagne et le
Portugal, qui sont les seules puissances qui n'aient point encore pris
d'engagement à cet égard, ne consentaient à cesser la traite qu'à
l'expiration d'un délai de plus de cinq années, et que ce délai fût
accordé, les ambassadeurs du roi, feraient en sorte que la France fût
admise à en jouir.

»Les présentes instructions ne sont point données aux ambassadeurs du
roi comme une règle absolue, de laquelle ils ne puissent s'écarter en
aucun point. Ils pourront céder ce qui est d'un intérêt moindre, pour
obtenir ce qui est d'un intérêt plus grand. Les points qui importent
le plus à la France, classés suivant l'ordre de leur importance
relative, sont ceux-ci:

»1º Qu'il ne soit laissé à l'Autriche aucune chance de pouvoir faire
tomber entre les mains d'un des princes de sa maison, c'est-à-dire
entre les siennes, les États du roi de Sardaigne;

»2º Que Naples soit restitué à Ferdinand IV;

»3º Que la Pologne entière ne passe point, et ne puisse point passer
sous la souveraineté de la Russie;

»4º Que la Prusse n'acquière ni le royaume de Saxe, du moins en
totalité, ni Mayence.

»En faisant des concessions sur les autres objets, les ambassadeurs du
roi ne les feront porter que sur ce qui est de simple utilité, et non
sur ce qui est d'obligation; premièrement, parce que pour la presque
totalité des objets à régler par le congrès, le droit résulte d'un
seul et même principe, et que, l'abandonner pour un point, ce serait
l'abandonner pour tous; en second lieu, parce que les derniers temps
ont laissé des impressions qu'il importe d'effacer. La France est un
État si puissant, que les autres peuples ne peuvent être rassurés que
par l'idée de sa modération, idée qu'ils prendront d'autant plus
facilement qu'elle leur en aura donné une plus grande de sa justice.

»Le roi devant avoir au congrès plusieurs organes de sa volonté, qui
doit être une, son intention est qu'il ne puisse être fait aucune
ouverture, proposition ou concession que d'après l'opinion de son
ministre des affaires étrangères, qui lui-même doit se rendre à
Vienne, et qu'autant que celui-ci aura décidé que de telles
ouvertures, propositions et concessions doivent être faites.

INSTRUCTIONS SUPPLÉMENTAIRES

DU ROI POUR SES AMBASSADEURS ET MINISTRES PLÉNIPOTENTIAIRES AU CONGRÈS
DE VIENNE

«Le roi, conformément aux instructions remises à ses ministres
plénipotentiaires partant pour le congrès de Vienne, et informé par
leur correspondance d'un concert formé entre la Russie et la Prusse,
pour rétablir le simulacre d'une Pologne sous la dépendance russe, et
pour agrandir la Prusse par la Saxe, a jugé convenable de faire
adresser à ses plénipotentiaires les instructions supplémentaires
suivantes:

»Comme il paraît que les mêmes raisons qui ont fait penser à Sa
Majesté que l'agrandissement de la Russie par la Pologne soumise à sa
dépendance et la réunion de la Saxe à la monarchie prussienne,
seraient également contraires aux principes de justice et de droit
public, et à l'établissement d'un système d'équilibre solide et
durable en Europe, ont été prises en considération par d'autres
puissances, et qu'il serait possible de ramener la Russie et la Prusse
peut-être sans troubler la paix, à des vues plus modérées et plus
conformes à l'intérêt général de l'Europe, par un concert formé en
opposition de celui qui subsiste entre elles; Sa Majesté autorise ses
plénipotentiaires à déclarer aux plénipotentiaires autrichiens et
bavarois, que leurs cours peuvent compter de sa part sur la
coopération militaire la plus active, pour s'opposer aux vues de la
Russie et de la Prusse, tant sur la Pologne que sur la Saxe. Les
ministres plénipotentiaires du roi pourront confier le contenu de la
présente instruction aux plénipotentiaires anglais, s'ils estiment
que cela puisse déterminer le cabinet de Saint-James à agir de concert
avec la France, l'Autriche et la Bavière, ou du moins, à rester
neutre. Il sera surtout bon de faire cette confidence au comte de
Munster[149], plénipotentiaire hanovrien.

  [149] Ernest-Frédéric, comte de Munster, né à Osnabrück (Hanovre)
  en 1766, devint conseiller intime de l'électeur de Hanovre, roi
  d'Angleterre. En 1797, il fut nommé ministre à Pétersbourg. Lorsque
  le Hanovre tomba aux mains de Napoléon, Munster se réfugia à
  Londres. Le roi George lui confia alors diverses missions
  diplomatiques importantes. En 1814, il représenta l'électorat de
  Hanovre au congrès de Vienne, et l'année suivante il fut mis à la
  tête du gouvernement hanovrien. Il resta en charge jusqu'en 1830,
  et mourut en 1841.

APPENDICE I[150]

  [150] Voir page 152.

Nous donnons ici sur la mission de M. de Vitrolles, en 1814, un récit
fait par M. le duc de Dalberg. Ce document, écrit en entier de la main
du duc, a été trouvé dans les papiers du prince de Talleyrand.

    La mission de M. de Vitrolles au congrès de Châtillon ne fut
    conçue que dans un _système d'information_ qu'on désirait
    recevoir à Paris sur le but final des alliés à l'égard de
    l'empereur.

    Il n'existait à Paris ni plan ni conspiration contre l'empereur;
    mais la conviction était unanime que son pouvoir était miné par
    ses folies et ses extravagances, et que lui-même serait la
    victime de sa folle résistance et de son système de continuelle
    déception.

    L'inquiétude sur l'avenir était croissante.

    Le baron Louis dit un jour à M. de Dalberg: «L'homme (en
    désignant l'empereur), est un cadavre, mais il ne pue pas
    encore; voilà le fait.» Les ennemis étaient alors à trente
    lieues de Paris.

    On avait eu connaissance à Paris de propos tenus par l'empereur
    Alexandre à la grande-duchesse de Bade, des insinuations faites;
    par lui à Bernadotte et à Eugène de Beauharnais.

    On soupçonnait les menées de Fouché avec la famille Murat dans
    le Midi, approchait le duc d'Angoulême; le duc de Berry
    intriguait en Bretagne; le comte d'Artois s'était rapproché de
    la frontière de l'Allemagne et se trouvait à Bâle; des
    mouvements avaient eu lieu à Vesoul et à Troyes! On était
    tellement fatigué en France de l'excès du despotisme militaire
    de l'empereur, et on espérait si peu de concessions de sa part,
    qu'il importait de connaître jusqu'où la crise amenée par lui
    entraînerait la France et l'Europe. Ce n'était plus une guerre
    ordinaire; les nations étaient en mouvement. Cette situation
    alarmait tous les esprits: de tous côtés, on cherchait la
    solution de cet état de choses.

    On avait la communication des gazettes anglaises par M. Martin,
    commissaire de police à Boulogne, qui les envoyait à M. de
    Pradt. Dans les ministères de la guerre et des affaires
    étrangères, il avait été défendu de les communiquer, nommément à
    M. de Talleyrand.

    Ce dernier désira connaître ce que les puissances alliées
    voulaient en dernier résultat. Il en parla à M. de Dalberg;
    l'avis de ce dernier était qu'on l'obtiendrait en envoyant
    quelque agent à M. de Stadion ou à M. de Nesselrode.

    On fit choix de M. de Vitrolles, ami de M. Mollien et de M.
    d'Hauterive, homme à cette époque très prononcé pour les progrès
    des idées constitutionnelles sur lesquelles il avait écrit une
    très bonne brochure qu'il publia plus tard.

    M. de Vitrolles partit; ses instructions se bornèrent à ceci: il
    devait aller à Châtillon, exposer à M. le comte de Stadion ou à
    M. de Nesselrode le danger qui existait pour tout le monde de ne
    rien prononcer de définitif, et revenir à Paris porter la
    réponse sur la question du maintien du pouvoir de l'empereur.

    M. de Vitrolles, croyant avoir plus de facilités d'arriver à
    Châtillon par la route du nord et en tournant les armées,
    n'arriva à Châtillon que vers le 10 mars 1814.

    Il se présenta chez M. de Stadion, et s'accrédita auprès de lui
    au moyen de deux noms tracés sur son album, de la main de M. de
    Dalberg (c'étaient les noms de deux dames qui étaient soeurs, et
    que l'écrivain et le lecteur avaient connues à Vienne).

    Il déclara à M. de Stadion que l'état des esprits en France et
    les dispositions de _plusieurs personnes_ désiraient un
    changement et des garanties législatives contre les violences et
    le caractère de l'empereur, qu'il était important de former un
    prompt arrangement pour que la guerre ne prit point une
    direction qui éloignât pour longtemps la paix.

    M. de Stadion l'engagea à se rendre à Troyes où était le cabinet
    politique des alliés, et où se trouvaient les empereurs et le
    roi de Prusse.

    Il partit avec un billet de M. de Stadion pour M. de Metternich.
    Celui-ci lui dit:

    «Qu'il voulait, sans détour, lui faire connaître toute la pensée
    des puissances: qu'elles reconnaissaient que Bonaparte était un
    homme avec lequel il était impossible de continuer à traiter,
    que le jour où il avait des revers il paraissait accéder à tout,
    que lorsqu'il obtenait un léger succès, il revenait à des
    prétentions aussi exagérées qu'inadmissibles; qu'on voulait donc
    établir en France un autre souverain et régler les choses de
    manière que l'Autriche, la Russie et la France fussent des pays
    d'une égale force; que la Prusse devait rester une puissance
    moitié moins forte que chacune des trois autres; qu'à l'égard du
    nouveau souverain à établir en France, il n'était pas possible
    de penser aux Bourbons à cause du personnel de ces princes.»

    Il faut dire ici que M. de Vitrolles avait pour système que la
    France et l'Europe ne seraient tranquilles que par le
    rétablissement de la maison de Bourbon, avec une charte qui
    garantirait la jouissance des libertés publiques à la France.

    Il était lié avec madame Étienne de Durfort, et par elle il
    avait reçu, en partant, un mot pour M. le comte d'Artois qui
    pouvait le faire arriver à sa personne et en être traité avec
    confiance.

    M. de Vitrolles vit M. de Nesselrode après avoir entretenu le
    prince de Metternich. Il en reçut à peu près les mêmes
    informations. On lui dit, en même temps, que rien ne pouvait
    empêcher les alliés d'agir uniformément et d'un commun accord
    jusqu'à ce que la paix générale fût arrêtée sur ces bases;
    qu'aucune intrigue ne serait écoutée.

    Au bout de quelques jours, M. de Vitrolles sollicita de M. de
    Nesselrode pour être admis directement auprès de l'empereur de
    Russie. Le ministre lui dit qu'il y avait déjà pensé lui-même et
    que ce serait peut-être assez difficile; il obtint néanmoins
    pour M. de Vitrolles cette audience, en lui indiquant que M. de
    Vitrolles était en relation avec M. de Talleyrand, M. de Pradt,
    M. de Dalberg. L'empereur répéta à peu près les mêmes choses que
    les ministres: il dit qu'il avait pensé d'abord à établir en
    France Bernadotte, ensuite à y placer Beauharnais; mais que
    différents motifs s'y opposaient; qu'au reste l'intention était
    surtout de consulter le voeu des Français eux-mêmes, et que même
    dans le cas où ceux-ci voudraient se constituer en _république_
    on ne s'y opposerait peut-être pas.

    L'empereur s'étendit plus encore que les plénipotentiaires sur
    l'impossibilité de penser aux Bourbons et sur le mal que les
    souverains avaient dit d'eux.

    M. de Vitrolles (suivant lui) eut ici une inspiration subite, il
    invita l'empereur, au lieu de suivre les opérations ordinaires
    de la guerre, à marcher sur-le-champ à Paris; qu'il y jugerait
    de la disposition des esprits.

    _M. Pozzo di Borgo assure_ de son côté que c'est lui qui a
    déterminé l'empereur à cette marche, et des personnes informées
    m'ont dit que l'empereur avait prononcé qu'on ne déciderait rien
    avant de s'être concerté avec M. de Talleyrand, et qu'on eût
    pris ses avis sur l'avenir de la France.

    M. de Vitrolles quittant l'empereur, celui-ci lui dit:
    «Monsieur, notre conversation d'aujourd'hui aura de gros
    résultats pour l'Europe; je pars demain en personne pour le
    quartier général.»

    Il partit en effet le lendemain pour conférer avec le prince de
    Schwarzenberg.

    Après la prise de Paris, M. de Nesselrode se rendit, le matin,
    chez M. de Talleyrand, où M. de Dalberg fut appelé. L'empereur
    entra à midi dans Paris et se logea chez M. de Talleyrand.

    M. de Vitrolles vit également l'empereur d'Autriche, qui lui dit
    qu'il allait se rendre à Dijon, que l'empereur de Russie et le
    roi de Prusse prendraient à Paris le parti que les circonstances
    indiqueraient, et qu'il s'y rendrait après.

    M. de Vitrolles, au lieu de retourner à Paris, se rendit auprès
    de _Monsieur_. Il apprit en chemin que Bonaparte avait eu
    quelques nouveaux succès, que les négociations à Châtillon en
    avaient ressenti l'effet, et que M. le comte d'Artois était à
    Nancy. Il y arriva le 23 mars.

    Il ne donna aucune de ses nouvelles à Paris où il n'arriva que
    plusieurs jours après les alliés, et après avoir écrit à M. de
    Talleyrand une lettre au nom de _Monsieur_, qui blâmait que l'on
    eût laissé exprimer au sénat des voeux pour un régime
    constitutionnel.

Le lendemain de la séance du Sénat, M. Talleyrand recevait de Benjamin
Constant la lettre suivante. Cette lettre a été trouvée dans les
papiers du prince de Talleyrand.

     «Vous avez glorieusement expliqué une longue énigme, et quelque
     bizarre, quelque inconvenante que soit peut-être cette manière
     de vous en féliciter, je ne puis résister au besoin de vous
     remercier d'avoir à la fois brisé la tyrannie et jeté des bases
     de liberté. Sans l'un, je n'aurais pu vous rendre grâce de
     l'autre. 1789 et 1814 se tiennent noblement dans votre vie.
     Vous ressemblerez dans l'histoire à Maurice de Saxe, et vous ne
     mourrez pas au moment du succès. Vous n'accuserez pas cet
     hommage de s'adresser à la prospérité seule. Le passé doit me
     préserver de ce soupçon. Il n'y a pas non plus d'intérêt
     personnel dans ma démarche. Pour fuir un joug que je ne pouvais
     briser, j'avais quitté la France, et bien que je m'en sois
     rapproché pour tenter de la servir, des liens que je chéris
     tendent à me fixer ailleurs. Mais il est doux d'exprimer son
     admiration, quand on l'éprouve pour un homme qui est en même
     temps le sauveur et le plus aimable des Français; j'écris ces
     mots après avoir lu les bases de la constitution décrétée.

     »Pardon si je n'ajoute aucun de vos titres; l'Europe et
     l'histoire vous les donneront avec bonheur. Mais le plus beau
     sera toujours celui de président du Sénat.

     »Hommage et respect,

     »BENJAMIN CONSTANT.

     »Le 3 avril 1814.»

La lettre suivante fut adressée par Fouché à l'empereur, au moment où
celui-ci venait d'accepter la souveraineté de l'île d'Elbe, que lui
avaient offerte les souverains alliés. Ainsi que l'indique le billet
ci-inclus, cette lettre parvint à l'empereur par l'intermédiaire du
prince de Talleyrand, dans les papiers duquel elle a été retrouvée.

     «J'ai l'honneur d'adresser à Votre Altesse deux lettres au lieu
     d'une que je lui avais promise.

     »J'ai pensé qu'il convenait de faire connaître à _Monsieur_ la
     lettre que j'écris à Bonaparte.

     »J'ai ajouté quelques réflexions qui m'ont paru nécessaires
     dans cette circonstance. Votre Altesse sait que ceux dont je ne
     partage pas les inquiétudes me soupçonnent d'avoir fait
     quelques transactions pusillanimes.

     »Je me rendrai chez Votre Altesse à cinq heures et demie, et
     j'aurai l'honneur de dîner avec elle; elle peut compter que je
     saisirai toutes les occasions de la voir et de profiter de ses
     entretiens.

     »_Signé_: le duc D'OTRANTE.

     »Le 23 avril 1814.»

     »_P.-S._--Je prie Votre Altesse de se charger de faire passer
     la lettre à Bonaparte, quand elle l'aura communiquée à
     _Monsieur_.»

       *       *       *       *       *

     «SIRE,

     »Lorsque la France et une partie de l'Europe étaient à vos
     pieds, j'ai osé pour vous servir, au risque de vous déplaire,
     vous faire entendre constamment la vérité. Aujourd'hui que vous
     êtes dans le malheur, je crains bien davantage de vous blesser
     en vous parlant un langage sincère, mais je vous le dois
     puisqu'il vous est utile et même nécessaire.

     »Vous avez accepté pour retraite l'île d'Elbe et sa
     souveraineté. Je prête une oreille attentive à tout ce qu'on
     dit de cette souveraineté et de cette île. Je crois devoir vous
     assurer que la situation de cette île dans l'Europe ne convient
     pas à la vôtre, et que le titre de souverain de quelques
     arpents de terre convient moins encore à celui qui a possédé un
     immense empire.

     »Je vous prie de peser ces deux considérations et vous sentirez
     combien l'une et l'autre sont fondées.

     »L'île d'Elbe est assez voisine de l'Afrique, de la Grèce, de
     l'Espagne; elle touche presque aux côtes de l'Italie et de la
     France; de cette île, la mer, les vents et une felouque peuvent
     transporter rapidement dans tous les pays les plus exposés à
     des mouvements, à des événements et à des révolutions.
     Aujourd'hui, il n'y a encore nulle part de stabilité. Dans
     cette mobilité actuelle des nations, un génie tel que le vôtre
     donnera toujours des inquiétudes et des soupçons aux
     puissances.

     »Vous serez accusé sans être coupable, mais sans être coupable
     vous ferez du mal: car des alarmes sont un grand mal pour les
     gouvernements et pour les peuples.

     »Le roi qui va régner sur la France ne voudra régner que par la
     justice, mais vous savez combien les haines sont habiles à
     donner à une calomnie les couleurs d'une vérité!

     »Les titres que vous conservez, en rappelant à chaque instant
     ce que vous avez perdu, ne peuvent servir qu'à rendre vos
     regrets plus amers: ils ne paraîtront pas un reste, mais une
     représentation bien vaine de tant de grandeurs évanouies; je
     dis plus: sans vous honorer, ils vous exposeront davantage. On
     dira que vous ne gardez ces titres que parce que vous gardez
     toutes vos prétentions. On dira que le rocher d'Elbe est le
     point d'appui sur lequel vous placerez les leviers avec
     lesquels vous chercherez à soulever le monde.

     »Permettez-moi de vous dire ma pensée tout entière, elle est le
     résultat de mûres réflexions: il serait plus glorieux et plus
     consolant pour vous de vivre en simple citoyen; et aujourd'hui
     l'asile le plus sûr et le plus convenable, pour un homme tel
     que vous, ce sont les États-Unis d'Amérique.

     »Là, vous recommencerez votre existence au milieu de ces
     peuples assez neufs encore; ils sauront admirer votre génie
     sans le craindre. Vous y serez sous la protection de ces lois
     égales et inviolables pour tout ce qui respire, dans la patrie
     des Franklin, des Washington et des Jepherson; vous prouverez à
     ces peuples que si vous aviez reçu la naissance au milieu
     d'eux, vous auriez senti, pensé et voté comme eux, que vous
     auriez préféré leurs vertus et leurs libertés à toutes les
     dominations de la terre.

     »J'ai l'honneur d'être avec respect, de Votre Majesté, le très
     humble serviteur.

     »_Signé_: le duc D'OTRANTE.

     »Paris, le 23 avril 1814.»

     »_P.-S._--Je dois déclarer à Votre Majesté que je n'ai pris
     conseil de personne en vous écrivant cette lettre, et que je
     n'ai reçu aucune instruction.»

A cet endroit est placée dans le manuscrit une longue note écrite
probablement par M. de Bacourt d'après un chapitre de l'ouvrage de
Capefigue: l'_Histoire des traités de 1815_. L'auteur établit que
l'empereur Napoléon avait fini par accepter l'ultimatum des alliés au
congrès de Châtillon, et que les conditions obtenues, le 30 mai, par
M. de Talleyrand après la chute de l'empire étaient beaucoup
meilleures.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Le 17 février 1814, le congrès de Châtillon arrêta la formule du
    traité proposé à l'empereur Napoléon, et M. de Metternich
    l'envoya à M. de Caulaincourt.

    La voici:

    «Au nom de la très sainte et indivisible Trinité,

    »Leurs Majestés impériales d'Autriche et de Russie, Sa Majesté
    le roi du royaume uni de la Grande-Bretagne et de l'Irlande, et
    Sa Majesté le roi de Prusse agissant au nom de tous leurs
    alliés, d'une part, et Sa Majesté l'empereur des Français, de
    l'autre; désirant cimenter le repos et le bien futur de l'Europe
    par une paix solide et durable, sur terre et sur mer; et ayant,
    pour atteindre à ce but salutaire, leurs plénipotentiaires
    actuellement réunis à Châtillon-sur-Seine, pour discuter les
    conditions de cette paix, lesdits plénipotentiaires sont
    convenus des articles suivants:

    »ARTICLE PREMIER.--Il y aura paix et amnistie entre Leurs
    Majestés impériales d'Autriche et de Russie, Sa Majesté le roi
    du royaume uni de la Grande-Bretagne et de l'Irlande, et sa
    Majesté le roi de Prusse, agissant en même temps au nom de tous
    leurs alliés, et Sa Majesté l'empereur des Français, leurs
    héritiers et successeurs à perpétuité.

    »Les hautes parties contractantes s'engagent à apporter tous
    leurs soins à maintenir, pour le bonheur futur de l'Europe, la
    bonne harmonie, si heureusement rétablie entre elles.

    »ARTICLE II.--Sa Majesté l'empereur des Français, renonce pour
    lui et ses successeurs, à la totalité des acquisitions, réunions
    ou incorporations faites par la France depuis le commencement de
    la guerre de 1792.

    »Sa Majesté renonce également à toute l'influence
    constitutionnelle, directe ou indirecte, hors des anciennes
    limites de la France, telles qu'elles se trouvaient établies
    avant la guerre de 1792, et aux titres qui en dérivent, et
    nommément, à ceux de roi d'Italie, roi de Rome, protecteur de la
    confédération du Rhin, et médiateur de la confédération suisse.

    »ARTICLE III.--Les hautes parties contractantes reconnaissent
    formellement et solennellement le principe de la souveraineté et
    indépendance de tous les États de l'Europe, tels qu'ils seront
    constitués à la paix définitive.

    »ARTICLE IV.--Sa Majesté l'empereur des Français reconnaît
    formellement la reconstitution suivante des pays limitrophes de
    la France:

    »1º L'Allemagne composée d'États indépendants, unis par un lien
    fédératif;

    »2º L'Italie divisée en États indépendants placés entre les
    possessions autrichiennes et la France;

    »3º La Hollande, sous la souveraineté de la maison d'Orange,
    avec un accroissement de territoire;

    »4º La Suisse, État libre, indépendant, replacée dans ses
    anciennes limites, sous la garantie de toutes les grandes
    puissances, la France y comprise;

    »5º L'Espagne, sous la domination de Ferdinand VII, dans ses
    anciennes limites.

    »Sa Majesté l'empereur des Français reconnaît, de plus, le droit
    des puissances alliées de déterminer, d'après les traités
    existant entre les puissances, les limites et rapports tant des
    pays cédés par la France que de leurs États entre eux, sans que
    la France puisse aucunement y intervenir.

    »ARTICLE V.--Par contre Sa Majesté britannique consent à
    restituer à la France, à l'exception des îles nommées les
    Saintes, toutes les conquêtes qui ont été faites par elle sur la
    France pendant la guerre, et qui se trouvent à présent au
    pouvoir de Sa Majesté britannique dans les Indes occidentales,
    en Afrique et en Amérique.

    »L'île de Tabago, conformément à l'article II du présent traité,
    restera à la Grande-Bretagne, et les alliés promettent
    d'employer leurs bons offices pour engager Leurs Majestés
    suédoise et portugaise à ne point mettre d'obstacle à la
    restitution de la Guadeloupe et de Cayenne à la France.

    »Tous les établissements et toutes les factoreries conquis sur
    la France à l'est du cap de Bonne-Espérance, à l'exception des
    îles de Saint-Maurice (île de France), de Bourbon et de leurs
    dépendances, lui seront restitués. La France ne rentrera dans
    ceux des susdits établissements et factoreries qui sont situés
    dans le continent des Indes et dans les limites des possessions
    britanniques que sous la condition qu'elle les possédera
    uniquement à titre d'établissements commerciaux, et elle promet,
    en conséquence, de n'y point faire construire de fortifications
    et de n'y point entretenir de garnisons, ni forces militaires
    quelconques, au delà de ce qui est nécessaire pour maintenir la
    police dans lesdits établissements.

    »Les restitutions ci-dessus mentionnées en Asie, en Afrique et
    en Amérique, ne s'étendront à aucune possession qui n'était
    point effectivement au pouvoir de la France avant le
    commencement de la guerre de 1792.

    »Le gouvernement français s'engage à prohiber l'importation des
    esclaves dans toutes les colonies et possessions restituées par
    le présent traité, et à défendre à ses sujets, de la manière la
    plus efficace, le trafic des nègres en général.

    »L'île de Malte, avec ses dépendances, restera en pleine
    souveraineté à Sa Majesté britannique.

    »ARTICLE VI.--Sa Majesté l'empereur des Français remettra,
    aussitôt après la ratification du présent traité préliminaire,
    les forteresses et forts des pays cédés et ceux qui sont encore
    occupés par ses troupes en Allemagne, sans exception, et
    notamment la place de Mayence, dans six jours; celles de
    Hambourg, Anvers, Berg-op-Zoom, dans l'espace de six jours;
    Mantoue, Palma-Nuova, Venise et Peschiera; les places de l'Oder
    et de l'Elbe, dans quinze jours; et les autres places et forts,
    dans le plus court délai possible, qui ne pourra excéder celui
    de quinze jours. Ces forts et places seront remis dans l'état où
    ils se trouvent présentement avec toute leur artillerie,
    munitions de guerre et de bouche, archives...; les garnisons
    françaises de ces places sortiront avec armes, bagages et avec
    leurs propriétés particulières.

    »Sa Majesté l'empereur des Français fera également remettre dans
    l'espace de quatre jours aux armées alliées les places de
    Besançon, Belfort et Huningue, qui resteront en dépôt jusqu'à la
    ratification de la paix définitive, et qui seront remises dans
    l'état dans lequel elles auront été cédées, à mesure que les

    M. de Caulaincourt, dominé par les ordres de Napoléon, négocia pour
    obtenir de meilleures conditions que celles renfermées dans ce projet
    de traité. Ses hésitations, qu'il ne faut attribuer qu'aux péripéties
    de la lutte que soutenait l'empereur Napoléon, tantôt vainqueur,
    tantôt battu dans ses rencontres avec les armées coalisées,
    provoquèrent de la part du prince de Metternich la lettre suivante
    adressée à M. de Caulaincourt:

    «18 mars 1814.

    »Les affaires tournent bien mal, monsieur le duc. Le jour où on
    sera tout à fait décidé pour la paix, avec les sacrifices
    indispensables, venez pour la faire, mais non pour être
    l'interprète de projets inadmissibles. Les questions sont trop
    fortement placées pour qu'il soit possible de continuer à écrire
    des romans, sans de grands dangers pour l'empereur Napoléon. Que
    risquent les alliés? En dernier résultat, après de grands
    revers, on peut être forcé de quitter le territoire de la
    vieille France. Qu'aura gagné l'empereur Napoléon? Les peuples
    de la Belgique font d'énormes efforts dans le moment actuel. On
    va placer toute la rive gauche du Rhin sous les armes. La Savoie
    ménagée jusqu'à cette heure, pour la laisser à toute
    disposition, va être soulevée, et il y aura des attaques très
    personnelles contre l'empereur Napoléon, qu'on n'est plus maître
    d'arrêter.

    »Vous voyez que je vous parle avec franchise, comme à l'homme de
    la paix. Je serai toujours sur la même ligne. Vous devez
    connaître nos vues, nos principes, nos voeux. Les premières sont
    toutes européennes et par conséquent françaises. Les seconds
    portent à avoir l'Autriche comme intéressée au bien-être de la
    France; les troisièmes sont en faveur d'une dynastie si
    intimement liée à la sienne.

    »Je vous ai voué, mon cher duc, la confiance la plus entière,
    pour mettre un terme aux dangers qui menacent la France; il
    dépend encore de votre maître de faire la paix; le fait ne
    dépendra peut-être plus de lui, sous peu. Le trône de Louis XIV,
    avec les ajoutés de Louis XV, offre d'assez belles chances pour
    ne pas devoir être mis sur une seule carte. Je ferai tout ce que
    je pourrai pour retenir lord Castlereagh quelques jours. Ce
    ministre parti, on ne fera plus la paix.

    »Agréez...

    »Le prince DE METTERNICH.»

       *       *       *       *       *

    Cette lettre est importante; elle montre la position de
    l'Autriche, qui ne peut plus rester seule et qui doit marcher
    avec la coalition; celle-ci marche sur Paris. Alors seulement
    Napoléon se décide à accepter les conditions des alliés. On a
    nié le fait de l'acceptation; on a dit que l'empereur avait
    repoussé le traité humiliant proposé par les alliés. C'est
    inexact; il l'accepta tard, mais il l'accepta.

    Voici la lettre de M. de Caulaincourt, adressée au prince de
    Metternich, et qui fut expédiée de Doulevent _le 25 mars_, par
    M. de Gallebois, officier d'ordonnance du maréchal Berthier:

    «Doulevant, 25 mars 1814.

    «Arrivé cette nuit seulement près de l'empereur, Sa Majesté m'a
    sur-le-champ donné ses derniers ordres pour la conclusion de la
    paix. Elle m'a remis en même temps tous les pouvoirs nécessaires
    pour la négocier et la signer avec les ministres des cours
    alliées, cette voie pouvant réellement mieux que toute autre en
    assurer le prompt rétablissement. Je me hâte donc de vous
    prévenir que je suis prêt à me rendre à votre quartier général,
    et j'attends aux avant-postes la réponse de Votre Excellence.
    Notre empressement prouvera aux souverains alliés combien les
    intentions de l'empereur sont pacifiques, et que, de la part de
    la France, aucun retard ne s'opposera à la conclusion de l'oeuvre
    salutaire qui doit assurer le repos du monde.

    »CAULAINCOURT, duc DE VICENCE.»

       *       *       *       *       *

    Cette lettre est datée du 25 mars, un mois après _l'ultimatum_
    des alliés. Une seconde lettre, également de M. de Caulaincourt
    à M. de Metternich, fut expédiée le même jour; elle acceptait
    tout:

    «Mon prince, je ne fais que d'arriver et je ne perds pas un
    moment pour exécuter les ordres de l'empereur, et pour joindre
    confidentiellement à ma lettre tout ce que je dois à la
    confiance que vous m'avez témoignée.

    »L'empereur me met à même de renouer les négociations, et de la
    manière la plus franche et la plus positive. Je réclame donc les
    facilités que vous m'avez fait espérer, afin que je puisse
    arriver, et le plus tôt possible. Ne laissez pas à d'autres,
    mon prince, le soin de rendre la paix au monde. Il n'y a pas de
    raison pour qu'elle ne soit pas faite dans quatre jours, si
    votre bon esprit y préside, si on la veut aussi franchement que
    nous. Saisissons l'occasion, et bien des fautes et des malheurs
    seront réparés. Votre tâche, mon prince, est glorieuse, la
    mienne sera très pénible; mais puisque le repos et le bonheur de
    tant de peuples en peuvent résulter, je n'y apporterai pas moins
    de zèle et de dévouement que vous.

    »CAULAINCOURT, duc DE VICENCE.»

    Voilà ce qui est positif et constaté par les pièces; Napoléon
    acceptait à la fin de mars la frontière de l'ancienne monarchie
    avec toutes les conditions rigoureuses que lui faisaient les
    alliés; il cédait les forteresses, la flotte d'Anvers (ce que
    l'on reprocha tant depuis à M. de Talleyrand); il donnait en
    dépôt les places de Besançon, de Belfort et d'Huningue, ce que
    ne firent pas les Bourbons en 1814. Telle est la vérité. Nier
    que Napoléon ait définitivement accepté _l'ultimatum_ des alliés
    à Châtillon, c'est récuser toute la correspondance de M. de
    Caulaincourt et ses négociations ultérieures à Paris.

    Ceux qui ont écrit avec beaucoup de simplicité que dans les deux
    restaurations il y eut des déloyautés, des trahisons sans
    nombre, n'ont pas assez remarqué que la première de toutes les
    trahisons, c'est le suicide du pouvoir; quand il s'est frappé
    lui-même, est-il étonnant qu'on le délaisse?

    Les vérités suivantes sont démontrées jusqu'à la plus claire
    évidence:

    1º A Prague (1813), Napoléon pouvait faire la paix en cédant
    l'Illyrie, les villes hanséatiques, avec l'indépendance de
    l'Allemagne et de l'Espagne;

    2º A Francfort, il pouvait aussi faire la paix (décembre 1813)
    en gardant les frontières naturelles du Rhin, des Alpes, des
    Pyrénées;

    3º A Châtillon (mars 1814), dans nos malheurs, il avait accepté
    cette paix aux conditions humbles et soumises des anciennes
    frontières; la cession de presque toutes nos colonies;
    l'occupation par l'ennemi de Besançon, de Belfort et d'Huningue,
    la cession de la flotte d'Anvers et de toutes les munitions de
    guerre des places fortes;

    4º Par les traités des 23 avril et 30 mai 1814, les Bourbons
    firent gagner à la France une plus grande frontière, et au
    congrès de Vienne, M. de Talleyrand sut reconquérir la
    prépondérance de la France sur l'Europe.

FIN DE LA SEPTIÈME PARTIE.




HUITIÈME PARTIE




CONGRÈS DE VIENNE

(1814-1815)




CONGRÈS DE VIENNE (1814-1815)


J'arrivai à Vienne le 23 septembre 1814.

Je descendis à l'hôtel Kaunitz, loué pour la légation française. Le
suisse me remit en entrant quelques lettres dont l'adresse portait: «A
monsieur le prince de Talleyrand, _hôtel Kaunitz_». Le rapprochement
de ces deux noms me parut de bon augure.

Dès le lendemain de mon arrivée, je me rendis chez les membres du
corps diplomatique. Je les trouvai tous dans une sorte d'étonnement du
peu de parti qu'ils avaient tiré de la capitulation de Paris. Ils
venaient de traverser des pays qui avaient été ravagés par la guerre
pendant bien des années, et où ils n'avaient entendu, disaient-ils,
que des paroles de haine et de vengeance contre la France qui les
avait accablés de contributions et souvent traités en vainqueur
insolent. Mes nouveaux collègues m'assuraient qu'on leur avait
partout reproché leur faiblesse en signant le traité de Paris. Aussi
les trouvai-je fort blasés sur les jouissances que donne la
générosité, et plutôt disposés à s'exciter entre eux sur les
prétentions qu'ils avaient à faire valoir. Chacun relisait le traité
de Chaumont qui n'avait pas seulement resserré les noeuds d'une
alliance pour la continuation de la guerre. Ce traité avait aussi posé
les conditions d'une alliance qui devait survivre à la guerre présente
et tenir les alliés éventuellement unis pour un avenir même éloigné.
Et de plus, comment se résoudre à admettre dans le conseil de l'Europe
la puissance contre laquelle l'Europe était armée depuis vingt ans? Le
ministre d'un pays si nouvellement réconcilié, disaient-ils, doit se
trouver bien heureux qu'on lui laisse donner son adhésion aux
résolutions qui seront prises par les ambassadeurs des autres
puissances.

Ainsi, à l'ouverture des négociations, tous les cabinets se
regardaient, malgré la paix, comme étant dans une position, si ce
n'est tout à fait hostile, du moins fort équivoque, avec la France.
Ils pensaient tous, plus ou moins, qu'il aurait été de leur intérêt
qu'elle fût encore affaiblie. Ne pouvant rien à cet égard, ils se
concertaient pour diminuer, au moins, son influence. Sur ces divers
points, je les voyais tous d'accord.

Il me restait à espérer qu'il y aurait entre les puissances quelques
divergences d'opinion, lorsque l'on en viendrait à distribuer les
nombreux territoires que la guerre avait mis à leur disposition,
chacune désirant, soit obtenir pour elle-même, soit faire donner aux
États dépendant d'elle, une partie considérable des territoires
conquis. On aurait bien voulu, en même temps, exclure du partage, ceux
qu'on craignait de trouver trop indépendants. Ce genre de lutte,
cependant, m'offrait bien peu de chance de pénétrer dans les affaires;
car il existait entre les puissances des arrangements faits
précédemment, et par lesquels on avait réglé le sort des territoires
les plus importants. Pour parvenir à modifier ces arrangements, ou à y
faire renoncer tout à fait, selon que la justice en ordonnerait, il y
avait bien plus que des préventions à effacer, bien plus que des
prétentions à combattre, bien plus que des ambitions à réprimer; il
fallait faire annuler ce que l'on avait fait sans la France. Car si
l'on consentait à nous admettre à prendre part aux actes du congrès,
ce n'était que pour la forme, et pour nous ôter les moyens de
contester un jour leur validité; mais on prétendait bien que la France
n'aurait rien à voir dans les résolutions déjà arrêtées, et qu'on
voulait tenir pour des faits consommés.

Avant de donner ici ce qui, dans mon opinion, forme le tableau le plus
fidèle du congrès de Vienne, c'est-à-dire ma correspondance officielle
avec le département des affaires étrangères de France, et ma
correspondance particulière avec le roi Louis XVIII, ainsi que les
lettres de ce souverain pendant la durée du congrès, je crois devoir
jeter un coup d'oeil rapide et général sur la marche des délibérations
de cette grande assemblée. On en saisira mieux ensuite les détails.

L'ouverture du congrès avait été fixée au 1er octobre; j'étais à
Vienne depuis le 23 septembre; mais j'y avais été précédé de quelques
jours par les ministres qui, après avoir dirigé la guerre, se
repentant de la paix, voulaient reprendre leurs avantages au congrès.
Je ne fus pas longtemps sans être informé que déjà ils avaient formé
un comité, et tenaient entre eux des conférences dont il était dressé
un protocole. Leur projet était de décider seuls ce qui aurait dû être
soumis aux délibérations du congrès, et cela sans le concours de la
France, de l'Espagne, ni d'aucune puissance de second ordre, à qui
ensuite ils auraient communiqué comme proposition en apparence, mais
de fait comme résolution, les différents articles qu'ils auraient
arrêtés. Je ne me plaignis point. Je continuai à les voir, sans parler
d'affaires; je me bornai à faire connaître tout le mécontentement que
j'éprouvais aux ministres des puissances secondaires, qui avaient des
intérêts communs avec moi. Retrouvant aussi dans l'ancienne politique
de leurs pays de vieux souvenirs de confiance dans la France, ils me
regardèrent bientôt comme leur appui, et, une fois bien assuré de leur
assentiment pour tout ce que je ferais, je pressai officiellement
l'ouverture du congrès. Dans mes premières demandes je me plaçai comme
n'ayant aucune connaissance des conférences qui avaient eu lieu.
L'ouverture du congrès était fixée pour tel jour; ce jour était passé;
je priai que l'on en indiquât un autre qui fût prochain. Je fis
comprendre qu'il était utile que je ne fusse pas trop longtemps
éloigné de France. Quelques réponses, d'abord évasives, me firent
renouveler mes instances; j'arrivai à me plaindre un peu; et alors je
dus faire usage de l'influence personnelle que j'avais heureusement
acquise dans des négociations précédentes sur les principaux
personnages du congrès. M. le prince de Metternich, M. le comte de
Nesselrode, ne voulaient pas être désobligeants pour moi, et ils me
firent inviter à une conférence qui devait avoir lieu à la
chancellerie des affaires étrangères. M. de Labrador, ministre
d'Espagne, avec qui je m'honore d'avoir fait cause commune dans les
délibérations du congrès, reçut la même invitation.

Je me rendis à la chancellerie d'État à l'heure indiquée; j'y trouvai
lord Castlereagh[154], le prince de Hardenberg[155], M. de Humboldt,
M. de Nesselrode, M. de Labrador, M. de Metternich et M. de
Gentz[156], homme d'un esprit distingué, qui faisait les fonctions de
secrétaire. Le procès-verbal des séances précédentes était sur la
table. Je parle avec détails de cette première séance, parce que c'est
elle qui décida de la position de la France au congrès. M. de
Metternich l'ouvrit par quelques phrases sur le devoir qu'avait le
congrès de donner de la solidité à la paix qui venait d'être rendue à
l'Europe. Le prince de Hardenberg y ajouta que pour que la paix fût
solide, il fallait que les engagements que la guerre avait forcé de
prendre fussent tenus religieusement; que c'était là l'intention des
_puissances alliées_.

  [154] Robert Stewart, marquis de Londonderry, vicomte Castlereagh,
  né en 1769 en Irlande, fut élu à vingt et un ans à la Chambre des
  communes. En 1797, il devint lord du sceau privé d'Irlande, puis
  secrétaire du lord-lieutenant Camden et membre du conseil privé
  d'Irlande. Très attaché à Pitt, il fut nommé ministre de la guerre
  et des colonies en 1805; la mort de Pitt amena la dissolution du
  ministère, mais Castlereagh reprit son portefeuille en 1807. Il se
  retira en 1809. En 1812, il revint au pouvoir comme ministre des
  affaires étrangères, et fut le véritable ministre dirigeant durant
  le ministère de lord Liverpool. Il eut une influence considérable
  sur les événements de 1814 et 1815, et assista aux congrès de
  Châtillon et de Vienne. Il mourut en 1822: on sait qu'il se donna
  la mort.

  [155] Charles-Auguste, prince de Hardenberg, homme d'État prussien,
  né en 1750 en Hanovre. Il fut d'abord au service de l'électeur,
  passa ensuite à celui du duc de Brunswick, et devint quelque temps
  après ministre du margrave de Bayreuth et d'Anspach. Ces
  principautés ayant été réunies à la Prusse en 1791, Hardenberg
  devint ministre du roi de Prusse. En 1795, il signa la paix de Bâle
  avec la France. En 1804, il remplaça le comte d'Haugwitz aux
  affaires étrangères, mais se démit après la bataille d'Austerlitz.
  Il reprit son portefeuille après la bataille d'Iéna, fut de nouveau
  obligé de se retirer à la paix de Tilsitt. En 1810, il fut nommé
  chancelier d'État. Après la campagne de Russie, il poussa
  activement à la guerre contre la France, et fut l'un des
  signataires du traité de Paris. Il assista au congrès de Vienne. En
  1817, il devint président du conseil d'État, et mourut en 1822.

  [156] Frédéric de Gentz, né en 1764, fut d'abord secrétaire-général
  du ministère des finances de Prusse, puis conseiller aulique à
  Vienne. Ardent ennemi de la France, il eut un rôle considérable
  dans la diplomatie européenne. En 1813, il rédigea le manifeste des
  puissances contre la France, assista au congrès de Vienne comme
  secrétaire, rédigea le traité de Paris de 1815, et assista aux
  différents congrès de la sainte alliance. Il mourut en 1832.

Placé à côté de M. de Hardenberg, je dus naturellement parler après
lui; et après avoir dit quelques mots sur le bonheur qu'avait la
France de se trouver dans des rapports de confiance et d'amitié avec
tous les cabinets de l'Europe, je fis remarquer que M. le prince de
Metternich et M. le prince de Hardenberg avaient laissé échapper une
expression qui me paraissait appartenir à d'autres temps; qu'ils
avaient parlé l'un et l'autre des intentions qu'avaient les
_puissances alliées_. Je déclarai que des _puissances alliées_ et un
_congrès_ dans lequel se trouvaient des puissances qui n'étaient pas
_alliées_ étaient, à mes yeux, bien peu propres à faire loyalement des
affaires ensemble. Je répétai avec un peu d'étonnement et même de
chaleur le mot de puissances _alliées_... «_Alliées_..., dis-je, et
contre qui? Ce n'est plus contre Napoléon: il est à l'île d'Elbe...;
ce n'est plus contre la France: la paix est faite...; ce n'est
sûrement pas contre le roi de France: il est garant de la durée de
cette paix. Messieurs, parlons franchement, s'il y a encore des
_puissances alliées_, je suis de trop ici».--Je m'aperçus que je
faisais quelque impression et particulièrement sur M. de Gentz. Je
continuai: «Et cependant, si je n'étais pas ici, je vous manquerais
essentiellement. Messieurs, je suis peut-être le seul qui ne demande
rien. De grands égards, c'est là tout ce que je veux pour la France.
Elle est assez puissante par ses ressources, par son étendue, par le
nombre et l'esprit de ses habitants, par la contiguité de ses
provinces, par l'unité de son administration, par les défenses dont la
nature et l'art ont garanti ses frontières. Je ne veux rien, je vous
le répète; et je vous apporte immensément. La présence d'un ministre
de Louis XVIII consacre ici le principe sur lequel repose tout l'ordre
social. Le premier besoin de l'Europe est de bannir à jamais l'opinion
qu'on peut acquérir des droits par la seule conquête, et de faire
revivre le principe sacré de la légitimité d'où découlent l'ordre et
la stabilité. Montrer aujourd'hui que la France gêne vos délibérations
ce serait dire que les vrais principes seuls ne vous conduisent plus
et que vous ne voulez pas être justes; mais cette idée est bien loin
de moi, car nous sentons tous également qu'une marche simple et droite
est seule digne de la noble mission que nous avons à remplir. Aux
termes du traité de Paris: _Toutes les puissances qui ont été engagées
de part et de d'autre, dans la présente guerre, enverront des
plénipotentiaires à Vienne pour régler dans un congrès général, les
arrangements qui doivent compléter les dispositions du traité de
Paris._ Quand s'ouvre le congrès général? Quand commencent les
conférences? Ce sont là les questions que font tous ceux que leurs
intérêts amènent ici. Si, comme déjà on le répand, quelques puissances
privilégiées voulaient exercer sur le congrès un pouvoir dictatorial,
je dois dire que, me renfermant dans les termes du traité de Paris, je
ne pourrais consentir à reconnaître dans cette réunion, aucun pouvoir
suprême dans les questions qui sont de la compétence du congrès, et
que je ne m'occuperais d'aucune proposition qui viendrait de sa part.»

Après quelques moments de silence, M. de Labrador fit avec son langage
fier et piquant, une déclaration à peu près semblable à la mienne:
l'embarras était sur tous les visages. On niait et on expliquait à la
fois, ce qui s'était fait avant cette séance. Je profitai de ce moment
pour faire quelques concessions aux amours-propres que je voyais en
souffrance. Je dis que dans une réunion aussi nombreuse que l'était le
congrès, où l'on avait à s'occuper de tant de matières diverses, à
statuer sur des questions du premier ordre et à décider d'une foule
d'intérêts secondaires, il était bien difficile, il était même
impossible d'arriver à un résultat, en traitant tous ces objets dans
des assemblées générales, mais que l'on pouvait trouver quelque moyen
pour distribuer et classer toutes les affaires, sans blesser ni les
intérêts ni la dignité d'aucune des puissances.

Ce langage, quoique vague encore, laissant entrevoir pour les affaires
générales, la possibilité d'une direction particulière, permit aux
ministres réunis de revenir sur ce qu'ils avaient fait, de le regarder
comme non avenu; et M. de Gentz détruisit les protocoles des séances
précédentes et dressa celui de ce jour-là. Ce protocole devint le
procès-verbal de la première séance, et pour prendre date, je le
signai. Depuis ce temps, il n'y eut plus entre les grandes puissances,
de conférences sans que la France en fît partie. Nous nous réunîmes
les jours suivants pour établir la distribution du travail. Tous les
membres du congrès se partagèrent en commissions qui étaient chargées
d'examiner les questions qu'on leur soumettait. Dans chacune de ces
commissions entrèrent les plénipotentiaires des États qui avaient un
intérêt plus direct aux objets qu'elles avaient à examiner. On
attribua les matières les plus importantes et les questions d'un
intérêt général à la commission formée des représentants des huit
principales puissances de l'Europe; et pour prendre une base, il fut
dit que ce serait celles qui avaient signé le traité du 30 mai 1814.
Cet arrangement était non seulement utile, parce qu'il abrégeait et
facilitait singulièrement le travail, mais il était aussi très juste,
puisque tous les membres du congrès y consentirent, et qu'il ne
s'éleva aucune réclamation.

Ainsi, à la fin du mois d'octobre 1814, je pus écrire à Paris, que la
maison de Bourbon, rentrée depuis cinq mois en France, que la France
conquise cinq mois auparavant, se trouvaient déjà replacées à leur
rang en Europe, et avaient repris l'influence qui leur appartenait sur
les plus importantes délibérations du congrès. Et trois mois plus
tard, ces mêmes puissances qui n'avaient rien fait pour sauver
l'infortuné Louis XVI, étaient appelées par moi, à rendre un tardif
mais solennel hommage à sa mémoire. Cet hommage était encore une
manière de relier la chaîne des temps, une nouvelle consécration des
légitimes droits de la maison de Bourbon. Je dois dire que l'empereur
et l'impératrice d'Autriche me secondèrent puissamment pour la pieuse
et noble cérémonie célébrée à Vienne, le 21 janvier 1815, à laquelle
assistèrent tous les souverains et tous les personnages alors présents
dans la capitale de l'empire d'Autriche.

Le premier objet dont s'occupa la commission des huit puissances fut
le sort du roi et du royaume de Saxe et ensuite on du royaume de
Saxe. En l'acquérant, elle aurait non seulement accru ses possessions
d'un riche et beau pays; mais encore elle aurait largement fortifié
son ancien territoire. Dans le cours de la guerre qu'avait terminée la
paix de Paris, les alliés de la Prusse lui avaient promis que, par les
arrangements à intervenir, la possession de la Saxe lui serait
assurée. La Prusse, en conséquence, comptait, avec une entière
certitude, sur cette importante acquisition et se regardait déjà comme
souveraine de ce bel État, qu'elle occupait par ses troupes, tandis
qu'elle retenait le roi de Saxe comme prisonnier dans une forteresse
prussienne. Mais, lorsqu'on fit la proposition de le lui donner dans
la commission des huit puissances, je déclarai qu'il m'était
impossible d'y souscrire. Je convins que la Prusse dépouillée par
Napoléon, de vastes et nombreuses possessions qu'elle ne pouvait
toutes recouvrer, avait droit à être indemnisée. Mais, était-ce une
raison pour que la Prusse, à son tour, vînt dépouiller le roi de Saxe?
N'était-ce pas vouloir substituer à un droit fondé en justice, le
droit du plus fort, dont la Prusse avait été si près de devenir la
victime? Et, en usant de ce droit, renoncer par le fait à l'intérêt
que sa position devait inspirer? Les territoires dont le congrès avait
à disposer n'offraient-ils pas d'ailleurs d'autres moyens de lui
assigner d'amples indemnités? La France voulait bien se montrer facile
dans tous les arrangements qui pouvaient convenir au roi de Prusse,
pourvu qu'ils ne fussent pas contre le droit; et je répétai qu'elle ne
pouvait ni participer ni consentir à ceux qui constitueraient une
usurpation. Et sans parler de l'intérêt qui s'attachait à la personne
du roi de Saxe, respectable par ses malheurs et par les vertus qui
avaient honoré son règne, j'invoquai seulement en sa faveur le
principe sacré de la légitimité.

La Prusse trouvait que l'on aurait assez satisfait à tout ce qu'exige
ce principe, en assignant au roi de Saxe quelques indemnités dans les
pays disponibles, et que, soit que ce prince consentît ou ne consentît
pas à cet arrangement, la possession de la Saxe serait, pour elle,
suffisamment légitimée par la reconnaissance des souverains alliés.
Sur quoi je fis observer au prince de Hardenberg qu'une reconnaissance
de ce genre, faite par ceux qui n'ont aucun droit à une chose, ne
pouvait conférer un droit à celui qui n'en a pas.

Il faut attribuer ce déplorable oubli de tous les principes à
l'agitation déréglée que l'Europe éprouvait depuis vingt-cinq ans;
tant de souverains avaient été dépouillés, tant de pays avaient changé
de maître, que le droit public, atteint par une sorte de corruption,
commençait pour ainsi dire à ne plus réprouver l'usurpation. Les
souverains de l'Europe avaient été successivement forcés, par l'empire
de circonstances irrésistibles, à reconnaître des usurpateurs, à
traiter, à s'allier avec eux. Ils avaient été ainsi peu à peu amenés à
faire céder leur délicatesse à leur sûreté; et pour satisfaire leur
ambition, lorsqu'à leur tour ils en trouvaient l'occasion, ils étaient
disposés à devenir usurpateurs eux-mêmes. Le respect pour les droits
légitimes était en eux tellement affaibli, qu'après leur première
victoire sur Napoléon, ce ne furent pas les souverains qui songèrent
aux droits de la maison de Bourbon; ils eurent même plusieurs autres
projets sur la France. Et si celle-ci recouvra ses rois, c'est que,
dès qu'elle put exprimer son voeu, elle se jeta d'elle-même dans les
bras de cette famille auguste, qui lui apportait de sages libertés
avec ses glorieux souvenirs historiques. Au premier moment, la
restauration avait été pour les puissances, qui, je le répète, y ont
assisté, mais de qui elle n'est point l'ouvrage, une chose de fait,
bien plus qu'une chose de droit.

Lorsque les ministres de France se constituèrent ouvertement au
congrès les défenseurs du principe de la légitimité, on ne se montra
d'abord disposé à en admettre les conséquences, qu'autant qu'elles ne
contrarieraient en rien les convenances respectives devant lesquelles
on prétendait faire fléchir le principe. Aussi, pour le faire
triompher, eus-je à surmonter tous les obstacles que peut susciter
l'ambition contrariée, lorsqu'elle se voit au moment d'être
satisfaite.

Tandis que la Prusse soutenait avec ardeur et ténacité ses prétentions
sur la Saxe, la Russie, soit par l'attachement que son souverain
portait au roi de Prusse, soit parce que le prix de cette concession
devait être pour l'empereur Alexandre, la possession du duché de
Varsovie, les favorisait de tout son pouvoir. Ses ministres parlaient
dans ce sens, sans le moindre embarras. «Tout est arrangement dans les
affaires politiques, me disait l'un d'eux, Naples est votre premier
intérêt; cédez sur la Saxe, et la Russie vous soutiendra pour
Naples.--Vous me parlez là d'un marché, lui répondis-je, et je ne peux
pas en faire. J'ai le bonheur de ne pas être si à mon aise que vous:
c'est votre volonté, votre intérêt qui vous déterminent, et moi, je
suis obligé de suivre des principes; et les principes ne transigent
pas.»

Le principal objet de l'Angleterre, en concourant aux vues de la
Prusse et de la Russie sur la Saxe, paraissait être de fortifier, par
une seconde ligne de défense établie sur l'Elbe, celle que la Prusse
avait déjà sur l'Oder, afin que cette puissance pût opposer une
barrière plus solide aux entreprises que, par la suite, la Russie
pourrait former contre l'Allemagne. Mais cette idée, même
stratégiquement, était une pure illusion.

L'Autriche n'avait guère d'autre motif déterminant d'appuyer les
prétentions de la Prusse, que celui de maintenir des arrangements qui,
dans le tumulte des camps, avaient été précédemment projetés avec
précipitation et légèreté. Elle n'avait pas même été arrêtée alors par
le danger pour elle de laisser la Prusse s'établir sur les flancs des
montagnes de la Bohême, danger qu'elle sembla ne voir que lorsque la
France l'en eût averti. Je trouvai un moyen direct de faire,
comprendre à l'empereur François, sans passer par son ministère, qu'il
avait un intérêt grave à ce que la Saxe fût conservée. Les raisons que
je développai à l'intermédiaire[157] que j'employai firent impression
sur son esprit.

  [157] Cet intermédiaire était le comte de Sickingen, d'une famille
  noble d'Allemagne, qui descendait du fameux capitaine Franz de
  Sickingen (1481-1523).

L'Angleterre comprit bientôt aussi qu'il serait imprudent de jeter un
nouvel élément d'inimitié et de discorde entre les deux puissances qui
défendaient contre la Russie les abords de l'Allemagne. D'ailleurs la
Saxe aurait été longtemps pour la Prusse une possession peu soumise et
précaire, toujours prête à saisir les occasions de lui échapper et de
recouvrer son indépendance. Ce serait donc pour la Prusse une
acquisition plus propre à l'affaiblir qu'à la fortifier. La question
du sort de la Saxe étant ainsi dégagée pour l'Angleterre des
considérations particulières qui avaient motivé sa première
détermination, et étant ramenée pour l'Autriche au véritable point de
vue sous lequel son intérêt devait la lui faire considérer, la France
trouva enfin ces deux puissances disposées à écouter sans prévention
les fortes raisons qu'elle avait pour faire prévaloir les principes.
Lorsque ces deux puissances virent que leurs propres convenances se
trouvaient d'accord avec le principe de la légitimité, elles
reconnurent volontiers que ce principe l'emportait sur les convenances
des autres. Elles furent conduites à en devenir par là aussi les
défenseurs, et les choses arrivèrent bientôt au point qu'une alliance
secrète et éventuelle se forma entre la France, l'Autriche et
l'Angleterre, contre la Russie et la Prusse[158]. Ainsi la France, par
le seul ascendant de la raison, par la puissance des principes, venait
de rompre une alliance qui n'était dirigée que contre elle. (Heureuse
si la funeste catastrophe du 20 mars n'en fut venu renouer les
liens!!)

  [158] 3 janvier 1815. Par ce traité la France, l'Autriche et
  l'Angleterre promettaient de faire cause commune pour réprimer
  l'ambition de la Prusse et de la Russie, et s'assuraient
  mutuellement du concours d'une armée de cent cinquante mille
  hommes.

Les alliés se trouvaient ainsi divisés entre eux, tandis que nous
venions d'établir une alliance nouvelle dans laquelle la France était
partie principale. La première alliance, celle contre Napoléon, que
l'on aurait voulu faire survivre à l'objet pour lequel elle avait été
contractée, ne pouvait apporter aux alliés que les moyens de
satisfaire des ambitions et des vues particulières, tandis que le but
de l'alliance nouvelle ne pouvait être que le maintien des principes
d'ordre, de conservation et de paix. Par là, la France, cessant à
peine d'être l'effroi de l'Europe, en devenait en quelque sorte,
l'arbitre et la modératrice.

L'Angleterre et l'Autriche étant une fois décidées, la Prusse devait
nécessairement céder; aussi finit-elle par consentir à ce que la Saxe
continuât d'exister, et elle se contenta d'en recevoir une partie, à
titre de cession volontaire faite par le souverain de ce pays. Ce
grand point obtenu, il fallut ensuite amener le roi de Saxe à faire ce
sacrifice. On me chargea, ainsi que le duc de Wellington et le prince
de Metternich, de nous rendre auprès de lui pour tâcher de l'y
décider. La nouvelle de l'arrivée de Napoléon en France venait de se
répandre à Vienne. Il y avait dans le congrès une agitation extrême.
On ne nous donna que vingt-quatre heures pour remplir notre pénible
mission. Je me rendis immédiatement à Presbourg, où l'on avait fini
par permettre au roi de Saxe de venir habiter.

Madame la comtesse de Brionne[159] habitait cette ville, où elle
s'était retirée à la suite de son émigration... Madame de Brionne!!...
Madame de Brionne qui avait eu pour moi pendant tant d'années toute
l'affection que l'on porte à l'un de ses enfants et qui me croyait des
torts envers elle... Oh! il faut que la politique attende! En arrivant
à Presbourg, je courus me jeter à ses pieds. Elle m'y laissa assez de
temps pour que j'eusse le bonheur de recevoir ses larmes sur mon
visage. «Vous voilà donc enfin! me dit-elle. J'ai toujours cru que je
vous reverrais. J'ai pu être mécontente de vous, mais je n'ai pas
cessé un moment de vous aimer. Mon intérêt vous a suivi partout...»
Je ne pouvais dire un mot, je pleurais. Sa bonté cherchait à me
remettre un peu en me faisant des questions. «Votre position est
belle, me dit-elle.--Oh! oui, je la trouve bien belle.» Les larmes
m'étouffaient. L'impression que je ressentis était si vive que je dus
la quitter pendant quelques instants; je me sentais défaillir, j'allai
prendre l'air sur les bords du Danube. Revenu un peu à moi, je
retournai chez madame de Brionne. Elle reprit ses questions, je pus
mieux y répondre. Elle me parla un peu du roi, beaucoup de _Monsieur_.
Elle me nomma le roi de Saxe, elle savait que j'avais défendu sa
cause, elle s'y intéressait. Quelques jours après cette entrevue, la
mort m'enleva cette amie que j'avais été si heureux de retrouver.

  [159] Louise-Julie-Constance de Rohan, mariée à Charles-Louis de
  Lorraine, comte de Brionne (voir t. Ier p. 43, 92 et notes).

Je me rendis dans la soirée au palais, et m'acquittai de la commission
dont j'avais été chargé. Le roi de Saxe, qui voulait bien avoir
quelque confiance en moi, m'avait fait demander de le voir seul. Dans
cette conférence où sans aucun embarras, il me parlait de sa
reconnaissance, je lui montrai la nécessité de faire quelques
sacrifices, je tâchai de le convaincre que, au point où en étaient les
choses, c'était le seul moyen de garantir l'indépendance de son pays.
Le roi me garda près de deux heures; il ne prit encore aucun
engagement et me dit seulement qu'il allait se retirer dans son
intérieur avec sa famille. Quelques heures après, nous reçûmes, le
prince de Metternich, le duc de Wellington et moi, l'invitation de
nous rendre au palais. Le prince de Metternich que nous avions choisi
pour être notre organe, fit connaître au roi, avec beaucoup de
ménagement, le voeu des puissances. Le roi, avec une expression fort
noble et fort touchante, nous parla de son affection pour ses peuples,
et cependant nous laissa entrevoir qu'il ne mettrait point d'obstacle
à ce qui, d'accord avec l'honneur de sa couronne, pourrait contribuer
aux arrangements de l'Europe, se réservant d'envoyer au congrès un
ministre revêtu de ses pleins pouvoirs pour y traiter de ses intérêts.

Nous repartîmes pour Vienne sans être porteurs de l'adhésion du roi,
mais persuadés néanmoins qu'il était décidé, et que c'était par M.
d'Einsiedel, son plénipotentiaire, que son consentement parviendrait
au congrès.

Après quelques conférences où l'on admit M. d'Einsiedel, les intérêts
de la Saxe et de la Prusse se réglèrent, non pas à la satisfaction de
l'une et de l'autre, mais d'accord entre elles[160]. Ainsi le principe
de la légitimité n'eut point à souffrir dans cette importante
circonstance.

  [160] La Prusse acquit toute la haute et la basse Lusace, presque
  toute la Misnic et la Thuringe, avec les places de Torgau et de
  Wittemberg (traité du 18 mai 1815).

Il résulta de ces arrangements que la Russie, qui avait prétendu à la
possession entière du duché de Varsovie, dut se désister. La Prusse en
recouvra une portion considérable, et l'Autriche, qui n'avait pas
cessé de posséder une partie de la Gallicie, reprit quelques-uns des
districts qu'elle avait cédés en 1809. Cette disposition qui, au
premier coup d'oeil, peut paraître n'avoir eu d'importance que pour ces
deux puissances, était d'un intérêt général. La Pologne, presque
entière entre les mains de la Russie, devait être un objet
d'inquiétude continuelle pour l'Europe. Il importait à la sûreté de
celle-ci que deux puissances plutôt qu'une seule, exposées à se voir
enlever ce qu'elles possédaient, fussent, par le sentiment du danger
commun, disposées à s'unir en toute occasion contre les entreprises
ambitieuses de la Prusse. Un même intérêt devenait pour elles le lien
le plus fort, et c'est par cette raison que la France soutint ici les
prétentions de la Prusse et de l'Autriche.

Le ministre de Russie chercha à me combattre par mes propres
arguments. Il prétendit que si le principe de la légitimité exigeait
la conservation du royaume de Saxe, il devait exiger aussi le
rétablissement du royaume de Pologne; il ajouta que l'empereur
Alexandre voulait avoir la totalité du duché de Varsovie pour l'ériger
en royaume, et qu'ainsi je ne pouvais sans inconséquence refuser de
souscrire à ce qu'on le remît entre ses mains. Je répondis avec
vivacité que l'on pourrait bien à la vérité regarder comme une
question de principe le rétablissement en corps de nation, et sous un
gouvernement indépendant, d'un peuple nombreux, autrefois puissant,
occupant un territoire vaste et contigu, et qui, s'il avait laissé
rompre les liens de son unité, était cependant resté homogène par une
communauté de moeurs, de langue et d'espérances; que si on le voulait,
la France serait la première, non seulement à donner son adhésion au
rétablissement de la Pologne, mais encore à le réclamer avec ardeur, à
la condition que la Pologne serait rétablie telle qu'elle était
autrefois, telle que l'Europe voudrait qu'elle fût. Mais, ajoutai-je,
il n'y a rien de commun entre le principe de la légitimité et la plus
ou moins grande extension qui serait donnée à l'État que prétend
former la Russie avec une petite portion de la Pologne, et sans même
montrer le projet d'y réunir, plus tard, les belles provinces qui,
depuis les derniers partages, ont été annexées à ce vaste empire. Les
ministres de Russie, après plusieurs conférences, comprirent qu'ils ne
réussiraient pas à couvrir du principe de la légitimité, les vues
intéressées qu'ils étaient chargés de faire valoir, et ils se
bornèrent à négocier pour obtenir une plus ou moins grande partie du
territoire qui, pendant quelques années, avait composé le grand-duché
de Varsovie.

En rendant hommage au principe de la légitimité, par la décision prise
à l'égard du royaume de Saxe, on avait implicitement prononcé sur le
sort du royaume de Naples. Le principe une fois adopté, on ne pouvait
se refuser à en admettre les conséquences. Aussi la France, après
avoir repoussé les prétentions fondées sur le droit de conquête,
réclama-t-elle l'assurance que Ferdinand IV serait reconnu roi de
Naples. Il fallut surmonter l'embarras réel de quelques cabinets qui
s'étaient liés avec Murat, et surtout de l'Autriche qui avait fait un
traité avec lui. J'étais bien loin de me refuser à adopter tout ce
qui, conduisant au même but, pouvait se concilier avec la dignité des
puissances. Murat vint à mon aide. Il était dans une agitation
continuelle; il écrivait lettres sur lettres, faisant des
déclarations, ordonnait à ses troupes des marches, des contre-marches,
et me fournissait mille occasions de montrer sa mauvaise foi. Un
mouvement qu'il fit faire à son armée du côté de la Lombardie fut
regardé comme une agression, et cette agression devint le signal de sa
ruine[161]. Les Autrichiens marchèrent contre lui, le battirent, le
poursuivirent, et en peu de jours, abandonné par son armée, il sortit
en fugitif du royaume de Naples, qui retourna aussitôt sous le sceptre
de son roi légitime. La restitution du royaume de Naples à Ferdinand
IV consacrait de nouveau, par un grand exemple, le principe de la
légitimité, et de plus, elle était utile à la France, parce qu'elle
lui donnait en Italie, pour allié, le plus puissant État de cette
contrée [162].

  [161] On était d'accord à Vienne pour renverser Murat, mais on ne
  trouvait pas de prétexte, lorsque lui-même vint le fournir. Il
  avait à Vienne un agent, le duc de Campo-Chiaro, qu'on avait refusé
  d'admettre au congrès. Bien qu'il n'eût ainsi aucune position
  officielle, Murat lui envoya vers la fin de février 1815 une note,
  avec ordre de la communiquer aux puissances, dans laquelle le roi
  demandait des explications aux souverains, sur leurs intentions à
  son égard, déclarant que, le cas échéant, il était prêt à se
  battre, et prévenant qu'il serait alors forcé de passer sur le
  territoire de plusieurs des États italiens nouvellement créés.
  L'Autriche saisit cette occasion, et, sous le prétexte de protéger
  les princes autrichiens d'Italie, fit marcher cent cinquante mille
  hommes contre Murat.

  [162] Si je ne devais pas à ma famille de rapporter ici le décret
  honorable qu'a rendu pour moi le roi Ferdinand IV, en m'accordant
  le duché de Dino, la reconnaissance seule m'en ferait un devoir.
  (_Note du prince de Talleyrand._)

  Le roi et la reine des Deux-Siciles s'étaient remis à M. de Talleyrand
  du soin de défendre leurs intérêts au congrès. Voici à ce sujet les
  lettres qu'ils lui avaient écrites. Nous les transcrivons
  littéralement d'après les originaux qui existent dans les papiers du
  prince.


  _Lettre du roi des Deux-Siciles._

  «Monsieur le prince,

  »Ma main peu sûre m'oblige à en emprunter une étrangère, mais fidelle,
  pour vous exprimer mes sentiments: ayant été informé par mon éprouvé
  et dévoué ministre, le commandeur Ruffo, de vos dispositions
  favorables à mes intérêts, et de celui que vous prenez à me faire
  restituer mon royaume de Naples, je ne veux pas différer à vous en
  témoigner ma reconnaissance et à remettre ma juste cause dans les
  mains d'un ministre dont les talents sublimes dans le maniement des
  affaires peuvent seuls me promettre un succès heureux; et il serait
  doux pour moi de le devoir à un Périgord. Je charge le commandeur
  Ruffo de vous confirmer en mon nom toutes les expressions des
  sentiments que doit m'inspirer la confiance de l'intérêt pour ma cause
  que vous développerez dans le congrès; et c'est dans ces sentiments
  que je désire que vous en receviez, par anticipation, l'expression de
  la reconnaissance de votre très affectionné,

  »FERDINAND.

  »Palerme, ce 1er octobre 1814.»


  _Lettre de la reine des Deux-Siciles._

  «Prince de Bénévent,

  »Les droits que vous venez d'acquérir à la reconnaissance de tous les
  individus apartenant à la maison de Bourbon m'engagent à profiter du
  moyen de mon anciene et constante amie, la baronne de Tailerand, votre
  parente, pour vous faire parvenir les assurances de la haute estime et
  considération, que m'ont inspirées les signalés services que vous
  venez de rendre dans ces derniers et heureux événements à cette
  famille à laquelle j'appartiens par tous les liens possibles, et à la
  restauration et grandeur de laquelle vous venez de contribuer avec
  autant de gloire que de zèle; j'unis les sentiments de ma
  reconnaissance à ceux qu'éprouvent le roi mon époux et toute ma
  famille, et je jouis d'en être l'interprète. Les événements étonans et
  rapides, qui viennent de rendre à la branche aînée des Bourbons et à
  celle d'Espagne le rang et les trônes de leurs ancêtres, n'ont pas
  encore eu d'influence sur celle des Deux-Siciles, malgré que les
  malheurs, et surtout la constance, lui aient acquis des droits sacrés
  à l'estime, à l'équité de ses alliés; mais l'influence que la France
  va reprendre à juste titre en Europe nous est un sûr garant que, par
  son intérêt pour nous, elle soutiendra nos droits légitimes, avec
  cette noblesse et fermeté qui distinguent la nation, son souverain et
  le ministre qu'il a eu la sagesse et le talent de distinguer et de
  choisir. C'est dans eux que je pose aujourd'hui ma confiance et
  l'espoir du bonheur futur et de la gloire de ma famille; les malheurs
  de l'entière famille des Bourbons, la cruelle expérience, tout nous a
  prouvé que nos différentes branches doivent être unies à jamais entre
  elles pour leur prospérité et leur gloire et celle des peuples
  qu'elles sont appelées à gouverner, et que c'est au chef de la famille
  qu'elle doivent se rattacher. Ce sont les sentiments du roi mon époux,
  ce sont ceux de toute ma famille; et ils seront sans nul doute la base
  de la conduite à venir de notre gouvernement dans nos liaisons
  politiques. Acceptez de nouveau, prince, le tribut d'admiration et de
  reconnaissance que je rends, avec une véritable satisfaction, à vos
  talents et à vos services, en mon nom et en celui de toute ma famille.

  »Votre affectionnée,

  »CHARLOTTE.

  »Vienne, le 27 juin 1814.

Les arrangements convenus à l'égard de plusieurs autres parties de
l'Italie eurent pour objet d'établir dans cette péninsule de forts
contre-poids capables d'arrêter la puissance autrichienne, si ses vues
ambitieuses se portaient un jour de ce côté. Ainsi le royaume de
Sardaigne acquit tout l'État de Gênes. La branche de la maison de
Savoie, régnante alors à Turin, étant près de s'éteindre, et
l'Autriche pouvant par suite de ses alliances de famille, élever des
prétentions à cette belle succession, l'effet en fut prévenu par la
reconnaissance des droits de la maison de Carignan, à qui on assura
l'hérédité de cette couronne.

La Suisse, point central en Europe, sur lequel viennent s'appuyer
trois grandes contrées, la France, l'Allemagne et l'Italie, fut
solennellement et à perpétuité déclarée neutre. Par cette résolution,
on augmenta pour chacun de ces trois pays les moyens de défense, et on
diminua les moyens d'agression. Cette disposition est surtout
favorable à la France qui, entourée de places fortes sur toutes les
autres parties de ses frontières, en est dépourvue sur celle qui a la
Suisse pour confins. La neutralité de ce pays lui donne donc, sur le
seul point où elle soit faible et désarmée, un boulevard inexpugnable.

Pour préserver le corps helvétique des dissensions intérieures qui, en
troublant son repos, auraient pu compromettre le maintien de sa
neutralité, nous nous attachâmes à concilier les prétentions
respectives des cantons, et à arranger les différends qui existaient
depuis longtemps entre eux. L'union menacée par le conflit des
intérêts anciens et des intérêts nés de l'organisation nouvelle, faite
sous la médiation de Napoléon, se trouva affermie par un acte où l'on
réunit toutes les dispositions qui paraissaient le mieux pouvoir les
accorder.

L'érection du nouveau royaume des Pays-Bas, convenue antérieurement à
la paix, était évidemment une mesure hostile contre la France; et ce
projet avait été conçu dans la vue de créer auprès d'elle un État
ennemi, que le besoin de protection rendait l'allié naturel de
l'Angleterre et de la Prusse. Le résultat de cette combinaison,
cependant, me parut moins dangereux pour la France qu'on ne le
pensait, car le nouveau royaume aura longtemps assez à faire pour se
consolider[163]. En effet, formé de deux pays divisés par d'anciennes
inimitiés, opposés de sentiments et d'intérêts, il doit rester faible
et sans consistance pendant beaucoup d'années. L'espèce d'intimité
protectrice que l'Angleterre croit établir entre elle et ce nouvel
État me semble devoir être pour longtemps encore un rêve politique. Un
royaume composé d'un pays de commerce et d'un pays de fabriques doit
devenir un rival de l'Angleterre ou être annulé par elle, et par
conséquent mécontent.

  [163] Il n'en eut pas le temps. On sait que la révolution de
  1830-1832 sépara la Belgique de la Hollande.

L'organisation de la confédération germanique devait être un des
éléments les plus importants de l'équilibre de l'Europe. Je ne puis
dire si le congrès eût réussi à fonder cette organisation sur des
bases qui l'eussent fait efficacement servir d'appui à cet équilibre.
Les funestes événements de 1815, qui vinrent forcer le congrès à
précipiter ses délibérations, firent que l'on ne put déposer dans
l'acte final qu'un germe informe qui, jusqu'à présent, n'a pu prendre
de consistance et que l'on travaille encore à développer.

Je laisse à apprécier le rôle qu'a joué la France dans cette mémorable
circonstance. Malgré le désavantage de la position où elle se trouvait
à l'ouverture des conférences, elle parvint à prendre dans les
délibérations un tel ascendant, que les questions les plus
importantes se décidèrent en partie selon ses vues, et d'après les
principes qu'elle avait établis et soutenus, tout opposés qu'ils
fussent aux intentions des puissances à qui le sort des armes avait
donné le pouvoir de dicter sans obstacle leurs lois à l'Europe. Et,
quoique au milieu des discussions du congrès, l'esprit de révolte et
d'usurpation soit venu subjuguer encore la France, le roi, rendu à
Gand, exerçait à Vienne la même influence que du château des
Tuileries. A ma demande, et je dois le dire pour l'honneur des
souverains, sans instances, l'Europe lança une déclaration foudroyante
contre _l'usurpateur_[164]. Je l'appelle ainsi parce que c'est là ce
que fut Napoléon à son retour de l'île d'Elbe. Jusque-là, il avait été
conquérant; ses frères seuls avaient été usurpateurs.

  [164] Le 25 mars 1815, à la nouvelle de l'arrivée de Napoléon à
  Paris, l'Angleterre, l'Autriche, la Russie et la Prusse renouèrent
  leur alliance. Tous les autres États de l'Europe accédèrent à ce
  traité. En même temps les puissances lançaient la déclaration
  suivante:

    En rompant ainsi la convention qui l'avait établi à l'île d'Elbe,
    Buonaparte détruit le seul titre légal auquel son existence se
    trouvait attachée. En reparaissant en France avec des projets de
    trouble et de bouleversements, il s'est privé lui-même de la
    protection des lois, et a manifesté à la face de l'univers qu'il ne
    saurait y avoir ni paix ni trêve avec lui... Les puissances
    déclarent en conséquence que Napoléon Buonaparte s'est placé hors
    des relations civiles et sociales, et que, comme ennemi et
    perturbateur du repos du monde, il s'est livré à la vindicte
    publique.

Je retrouvai à cette époque la récompense de ma fidélité aux
principes. Au nom du roi, je les avais invoqués pour la conservation
des droits des autres, et ils étaient devenus la garantie des siens.
Toutes les puissances, se voyant de nouveau menacées par la révolution
renaissante en France, armèrent en toute hâte. On précipita la fin des
négociations de Vienne pour se livrer sans relâche à des soins
devenus plus pressants; et l'acte final du congrès, quoique encore
ébauché seulement dans quelques parties, fut signé par les
plénipotentiaires qui se séparèrent ensuite.

Les affaires étant ainsi terminées, le roi, et par conséquent la
France, ayant été reçu dans l'alliance contre Napoléon et ses
adhérents, je quittai Vienne où rien ne me retenait plus, et je me mis
en route pour Gand, fort éloigné d'imaginer qu'en arrivant à
Bruxelles, j'apprendrais l'issue de la bataille de Waterloo. C'est M.
le prince de Condé qui eut la bonté de m'en donner tous les détails.
Il me parla, avec une grâce que je n'oublierai jamais, des succès
qu'avait eus la France au congrès de Vienne.

Après cet exposé succinct des délibérations du congrès de Vienne, on
pourra lire avec plus d'intérêt, peut-être, les correspondances
suivantes.

Toutes ces correspondances sont déposées aux archives du département
des affaires étrangères, c'est-à-dire les minutes des lettres du roi
Louis XVIII de sa main propre, et les originaux de mes lettres; les
copies que je donne ici sont prises sur les originaux du roi et sur
mes minutes[165].

  [165] La correspondance qui va suivre a déjà été publiée il y a
  quelques années par M. Pallain (_Correspondance inédite de Louis
  XVIII et de M. de Talleyrand_, 1 vol. in-8º), à l'exception
  cependant des lettres des ambassadeurs du roi au ministre des
  affaires étrangères qui sont insérées ici.--Nous avons relevé,
  entre le texte officiel trouvé par M. Pallain dans les archives du
  ministère des affaires étrangères, et le texte que M. de Talleyrand
  a voulu conserver dans ses _Mémoires_, certaines différences
  souvent insignifiantes, parfois au contraire assez curieuses, et
  qu'il nous a en tout cas paru intéressant de signaler. On trouvera
  en note et en italiques les additions et les variantes. En outre,
  il y a dans notre texte plusieurs passages qui ne sont pas
  reproduits dans le texte des archives; nous les avons également
  soulignés et indiqués.


Nº 1[166].--LE PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND AU ROI LOUIS XVIII[167].

    me suis arrêté qu'à Strasbourg et à Munich._

    »La princesse de Galles venait de quitter Strasbourg. Elle avait
    accepté un bal chez madame Franck, veuve du banquier de ce nom;
    elle y avait dansé toute la nuit. _Dans l'auberge dans laquelle je
    suis descendu elle avait donné à souper à Talma. Sa manière d'être
    à Strasbourg explique parfaitement pourquoi M. le prince régent
    aime mieux la savoir en Italie qu'en Angleterre._--A Munich le roi
    m'a parlé de son attachement pour Votre Majesté, des craintes que
    lui donnait l'ambition prussienne; il m'a dit _de fort bonne
    grâce:_ «J'ai servi vingt _et un_ ans la France, cela ne s'oublie
    point.» _Deux heures de conversation que j'ai pu avoir avec M. de
    Montgelas m'ont bien prouvé_ qu'il ne fallait que suivre les
    principes arrêtés par Votre Majesté, comme base du système
    politique de la France, pour nous assurer le retour et nous
    concilier la confiance des puissances d'un _ordre_ inférieur.

    _»A Vienne le langage de la raison et de la modération ne se trouve

    »Un des ministres de Russie _nous disait hier_: «On a voulu faire
    de nous une puissance asiatique; _la Pologne nous fera européens_.»

    »La Prusse, de son côté, ne demande pas mieux que d'échanger ses
    anciennes provinces polonaises contre celles qu'elle convoite en
    Allemagne et sur les bords du Rhin. On doit regarder ces deux
    puissances comme intimement _liées_ sur ce point.

    »Les ministres russes insistent, sans avoir admis jusqu'ici la
    moindre discussion, sur une extension territoriale qui porterait
    cette puissance sur les bords de la Vistule, en réunissant même la
    vieille Prusse à leur empire.

    »_J'espère que l'empereur, qui dans différentes circonstances m'a
    permis_ de lui exposer avec franchise _ce que je jugeais_ le plus
    utile _à ses intérêts et à sa gloire, me permettra de combattre
    devant lui le système de ses ministres. Le philanthrope La Harpe se
    révolte contre l'ancien partage de la Pologne et plaide son
    asservissement à la Russie; il est à Vienne depuis dix ou douze
    jours._

    »On conteste encore au roi de Saxe le droit d'avoir un ministre au
    congrès. _M. de Schulembourg, que je connais depuis longtemps, m'a
    dit hier que le roi avait déclaré_ qu'il ne ferait aucun acte de
    cession, d'abdication ni d'échange qui pourrait détruire
    l'existence de la Saxe _et nuire aux droits de sa maison_; cette
    honorable résistance pourra faire quelque impression sur ceux qui
    partagent encore l'idée de la réunion de ce royaume à la Prusse.

    »La Bavière a fait offrir au roi de Saxe d'appuyer ses prétentions,
    s'il le fallait, par _un corps de troupes considérable. M. de Wrède
    dit qu'il a ordre de donner jusqu'à quarante mille hommes._

    _»La question de Naples n'est pas résolue. L'Autriche veut placer
    Naples et la Saxe sur la même ligne et la Russie veut en faire des
    objets de compensation_.

    M. de Metternich _plus_ à son aise.

    »Rien n'est déterminé à l'égard de la _conduite et de la marche des
    affaires au congrès. Les Anglais mêmes, que je croyais plus
    méthodiques que les autres, n'ont fait aucun, travail préparatoire
    sur cet objet._

    _«Je suis porté à croire que l'on se réunira à l'idée d'avoir deux
    commissions: l'une composée des six grandes puissances, et devant
    s'occuper des affaires générales de l'Europe; l'autre devant
    préparer les affaires d'Allemagne et devant être de même composée
    des six premières puissances allemandes; j'aurais désiré qu'il y en
    eût sept. L'idée d'une commission pour l'Italie déplait
    prodigieusement à l'Autriche._

    »La marche que Votre Majesté a tracée à ses ministres est si noble,
    _qu'elle doit nécessairement, si toute raison n'a pas disparu de
    dessus la terre, finir par leur donner quelque influence_.

    très humble et très obéissant serviteur et sujet.

    _«P.-S.--L'empereur de Russie et le roi de Prusse viennent
    d'arriver. Leur entrée a été fort belle. Ils étaient à cheval;
    l'empereur d'Autriche au milieu. Un petit désordre occasionné par
    les chevaux a fait que pendant une partie considérable du chemin,
    le roi de Prusse était à la droite de l'empereur François. Les
    choses ne sont rentrées dans l'ordre que peu de temps avant
    d'arriver au palais.»_

Vienne, le 25 septembre 1814.

SIRE,

J'ai quitté Paris le 16. Je suis arrivé ici le 24 au matin. La
princesse de Galles venait de quitter Strasbourg _lorsque j'y suis
arrivé_. Elle avait accepté un bal chez madame Franck, veuve du
banquier de ce nom, où elle a dansé toute la nuit. Elle avait, la
veille de son départ, donné à souper à Talma. Ce qui m'en a été dit
m'explique les motifs qui font préférer au prince régent de la savoir
plutôt sur le continent qu'en Angleterre. Elle se disposait à partir
pour l'Italie.

A Munich, le roi[168] m'a parlé de son attachement pour Votre Majesté.
Il m'a dit: «J'ai servi vingt ans la France. Cela ne s'oublie point.
_Si Monsieur ou M. le duc de Berry étaient venus à Strasbourg, lorsque
j'étais à Bade, j'aurais été bien empressé d'aller leur faire ma
cour[169].»_

  [168] Maximilien 1er, roi de Bavière. Il avait été colonel au
  service de la France avant la révolution de 1789. Il était connu
  alors sous le nom de prince Max de Deux-Ponts.

  [169] Supprimé dans le texte des archives.

J'ai entrevu qu'il ne fallait que suivre les principes arrêtés par
Votre Majesté comme base du système politique de la France, pour nous
assurer le retour et nous concilier la confiance des puissances d'un
rang inférieur.

_Depuis mon arrivée ici, je n'ai pu recevoir que quelques personnes.
M. de Dalberg, qui m'avait précédé d'un jour, avait, de son côté,
recueilli quelques notions[170]._

  [170] Supprimé dans le texte des archives.

Je vois, Sire, que le langage de la raison et celui qui caractérise
la modération ne seront point dans la bouche de tous les
plénipotentiaires.

Un des ministres de Russie a dit il y a peu de jours: «On a voulu
faire de nous une puissance asiatique. Nous allons être Européens par
la Pologne.»

La Prusse, de son côté, ne demande pas mieux que d'échanger ses
anciennes provinces polonaises contre celles qu'elle convoite en
Allemagne et sur les bords du Rhin. On doit regarder ces deux
puissances comme intimement unies sur ce point.

Les ministres russes insistent, sans avoir admis jusqu'ici la moindre
discussion, sur une extension territoriale qui porterait cette
puissance sur les bords de la Vistule, en réunissant même la vieille
Prusse à son empire. _Ils annoncent, cependant, que cette question
restait à traiter avec leur souverain, qui, seul, pouvait changer
leurs instructions[171]._

J'espère qu'à l'arrivée de l'empereur de Russie, qui, en différentes
circonstances, m'a accordé le droit de lui exposer avec franchise ce
que je jugerais le plus utile à ses véritables intérêts et à sa
gloire, je pourrai lui faire connaître combien il serait avantageux à
son système de philanthropie générale, s'il voulait placer la
modération à côté de la puissance. Peut-être même trouverai-je, sous
ce rapport, le seul point de contact avec M. de la Harpe[172] qui
déjà est ici. L'empereur de Russie et le roi de Prusse sont attendus
aujourd'hui.

  [172] M. de La Harpe, homme d'État suisse, ancien précepteur de
  l'empereur Alexandre, qu'on a déjà vu jouer un rôle imposant dans
  les affaires de son pays au temps du directoire.

On conteste encore au roi de Saxe le droit de tenir un ministre au
congrès. Il a envoyé ici le comte de Schulenburg[173], agent habile et
qui m'est connu. Nous pourrons en tirer parti. Le roi a déclaré qu'il
ne ferait aucun acte de cession, ni d'abdication, ni d'échange, qui
détruisît l'existence de la Saxe. Cette honorable résistance pourra
faire rentrer en eux-mêmes ceux qui protègent encore l'idée de la
réunion de ce royaume à la Prusse.

  [173] Frédéric-Albert, comte de Schulenburg, né à Dresde en 1772.
  Il fut nommé ministre de Saxe à Vienne en 1798, puis à Ratisbonne;
  assista au congrès de Rastadt (1799), et fut peu après envoyé à
  Copenhague, puis à Pétersbourg (1804). Il revint à Vienne en 1810,
  et assista comme plénipotentiaire saxon au congrès de 1814. Il se
  retira en 1830 et se consacra jusqu'à sa mort (1853) exclusivement
  aux lettres.

La Bavière a fait offrir au roi de Saxe d'appuyer ses prétentions,
s'il le fallait, par cinquante mille hommes.

On ne paraît pas d'accord sur la non admission d'un plénipotentiaire
de Naples. Je regarde cette question comme n'étant pas entièrement
résolue.

L'Autriche veut placer Naples et la Saxe sur la même ligne, et la
Russie, en faire des objets de compensation.

La reine de Naples n'est regrettée par personne, et sa mort paraît
avoir mis M. le prince de Metternich à son aise.

Rien au reste n'est encore déterminé à l'égard de la marche et de la
conduite des affaires au congrès, et même, dans le raisonnement des
ministres anglais, j'ai cru entrevoir qu'eux-mêmes n'ont point mûri ce
travail préparatoire.

On propose deux commissions, dont l'une se composerait des grandes
puissances; l'autre, des puissances inférieures. On est disposé à
faire traiter les affaires d'Allemagne par une commission
particulière. Le rôle que Votre Majesté prescrit à ses ambassadeurs
est si noble et si conforme à sa dignité, qu'ils pourront aider à tout
ce qui doit ramener l'ordre en Europe et rétablir un équilibre réel et
durable.

_Je prie Votre Majesté de croire que nous porterons tous nos efforts à
répondre à sa confiance et à suivre la ligne que nous ont tracée les
instructions que Votre Majesté a données à ses ambassadeurs au
congrès[174]._

Vienne, le 27 septembre 1814.

Monsieur le comte,

La correspondance des ministres du roi au congrès n'a encore que peu
de chose à apprendre au département. Les ministres du roi se tiennent
sur la ligne qui leur a été tracée par leurs instructions. Ils
reviennent dans toutes leurs conversations à l'article du traité du 30
mai, qui donne au congrès l'honorable mission d'établir un équilibre
réel et durable. Cette forme désintéressée les conduit à entrer dans
les principes du droit public, reconnu par toute l'Europe et d'où
découle d'une manière presque forcée le rétablissement du roi
Ferdinand IV au trône de Naples, ainsi que la succession, dans la
branche de Carignan, de la maison de Savoie.

La non abdication et la non cession du roi de Saxe donnent aux
ministres du roi le devoir de défendre sa cause.

Vous voyez, monsieur le comte, que nous nous tenons dans des
généralités. Cependant, nous devons vous dire que leur application
paraît être prévue par les ministres, qu'avant la paix, nous appelions
alliés, et que cela place les ministres du roi dans la position qui
convient au beau rôle qu'il est appelé à jouer dans cette grande
circonstance.

Nos informations nous autorisent à vous dire que le malheur et
l'ambition ne laissent pas encore tenir aux ministres prussiens le
langage qu'une réunion aussi pacifique que celle de Vienne semblerait
devoir leur prescrire.

Nous avons l'honneur...

Nº 2.--LE PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND AU ROI LOUIS XVIII.

Vienne, le 29 septembre 1814.

SIRE,

Nous avons enfin presque achevé le cours de nos visites à tous les
membres de la nombreuse famille impériale. Il a été bien doux pour
moi de trouver partout des témoignages de la haute considération dont
on est rempli pour la personne de Votre Majesté, de l'intérêt qu'on
lui porte, des voeux qu'on fait pour elle, tout cela exprimé avec plus
ou moins de bonheur, mais toujours avec une sincérité qu'on ne pouvait
pas soupçonner d'être feinte. L'impératrice, qui depuis notre arrivée
avait dû s'occuper exclusivement de l'impératrice de Russie, nous
avait fait assigner une heure pour aujourd'hui. Elle s'est trouvée
indisposée et, quoiqu'elle ait fait recevoir pour elle plusieurs
personnes par Madame l'archiduchesse, sa mère, elle a voulu recevoir
elle-même l'ambassade de Votre Majesté. Elle m'a questionné, avec un
intérêt qui n'était pas de simple politesse, sur votre santé. «Je me
souviens, m'a-t-elle dit, d'avoir vu le roi à Milan. J'étais alors
bien jeune. Il avait tout plein de bontés pour moi. Je ne l'ai oublié
dans aucune circonstance.» Elle a parlé dans des termes analogues de
Madame la duchesse d'Angoulême, de ses vertus, de l'amour qu'on lui
portait à Vienne et des souvenirs qu'elle y a laissés. Elle a aussi
daigné dire des choses obligeantes pour le ministre de Votre Majesté.
Deux fois, elle a placé dans la conversation le nom de l'archiduchesse
Marie-Louise, la seconde fois avec une sorte d'affectation. Elle
l'appelle _ma fille Louise_. Malgré la toux qui la forçait presque
continuellement[177] à s'interrompre, et malgré sa maigreur, cette
princesse a un don de plaire et des grâces que j'appellerais toutes
françaises, si, pour un oeil très difficile, il ne s'y mêlait peut-être
un tant soi peu d'apprêt.

  [177] Variante: _souvent_.

M. de Metternich est fort poli pour moi. M. de Stadion me montre plus
de confiance. Il est vrai que celui-ci, mécontent de ce que fait
l'autre, s'est retranché dans les affaires des finances, dont on lui a
donné la direction et auxquelles je doute fort qu'il s'entende, et a
laissé les affaires du cabinet, ce qui le rend peut-être plus
communicatif.

J'ai toujours à me louer de la franchise de lord Castlereagh. Il eut,
il y a quelques jours, avec l'empereur Alexandre une conversation
d'une heure et demie, dont il vint aussitôt après me faire part. Il
prétend que dans cette conversation, l'empereur Alexandre a déployé
toutes les ressources de l'esprit le plus subtil; mais que lui, lord
Castlereagh, a parlé dans des termes très positifs et même assez durs
pour être inconvenants, s'il n'y eût pas mêlé, pour leur servir de
passeport, des protestations de zèle pour la gloire de l'empereur.
Malgré tout cela, je crains que lord Castlereagh n'ait pas l'esprit de
décision qu'il nous serait si nécessaire qu'il eût, et que l'idée du
parlement, qui ne l'abandonne jamais, ne le rende timide. Je ferai
tout ce qui sera en moi pour lui inspirer de la fermeté.

Le comte de Nesselrode m'avait dit que l'empereur Alexandre désirait
de me voir, et m'avait engagé à lui écrire pour avoir une
audience[178]. Je l'ai fait, il y a déjà plusieurs jours, et n'ai pas
encore sa réponse. Nos principes, dont nous ne faisons pas mystère,
sont-ils connus de l'empereur Alexandre et lui ont-ils donné vis-à-vis
de moi une sorte d'embarras? S'il me fait, comme je dois le croire
d'après tout ce qui me revient, l'honneur de m'entretenir sur les
affaires de Pologne et de Saxe, je serai doux, conciliant, mais
positif, ne parlant que principes et ne m'en écartant jamais.

  [178] Variante: audience _particulière_.

Je m'imagine[179] que la Russie et la Prusse ne font tant de bruit et
ne parlent avec tant de hauteur que pour savoir ce que l'on pense, et
que, si elles se voient seules de leur parti, elles y regarderont à
deux fois avant de pousser les choses à l'extrémité[180]. Cet
enthousiasme polonais dont l'empereur Alexandre s'était enflammé à
Paris, s'est refroidi à Saint-Pétersbourg. Il s'est ranimé à
Pulawy[181]; il peut s'éteindre de nouveau, quoique nous ayons ici M.
de la Harpe, et qu'on y attende les Czartoryski[182]; j'ai peine à
croire qu'une déclaration simple, mais unanime, des grandes
puissances, ne suffise pas pour le calmer. Malheureusement, celui qui
est en Autriche à la tête des affaires, et qui a la prétention de
régler celles de l'Europe, regarde comme la marque la plus certaine de
la supériorité du génie une légèreté qu'il porte d'un côté jusqu'au
ridicule, et de l'autre, jusqu'à ce point où, dans le ministre d'un
grand État, et dans des circonstances telles que celles-ci, elle
devient une calamité.

  [179] Variante: _Je me persuade_.

  [180] Variante: _à l'extrême_.

  [181] Château des princes Czartoryski en Pologne. Cette résidence
  magnifique a été chantée par le poète Delille dans son poème des
  _Jardins_. (_Note de M. de Bacourt._)

  [182] Les Czartoryski étaient une des plus puissantes familles de
  Pologne. Elle était alors représentée par le prince Adam-Casimir
  (1731-1823), staroste général de Podolie et feld-zeugmeister des
  armées autrichiennes, et par ses deux fils: Adam-Georges, né en
  1770, ancien ambassadeur de Russie et plus tard sénateur du royaume
  de Pologne; et Constantin-Adam, né en 1773, qui était alors colonel
  d'infanterie dans l'armée russe.

Dans cette situation des choses, où tant de passions fermentent, et où
tant de gens s'agitent en tout sens, l'impétuosité et l'indolence sont
deux écueils qu'il me paraît également nécessaire d'éviter. Je tâche
donc de me renfermer dans une dignité calme qui, seule, me semble
convenir aux ministres de Votre Majesté, qui, grâce aux sages
instructions qu'elle leur a données, n'ont que des principes à
défendre, sans aucun plan d'intérêt personnel à faire prévaloir.

Quelle que doive être l'issue du congrès, il y a deux opinions qu'il
faut établir et conserver, celle de la justice de Votre Majesté, et
celle de la force de son gouvernement; car ce sont les meilleurs ou
plutôt les seuls garants de la considération au dehors et de la
stabilité au dedans. Ces deux opinions une fois établies, comme
j'espère qu'elles le seront, que le résultat du congrès soit ou non
conforme à nos désirs et au bien de l'Europe, nous en sortirons
toujours avec honneur.

Nº 2 _bis_.--LES AMBASSADEURS DU ROI AU CONGRÈS, AU MINISTRE DES
AFFAIRES ÉTRANGÈRES A PARIS.

Vienne, le 29 septembre 1814.

Monsieur le comte,

Nous avons été occupés ces jours-ci à nous faire présenter à la
famille impériale d'Autriche. Nous avons cru remarquer que l'empereur
et les archiducs ont cherché à être fort obligeants. L'impératrice,
particulièrement, a mis beaucoup de grâce dans la manière dont elle
nous a reçus. On nous a exprimé de l'attachement pour le roi, et on
s'est informé beaucoup de l'état de la santé de Madame la duchesse
d'Angoulême. Les fêtes ont commencé.

Les affaires du congrès n'ont fait que peu de progrès depuis la
dernière lettre que nous avons eu l'honneur de vous écrire. Nous
continuons à nous tenir attachés aux instructions qui nous ont été
données.

En énonçant les principes qu'elles renferment, la France et le roi
influeront sur les affaires de l'Europe d'une manière aussi noble que
convenable.

Il paraît que, jusqu'ici, tout ce qui devait être convenu à l'égard de
la marche des affaires n'a point été décidé.

Les ministres du roi n'ont pas encore cru devoir intervenir, et nous
attendons, monsieur le comte, qu'on se soit concerté sur ces
différents objets, pour vous en faire connaître les résultats.

Nous avons été instruits de la manière la plus positive que la Russie
n'abandonne aucune de ses prétentions sur la Pologne. Elle déclare que
tout le duché de Varsovie est occupé par ses armées, et qu'il faudra
les en chasser. Tels sont les termes dont on se sert.

La Prusse lui a cédé ce qu'elle appelle ses droits sur ce pays, et
cherche ses dédommagements dans le royaume de Saxe. Cet état de choses
laisse une grande incertitude sur l'issue du congrès.

Les informations prises sur les sentiments de l'Autriche ne donnent
pas une entière confiance que cette puissance voudra employer
convenablement ses nombreuses armées pour le soutien des principes
sans lesquels rien n'est stable.

Les ministres du roi croient avoir observé que le langage ferme et
énergique qu'ils ont tenu en diverses circonstances a produit quelque
effet; qu'il a même amené quelque hésitation sur des plans déjà
presque arrêtés.

Le prince de Talleyrand a demandé à voir l'empereur de Russie en
particulier. Sa lettre depuis trois jours est restée sans réponse. Ce
ne sera qu'après cette entrevue que l'on pourra juger du degré de
modération que ce souverain apportera dans les affaires générales de
l'Europe. Ses ministres ne paraissent point entièrement instruits. Ils
nous évitent, parce qu'ils craignent d'entrer en discussion avec nous.

Les ministres autrichiens témoignent une sorte de défiance.

Les Prussiens servent les Russes. Il ne paraît pas que les ministres
anglais aient un langage bien décidé.

Les agents des petites cours cherchent à se rapprocher de la France,
et nous les y engageons.

Nous ne présentons encore que des aperçus; mais ils peuvent donner une
idée de l'état des choses.

Nº 1 _ter_.--LE ROI LOUIS XVIII AU PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND.

Paris, le 3 octobre 1814[183].

Mon cousin,

J'ai reçu votre dépêche du 25 septembre, et par égard pour vos yeux,
et pour ma main, j'en emprunte une pour y répondre[184] qui n'est pas
la mienne, mais qui est loin d'être étrangère à mes affaires[185].

  [183] Cette lettre est datée du 13 octobre dans le texte des
  archives.

  [184] Variante: pour _vous_ répondre.

  [185] Les lettres du roi Louis XVIII au prince de Talleyrand
  étaient copiées par le comte, depuis duc de Blacas d'Aulps, mais
  signées par le roi. Nous avons déjà dit que les minutes du roi sont
  au dépôt des affaires étrangères, où on ignore même comment elles y
  sont parvenues. (_Note de M. de Bacourt._)

Les rois de Naples et de Saxe sont mes parents au même degré; la
justice réclame également en faveur de tous les deux; mais je ne
saurais y prendre un intérêt pareil[186]. Le royaume de Naples possédé
par un descendant de Louis XIV, ajoute à la puissance de la France.
Demeurant à un individu de la famille de Corse[187], _flagitio addit
damnum_. Je ne suis guère moins révolté de l'idée que ce royaume et la
Saxe puissent servir de compensations. Je n'ai pas besoin de vous
tracer ici mes réflexions sur un pareil oubli de toute morale
publique; mais ce que je dois me hâter de vous dire, c'est que si je
ne puis empêcher cette iniquité, je veux du moins ne pas la
sanctionner, et, au contraire, me réserver, ou à mes successeurs, la
liberté de la redresser, si l'occasion s'en présente.

  [186] Variante: un intérêt _égal_.

  [187] Variante: _du_ Corse.

Je ne dis au reste ceci que pour pousser l'hypothèse jusqu'à
l'extrême, car je suis loin de désespérer du succès de la cause, si
l'Angleterre s'attache fortement aux principes que lord Castlereagh
nous a manifestés ici, et si l'Autriche est dans les mêmes résolutions
que la Bavière.

Ce que M. de Schulenburg vous a dit de la détermination du roi de Saxe
est parfaitement vrai: ce malheureux prince me l'a mandé lui-même.

Vous pouvez facilement juger de l'empressement[188] avec lequel
j'attends des nouvelles du congrès dont les opérations doivent être
actuellement commencées. Sur quoi je prie Dieu, mon cousin, qu'il vous
ait en sa sainte et digne garde.

LOUIS.

Nº 3 _bis_.--LES AMBASSADEURS DU ROI AU CONGRÈS AU MINISTRE DES
AFFAIRES ÉTRANGÈRES.

Vienne, le 4 octobre 1814.

Monsieur le comte,

Depuis notre dernière lettre, nous avons fait un pas de plus. Il ne
nous conduit cependant point encore à voir commencer le travail du
congrès. Nous vous exposons succinctement les démarches qui ont eu
lieu.

M. le prince de Metternich, par un billet en date du 29 septembre,
adressé à M. le prince de Talleyrand, l'a invité à une conférence
particulière. La copie se trouve jointe sous le numéro 1[189].

  [189] Il est souvent fait mention soit dans les lettres de M. de
  Talleyrand soit dans celles des ambassadeurs, de pièces jointes à
  la correspondance et envoyées au département. Ces pièces ne se
  trouvaient point rattachées au manuscrit des _Mémoires_ du prince.
  Elles n'ont pas pu trouver place ici.

Le mot _assister_ et les ministres indiqués faisaient supposer que
cette réunion devait porter le caractère d'une sorte de complaisance
de la part des alliés envers la France. Le prince de Talleyrand y
répondit par le billet ci-joint numéro 2. Vous observerez, monsieur le
comte, qu'en plaçant l'Espagne avant la Prusse, on détruisait
l'intention de M. le prince de Metternich.

Plus tard on sut que M. le prince de Metternich avait fait une
invitation à M. de Labrador, dans laquelle il dit: «Le prince de
Metternich et ses collègues les ministres de Russie, d'Angleterre, et
de Prusse invitent...»

M. de Labrador qui s'attache beaucoup à l'ambassade de France et qui
paraît applaudir à la régularité de sa marche et des principes, a
répondu comme M. le prince de Talleyrand le lui a indiqué.

La conférence a eu lieu chez le prince de Metternich même. Il avait
choisi M. de Gentz, connu pour ses relations anglaises et prussiennes,
comme rédacteur du procès-verbal.

On y fit lecture d'un protocole et d'un projet de déclaration.

Le protocole commençait par nommer les _alliés_ à chaque alinéa, et la
déclaration était faite en leur nom. Elle se trouve jointe sous le
numéro 3.

Le prince de Talleyrand, après avoir relevé deux fois le mot _alliés_,
en déclarant que c'était une insulte au milieu d'un congrès tel
qu'était celui qu'on avait réuni, observa que les conclusions de cette
pièce blessaient les égards dus aux autres puissances; et qu'il
n'appartenait point à _elles seules_ de prendre une initiative qui
n'était fondée sur aucun droit; qu'il valait mieux inviter toutes les
puissances à se réunir en congrès, à faire nommer des commissions, et
procéder ainsi avec la mesure sans laquelle rien n'est légitime; il
déclara enfin qu'il ne pouvait reconnaître aucun arrangement
particulier qui aurait été fait depuis la signature du traité de
Paris.

Le prince de Talleyrand adressa le soir le résultat de ses
observations aux cinq ministres qui s'étaient réunis le matin. Sa note
est sous le numéro 4.

Cette note semble avoir fait retarder la convocation d'une seconde
conférence; et il nous est revenu que les ministres paraissaient en
être embarrassés. Il nous a été dit d'un autre côté qu'ils avaient
l'air de croire qu'on voulait leur faire la leçon, et qu'ils ne
paraissaient pas rendre justice aux soins que l'on prenait de les
ramener aux principes, qui, seuls, peuvent rendre à l'Europe une
assiette solide.

Le prince de Talleyrand s'est décidé à adresser une note officielle,
attendu que ces ministres avaient tenu des conférences préparatoires,
qu'ils avaient signé un procès-verbal et avaient arrêté la publication
de cette pièce, comme étant conforme à l'arrangement qu'ils avaient
pris d'exercer une sorte d'initiative dans les affaires qui restaient
à régler. Voyant qu'il existait quelque chose d'officiel d'un côté, il
crut qu'il fallait qu'il y eût aussi, de l'autre, quelque chose
d'officiel.

Vous jugerez, monsieur le comte, par la lecture de ces différentes
pièces, que les affaires générales ne sont point encore traitées avec
cette franchise et ce sentiment de justice et d'équité qui peuvent les
faire terminer promptement. Vous jugerez également que la position de
l'ambassade de France est fort difficile, parce qu'elle a pour
direction d'engager les autres puissances à être modérées et
raisonnables, et que ces puissances se trouvent encore liées par des
engagements antérieurs et dirigées par une ambition intolérable.
L'opinion que nous énonçons à cet égard est confirmée par une audience
particulière que M. le prince de Talleyrand a eue de Sa Majesté
l'empereur de Russie, et dont il est nécessaire, monsieur le comte, de
vous parler.

L'empereur questionna avec affectation sur l'état de la France, de ses
armées, de ses finances, de l'esprit public; il annonça vouloir
conserver ce qu'il tenait, et posa en principe que, dans les
arrangements qui allaient avoir lieu, il devait y trouver ses
_convenances_. Le prince de Talleyrand observa qu'il fallait plutôt y
chercher _le droit_. L'empereur alors prononça ces mots: «_La guerre
donc!_... vous voulez donc la guerre...?» Le prince de Talleyrand
prit, sans répondre, l'attitude qui indiquait à l'empereur que c'était
lui-même qui la déciderait et qui en porterait la responsabilité.
L'empereur fit entendre qu'il s'était arrangé avec les grandes
puissances, ce que le prince de Talleyrand mit en doute, attendu que
la France n'y avait point concouru, et que toutes s'annonçaient comme
libres d'engagements particuliers, étrangers à ce qui avait été fait à
Paris.

Telle est la situation des affaires. Il nous revient de toute part que
déjà les moyennes et les petites puissances se tournent vers la France
pour y chercher un appui; et nous nous flattons toujours que la nation
russe et l'armée, ne mettant point d'intérêt au rétablissement de la
Pologne et ne voulant pas la guerre pour soutenir des vues d'ambition,
l'empereur de Russie rentrera en lui-même et consentira que l'Europe
recouvre le repos et la tranquillité, en se plaçant sous l'égide des
principes que dicte la raison.

Nous avons l'honneur, monsieur le comte, de vous adresser copie d'une
lettre du ministre de Portugal à lord Castlereagh, par laquelle il
réclame contre l'exclusion qu'on a faite de lui aux premières
conférences, comme ministre portugais. Le prince de Talleyrand a cru
devoir appuyer sa demande.

Agréez....

Nº 3.--LE PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND AU ROI LOUIS XVIII.

Vienne, le 4 octobre 1814.

SIRE,

Le 30 septembre, entre neuf et dix heures du matin, je reçus de M. de
Metternich une lettre de cinq lignes, datée de la veille, et par
laquelle il me proposait, en son nom seul, de venir à deux heures
_assister_ à une conférence préliminaire pour laquelle je trouverais
_réunis_ chez lui les seuls ministres[190] de Russie, d'Angleterre et
de Prusse. Il ajoutait qu'il faisait la même demande, à M. de
Labrador, ministre d'Espagne.

  [190] Variante: _les ministres_.

Les mots _assister_ et _réunis_ étaient visiblement employés avec
dessein. Je répondis que je me rendrais avec grand plaisir chez lui,
avec les ministres de Russie, d'Angleterre, d'Espagne et de Prusse.

L'invitation adressée à M. de Labrador était conçue dans les mêmes
termes que celle que j'avais reçue, avec cette différence qu'elle
était en forme de billet à la troisième personne, et faite au nom de
M. Metternich et _de ses collègues_.

M. de Labrador étant venu me la communiquer et me consulter sur la
réponse à faire, je lui montrai la mienne, et il en fit une toute
pareille, dans laquelle la France était nommée avec et avant les
autres puissances. Nous mêlions ainsi à dessein, M. de Labrador et
moi, ce que les autres paraissaient vouloir séparer, et nous divisions
ce qu'ils avaient l'air de vouloir unir par un lien particulier.

J'étais chez M. de Metternich avant deux heures, et déjà les ministres
des quatre cours étaient réunis en séance, autour d'une table longue:
lord Castlereagh, à une des extrémités et paraissant présider; à
l'autre extrémité, un homme que M. de Metternich me présenta comme
tenant la plume dans leurs conférences; c'était M. de Gentz. Un siège
entre lord Castlereagh et M. de Metternich avait été laissé vacant, je
l'occupai. Je demandai pourquoi j'avais été appelé seul de l'ambassade
de Votre Majesté, ce qui produisit le dialogue suivant: «On n'a voulu
réunir dans les conférences préliminaires que les chefs des
cabinets.--M. de Labrador ne l'est pas, et il est cependant
appelé.--C'est que le secrétaire d'État d'Espagne n'est point à
Vienne.--Mais, outre M. le prince de Hardenberg, je vois ici M. de
Humboldt, qui n'est point secrétaire d'État.--C'est une exception
nécessitée par l'infirmité que vous connaissez au prince de
Hardenberg[191].--S'il ne s'agit que d'infirmités, chacun peut avoir
les siennes, et a le même droit de les faire valoir». On parut alors
disposé à admettre que chaque secrétaire d'État pourrait amener un des
plénipotentiaires qui lui étaient adjoints, et pour le moment je crus
inutile d'insister.

  [191] M. de Hardenberg était affligé d'une surdité presque
  complète.

L'ambassadeur de Portugal, le comte de Palmella[192], informé par lord
Castlereagh qu'il devait y avoir des conférences préliminaires,
auxquelles M. de Labrador et moi devions nous trouver et où il ne
serait point appelé, avait cru devoir réclamer contre une exclusion
qu'il regardait et comme injuste, et comme humiliante pour la couronne
de Portugal. Il avait en conséquence écrit à lord Castlereagh, une
lettre que celui-ci produisit à la conférence. Ses raisons étaient
fortes; elles étaient bien déduites. Il demandait que les huit
puissances qui ont signé le traité du 30 mai, et non pas seulement six
de ces puissances, formassent la commission préparatoire qui devait
mettre en activité le congrès dont elles avaient stipulé la réunion.
Nous appuyâmes cette demande, M. de Labrador et moi. On se montra
disposé à y accéder, mais la décision fut ajournée à la prochaine
séance. La Suède n'a point encore de plénipotentiaire ici, et n'a
conséquemment pas encore été dans le cas de réclamer.

  [192] M. de Souza-Holstein, comte, puis duc de Palmella
  (1786-1850). Il fut plus tard régent du Portugal, en 1830.

«L'objet de la conférence d'aujourd'hui, me dit lord Castlereagh, est
de vous donner connaissance de ce que les quatre cours ont fait depuis
que nous sommes ici.» Et, s'adressant à M. de Metternich: «C'est vous,
lui dit-il, qui avez le protocole.» M. de Metternich me remit alors
une pièce signée de lui, du comte de Nesselrode, de lord Castlereagh
et du prince de Hardenberg. Dans cette pièce, le mot _d'alliés_ se
trouvait à chaque paragraphe. Je relevai ce mot. Je dis qu'il me
mettait dans la nécessité de demander où nous étions, si c'était
encore à Chaumont ou à Laon[193], si la paix n'était pas faite,
s'il y avait guerre et contre qui? Tous me répondirent qu'ils
n'attachaient[194] point au mot _d'alliés_ un sens contraire à l'état
de nos rapports actuels, et qu'ils ne l'avaient employé que pour
abréger; sur quoi je fis sentir que, quel que fût le prix de la
brièveté, il ne la fallait point acheter aux dépens de l'exactitude.

  [193] Le 25 mars 1814, les souverains alliés, après la rupture des
  négociations de Châtillon, avaient signé à Laon une déclaration qui
  renouvelait le traité de Chaumont.

  [194] Variante: _n'attribuaient_.

Quant au contenu du protocole, c'était un tissu de raisonnements
métaphysiques destinés à faire valoir des prétentions que l'on
appuyait encore sur des traités à nous inconnus. Discuter ces
raisonnements et ces prétentions, c'eût été se jeter dans un océan de
disputes. Je sentis qu'il était nécessaire de repousser le tout par
un argument péremptoire. Je lus plusieurs paragraphes et je dis: «Je
ne comprends pas.» Je les relus de nouveau, posément, de l'air d'un
homme qui cherche à pénétrer le sens d'une chose, et je dis: «Je ne
comprends pas davantage.» J'ajoutai: «Il y a pour moi deux dates entre
lesquelles il n'y a rien: celle du 30 mai, où la formation du congrès
a été stipulée, et celle du 1er octobre, où il doit se réunir. Tout ce
qui s'est fait dans l'intervalle m'est étranger et n'existe pas pour
moi.» La réponse des plénipotentiaires fut qu'ils tenaient peu à cette
pièce et qu'ils ne demandaient pas mieux que de la retirer, ce qui
leur attira de la part de M. de Labrador l'observation que pourtant
ils l'avaient signée. Ils la reprirent; M. de Metternich la mit à
part[195] et il n'en fut plus question.

  [195] Variante: la mit _de côté_.

Après avoir abandonné cette pièce, ils en produisirent une autre.
C'était un projet de déclaration que M. de Labrador et moi devions
signer avec eux, si nous l'adoptions. Après un long préambule sur la
nécessité de simplifier et d'abréger les travaux du congrès, et après
des protestations de ne vouloir empiéter sur les droits de personne,
le projet établissait que les objets à régler par le congrès devaient
être divisés en deux séries, pour chacune desquelles il devait être
formé un comité auquel les États intéressés pourraient s'adresser; et
que les deux comités ayant achevé tout le travail, on assemblerait
alors pour la première fois le congrès, à la sanction duquel tout
serait soumis.

Ce projet avait évidemment pour but de rendre les quatre puissances
qui se disent _alliées_ maîtresses absolues de toutes les opérations
du congrès, puisque, dans l'hypothèse où les six puissances
principales se constitueraient juges des questions relatives à la
composition du congrès, aux objets qu'il devra régler, aux procédés à
suivre pour les régler, à l'ordre dans lequel ils devront être réglés,
et nommeraient seules et sans contrôle les comités qui devraient tout
préparer, la France et l'Espagne, même en les supposant toujours
d'accord sur toutes les questions, ne seraient jamais que deux contre
quatre.

Je déclarai que sur un projet de cette nature, une première lecture ne
suffisait pas pour se former une opinion, qu'il avait besoin d'être
médité, qu'il fallait avant tout s'assurer s'il était compatible avec
des droits que nous avions tous l'intention de respecter; que nous
étions venus pour consacrer et garantir[196] les droits de chacun, et
qu'il serait trop malheureux que nous débutassions par les violer; que
l'idée de tout arranger avant d'assembler le congrès était pour moi
une idée nouvelle; qu'on proposait de finir par où j'avais cru qu'il
était nécessaire de commencer; que peut-être le pouvoir qu'on
proposait d'attribuer aux six puissances, ne pouvait leur être donné
que par le congrès; qu'il y avait des mesures que des ministres sans
responsabilité pouvaient facilement adopter, mais que lord Castlereagh
et moi nous étions dans un cas tout différent. Ici lord Castlereagh a
dit que les réflexions que je venais de faire lui étaient toutes
venues à l'esprit, qu'il en sentait bien la force; mais, a-t-il
ajouté, «quel autre expédient trouver pour ne pas se jeter dans
d'inextricables longueurs?» J'ai demandé pourquoi dès à présent on ne
réunissait pas le congrès? quelles difficultés on y trouvait?--Chacun
alors a présenté la sienne; une conversation s'en est suivie dans
laquelle, à l'occasion de celui qui règne à Naples, M. de Labrador
s'est exprimé sans ménagement[197]. Pour moi, je m'étais contenté de
dire: «De quel roi de Naples parlez-vous? nous ne savons qui
c'est[198].»--Et sur ce que M. de Humboldt avait remarqué que des
puissances l'avaient reconnu et lui avaient garanti ses États, j'ai
reparti d'un ton ferme[199]: «Ceux qui les lui ont garantis ne l'ont
pas dû et, conséquemment, ne l'ont pas pu.» Et pour ne pas trop
prolonger l'effet que ce langage a visiblement produit[200], j'ai
ajouté: «Mais ce n'est pas de cela qu'il est maintenant question.»
Puis, revenant à celle du congrès, j'ai dit que les difficultés que
l'on paraissait craindre seraient peut-être moins grandes qu'on ne
l'avait cru; qu'il fallait chercher et qu'on trouverait sûrement le
moyen d'y obvier. Le prince de Hardenberg a annoncé qu'il ne tenait
point à tel expédient plutôt qu'à tel autre, mais qu'il en fallait un,
d'après lequel les princes de la Leyen et de Lichtenstein[201]
n'eussent point à intervenir dans les arrangements généraux de
l'Europe. Là-dessus, on s'est ajourné au surlendemain, après avoir
promis de m'envoyer, ainsi qu'à M. de Labrador, des copies du projet
de déclaration et de la lettre du comte de Palmella.

  [196] Variante: que nous étions venus pour garantir.

  [197] Variante: une conversation _générale_ s'en est suivie. _Le
  nom du roi de Naples s'étant présenté à quelqu'un_, M. de Labrador
  s'est exprimé _sur lui_ sans ménagement.

  [198] Variante: De quel roi de Naples _parle-t-on? Nous ne
  connaissons point l'homme dont il est question._

  [199] Variante: _j'ai dit_ d'un ton ferme et _froid._

  [200] Variante: _a véritablement_ et visiblement produit.

  [201] Deux des plus petites principautés de l'Allemagne. La
  principauté de Lichtenstein, notamment, ne comptait que sept mille
  habitants.

(Les différentes pièces dont il est question dans la lettre que j'ai
l'honneur d'écrire à Votre Majesté se trouvent jointes à la lettre que
j'écris aujourd'hui au département.)

Après les avoir reçues, et y avoir bien réfléchi, j'ai pensé qu'il ne
fallait point attendre la prochaine conférence pour faire connaître
mon opinion. Je rédigeai une réponse d'abord en forme de note verbale;
puis, venant à songer que les ministres des quatre cours ont eu entre
eux des conférences où ils tenaient des protocoles qu'ils signaient,
il me parut qu'il ne fallait pas qu'il n'y eût entre eux et le
ministre de Votre Majesté que des conversations dont il ne restait
aucune trace, et qu'une note officielle servirait convenablement à
nouer la négociation[202]. J'adressai donc le 1er octobre aux
ministres des cinq autres puissances une note signée, portant en
substance:

  [202] Variante: _servirait à nouer convenablement_.

«Que les huit puissances qui avaient signé le traité du 30 mai, me
paraissaient par cette circonstance seule[203], pleinement qualifiées
pour former une commission qui préparât pour la décision du congrès
les questions qu'il devait avant tout décider, et lui proposât la
formation des comités qu'il aurait été jugé expédient d'établir, et
les noms de ceux que l'on jugerait les plus propres à les former; mais
que leur compétence n'allant[204] point au delà, que n'étant point le
congrès, mais une partie seulement du congrès, si elles
s'attribuaient d'elles-mêmes un pouvoir qui ne peut appartenir qu'à
lui, il y aurait une usurpation, que je serais fort embarrassé, si
j'étais dans le cas d'y concourir, de concilier avec ma
responsabilité; que la difficulté que pouvait offrir la réunion du
congrès n'était pas de la nature de celles qui diminuent avec la
temps, et que, puisqu'elle devait être une fois vaincue, on ne pouvait
rien gagner en retardant; que les petits États ne devaient pas sans
doute, se mêler des arrangements généraux de l'Europe, mais qu'ils
n'en auraient pas même le désir, et ne seraient conséquemment point un
embarras; que par toutes ces considérations, j'étais naturellement
conduit à désirer que les huit puissances s'occupassent sans délai des
questions préliminaires à décider par le congrès, pour que l'on pût
promptement le réunir et les lui soumettre.»

  [203] Variante: _et à défaut de médiateur_.

  [204] Variante: _n'allait_.

Après avoir expédié cette note, je suis parti pour l'audience
particulière que m'avait fait annoncer l'empereur Alexandre. M. de
Nesselrode était venu me dire de sa part qu'il désirait de me voir
seul, et lui-même me l'avait rappelé la veille à un bal de la cour, où
j'avais eu l'honneur de me trouver avec lui. En m'abordant, il m'a
pris la main, mais son air n'était point affectueux comme à
l'ordinaire. Sa parole était brève, son maintien grave et peut-être un
peu solennel. J'ai vu clairement que c'était un rôle qu'il allait
jouer. «Avant tout, m'a-t-il dit, comment est la situation de votre
pays?--Aussi bien que Votre Majesté a pu le désirer, et mieux[205]
qu'on n'aurait osé l'espérer.--L'esprit public?--Il s'améliore chaque
jour.--Les idées libérales?--Il n'y en a nulle part plus qu'en
France.--Mais la liberté de la presse?--Elle est rétablie, à quelques
restrictions près, commandées par les circonstances[206]. Elles
cesseront dans deux ans, et n'empêcheront pas que jusque-là tout ce
qui est bon, et tout ce qui est utile ne soit publié.--Et
l'armée?--Elle est toute au roi. Cent trente mille hommes sont sous
les drapeaux, et au premier appel, trois cent mille pourront les
joindre.--Les maréchaux?--Lesquels, Sire?--Oudinot?--Il est dévoué au
roi.--Soult?--Il a eu d'abord un peu d'humeur. On lui a donné le
gouvernement de la Vendée; il s'y conduit à merveille; il s'y fait
aimer[207] et considérer.--Et Ney?--Il regrette un peu ses dotations;
Votre Majesté pourrait diminuer ses regrets.--Les deux Chambres? Il me
semble qu'il y a de l'opposition?--Comme partout où il y a des
assemblées délibérantes. Les opinions peuvent différer, mais les
affections sont unanimes, et dans la différence d'opinions, celle du
gouvernement a toujours une grande majorité.--Mais il n'y a pas
d'accord.--Qui a pu dire de telles choses à Votre Majesté? Quand après
vingt-cinq ans de révolution, le roi se trouve en quelques mois aussi
bien établi que s'il n'eût jamais quitté la France, quelle preuve plus
certaine peut-on avoir que tout marche vers un même but?--Votre
position personnelle?--La confiance et les bontés du roi passent mes
espérances.--A présent, parlons de nos affaires. Il faut que nous les
finissions ici.--Cela dépend de Votre Majesté. Elles finiront
promptement et heureusement si Votre Majesté y porte la même noblesse
et la même grandeur d'âme que dans celles de la France.--Mais il faut
que chacun y trouve ses convenances.--Et chacun ses droits.--Je
garderai ce que j'occupe.--Votre Majesté ne voudra garder que ce qui
sera légitimement à elle.--Je suis d'accord avec les grandes
puissances.--J'ignore si Votre Majesté compte la France au rang de ces
puissances.--Oui, sûrement. Mais si vous ne voulez point que chacun
trouve ses convenances, que prétendez-vous?--Je mets le droit d'abord,
et les convenances après.--Les convenances de l'Europe sont le
droit.--Ce langage, Sire, n'est pas le vôtre, il vous est étranger, et
votre coeur le désavoue.--Non; je le répète, les convenances de
l'Europe sont le droit.» Je me suis alors tourné vers le lambris, près
duquel j'étais, j'y ai appuyé ma tête, et frappant la boiserie, je me
suis écrié: «Europe, Europe, malheureuse Europe!» Et me retournant du
côté de l'empereur: «Sera-t-il dit, lui ai-je demandé, que vous
l'aurez perdue?» Il m'a répondu: «Plutôt la guerre, que de renoncer à
ce que j'occupe.» J'ai laissé tomber mes bras, et, dans l'attitude
d'un homme affligé, mais décidé, qui avait l'air de lui dire: «la
faute n'en sera pas à nous,» j'ai gardé le silence. L'empereur a été
quelques instants sans le rompre, puis il a répété: «Oui, plutôt la
guerre.»--J'ai conservé la même attitude. Alors, levant les mains et
les agitant comme je ne le lui avais jamais vu faire, et d'une manière
qui m'a rappelé le passage qui termine l'éloge de Marc Aurèle, il a
crié plutôt qu'il n'a dit: «Voilà l'heure du spectacle. Je dois y
aller, je l'ai promis à l'empereur, on m'attend.» Et il s'est éloigné;
puis la porte ouverte, revenant à moi, il m'a pris le corps de ses
deux mains, et il me l'a serré, en me disant avec une voix qui
n'était plus la sienne: «Adieu, adieu, nous nous reverrons.»

  [205] Variante: _meilleure_.

  [206] La charte avait garanti la liberté de la presse; mais une loi
  votée en septembre 1814 avait rétabli la censure pour une durée de
  deux ans.

  [207] Variante: il s'y _est_ fait aimer.

Dans toute cette conversation, dont je n'ai pu rendre à Votre Majesté
que la partie la plus saillante, la Pologne et la Saxe n'ont pas été
nommées une seule fois, mais seulement indiquées par des
circonlocutions. C'est ainsi que l'empereur voulait désigner la Saxe
en disant: _Ceux qui ont trahi la cause de l'Europe;_ à quoi j'ai été
dans le cas de répondre: «Sire, c'est là une question de dates», et,
après une légère pause, j'ai pu ajouter: «et l'effet des embarras dans
lesquels on a pu être jeté par les circonstances».

L'empereur, une fois, parla des _alliés_. Je relevai cette expression,
comme je l'avais fait à la conférence, et il la mit sur le compte de
l'habitude.

Hier, qui devait être le jour de la seconde conférence, M. de Mercy me
fut député par M. de Metternich, pour me dire qu'elle n'aurait pas
lieu.

Un ami de M. de Gentz l'étant allé voir dans l'après-midi, l'avait
trouvé très occupé d'un travail qu'il lui dit être très pressé. Je
crois que c'était d'une réponse à ma note.

Le soir, chez le prince de Trautmansdorf[208], les plénipotentiaires
me reprochèrent de la leur avoir adressée, et surtout de lui avoir
donné, en la signant, un caractère officiel. Je leur dis que comme ils
écrivaient et signaient entre eux, j'avais cru qu'il fallait aussi
écrire et signer. J'en conclus que ma note ne laissait pas que de les
embarrasser.

  [208] Conseiller d'État et grand chambellan de l'empereur
  d'Autriche (1749-1817).

Aujourd'hui, M. de Metternich m'a écrit qu'il y aurait conférence ce
soir à huit heures, puis il m'a fait dire qu'il n'y en aurait pas,
parce qu'il était mandé chez l'empereur.

Telle est, Sire, la situation présente des choses.

Votre Majesté voit que notre position ici est difficile. Elle peut le
devenir chaque jour davantage. L'empereur Alexandre donne à son
ambition tout son développement. Elle est excitée par M. de la Harpe
et le prince Czartoryski. La Prusse espère de grands accroissements.
L'Autriche, pusillanime, n'a qu'une ambition honteuse; mais elle est
complaisante pour être aidée. Et ce ne sont pas là les seules
difficultés. Il en est d'autres encore qui naissent des engagements
que les cours autrefois alliées ont pris, dans un temps[209] où elles
n'espéraient point abattre celui qu'elles ont vu renverser et où elles
se promettaient de faire avec lui une paix qui leur permît de
l'imiter.

  [209] Variante: _un sens_.

Aujourd'hui que Votre Majesté, replacée sur le trône, y a fait
remonter avec elle la justice, les puissances au profit desquelles ces
engagements ont été pris ne veulent pas y renoncer, et celles qui
regrettent peut-être d'être engagées ne savent comment se délier.
C'est, je crois, le cas de l'Angleterre[210]. Les ministres de Votre
Majesté pourraient donc rencontrer de tels obstacles qu'ils dussent
renoncer à toute autre espérance qu'à celle de sauver l'honneur. Mais
nous n'en sommes pas là.

Je suis...

  [210] Variante: ....._dont le ministre est faible_.

Nº 4 _bis._--LES AMBASSADEURS DU ROI AU CONGRÈS, AU MINISTRE DES
AFFAIRES ÉTRANGÈRES A PARIS.

Vienne, le 8 octobre 1814.

Monsieur le comte,

Dans notre dépêche du 4, nous avons eu l'honneur de vous dire que la
logique serrée que nous opposons aux quatre puissances qui se
présentent toujours comme liées entre elles par des arrangements
secrets, les embarrasse beaucoup.

Il est en effet naturel que ces puissances, qui tendent à faire
sanctionner par la France le renversement de tout principe qui fonde
le droit public, et à la fois consentir au dépouillement de la Saxe,
soient singulièrement gênées, lorsqu'elles trouvent cette même France
ne voulant marcher que d'accord avec la justice.

Quelque difficile que ce rôle soit à jouer avec des personnes qui
doutent de notre sincérité et qui ne veulent pas être arrêtées par des
principes de raison, tout ce qui nous revient nous confirme qu'il ne
faut pas quitter d'une ligne la route que nous tenons. Nous sentons
qu'elle est la seule qui puisse former une digue à opposer au
débordement de forces qui menace l'Europe, si on n'y porte une
sérieuse attention.

Nous avons l'honneur de vous rendre compte de ce qui a été fait depuis
notre dernière dépêche.

Lord Castlereagh a dressé un projet de déclaration que le prince de
Metternich a remis le 3 au soir au prince de Talleyrand. (Nº 1 des
pièces jointes.)

Elle n'a été communiquée que sous la forme d'un projet, mais sa
lecture confirme l'opinion que nous avions conçue: que «les quatre
grandes puissances alliées veulent, conformément à leurs arrangements,
continuer à suivre un système de convenance arrêté pour le cas où
Bonaparte serait resté sur le trône de France, et qu'elles ne comptent
pour rien le rétablissement de la maison de Bourbon, qui change tout
l'état de l'Europe, et au moyen duquel tout doit rentrer dans
l'ordre».

Au premier coup d'oeil, on voit qu'un grand danger doit résulter de ce
système, qu'un équilibre réel et durable devient impossible, et que,
vu la faiblesse du cabinet de Vienne, la France seule ne serait plus
maîtresse des événements que présente l'avenir.

Le prince de Talleyrand a répondu par une lettre particulière à lord
Castlereagh. Il s'attache à l'idée que le congrès doit être ouvert, et
que les puissances ne pouvaient que préparer et proposer, mais non
décider, seules, des matières d'un intérêt général.

Quoique cette lettre soit plutôt sous la forme d'un billet, elle est
cependant rédigée de manière à pouvoir un jour, si cela devenait
nécessaire, servir à éclairer l'Europe sur la marche que la France a
suivie dans les affaires du congrès. (Voyez nº 2.)

Depuis, le prince de Metternich a invité à une seconde conférence.

Le prince de Talleyrand et M. de Labrador y ont été appelés, mais on
n'y a pas vu le ministre de Suède, ni celui de Portugal.

Cette conférence n'a rien avancé. On a senti cependant qu'il fallait
instruire les différentes puissances des motifs qui retardaient
l'ouverture du congrès.

Le prince de Talleyrand a combattu le projet de lord Castlereagh comme
étant contraire au principe qui constitue le congrès et que l'article
XXXII du traité de Paris énonce formellement[211]. On s'est ensuite
accordé pour rédiger de nouveaux projets, et le prince de Talleyrand a
envoyé le lendemain, à M. de Metternich, celui qui pouvait servir à
cet usage. (Voyez nº 3.)

  [211] ARTICLE XXXII.--Dans le délai de deux mois, toutes les
  puissances qui ont été engagées de part et d'autre dans la présente
  guerre enverront des plénipotentiaires à Vienne, pour régler, dans
  un congrès général, les arrangements qui doivent compléter les
  dispositions du présent traité.

Ce projet, monsieur le comte, comme vous le jugerez à sa première
lecture, énonce à la fois:

Le principe qui réunit le congrès, les motifs du retard;

Les égards que l'on a pour les droits des puissances;

Et le principe d'après lequel chaque plénipotentiaire se voit admis.

D'après le principe qu'établit la déclaration, le roi de Saxe se
trouverait appelé et Murat exclu. Cependant l'exclusion de ce dernier
n'offre pas moins de difficultés que l'admission du premier, et nous
supposons qu'il existe entre la Russie, l'Angleterre et la Prusse, un
accord sur les points que nos instructions nous prescrivent de ne pas
admettre.

Il plaît souvent à M. le prince de Metternich de plaider la cause de
Murat et de menacer des obstacles qu'il présenterait à la tête de
quatre-vingt mille hommes, si, à la nouvelle de son exclusion, il
marchait sur l'intérieur de l'Italie. Nous faisons sentir que cette
inquiétude est sans fondement, et qu'il ne faudrait qu'un débarquement
de troupes françaises et espagnoles en Sicile, pour finir à jamais
cette comédie royale à laquelle personne ne peut vouloir prendre
part, et qui serait plus dangereuse à l'Autriche qu'à la France même.
Nous voyons à chaque pas que nous faisons que la difficulté principale
qui s'oppose à nos succès est celle qui tient au caractère timide des
ministres autrichiens et à l'apathie singulière de la nation; que la
Russie et la Prusse, portant cette conviction dans leurs calculs,
insisteront sur leurs injustes prétentions, et qu'il ne nous restera,
peut-être, qu'à déclarer que, protestant contre de telles violences,
la France n'y prend aucune part. Nous répétons souvent qu'il est
singulier que ce soit l'ambassade de France au congrès, qui se charge
de faire la besogne du ministère autrichien.

Lord Castlereagh manque également de force et de dignité dans cette
circonstance, et nous nous demandons quelquefois, comment il
justifiera un jour, devant sa nation, l'insouciance qu'il montre pour
les grands principes qui constituent les nations.

Les ministres de Bavière, de Danemark, de Sardaigne, commencent à
murmurer, et on nous a dit qu'ils se concertaient pour faire envers
les grandes puissances une démarche tendant à demander si le congrès
était formé, et où il devait s'assembler.

C'est nous qui avons insinué cette idée, et nous espérons que la
démarche aura lieu si les puissances tardent trop à s'expliquer.

Aujourd'hui vers le soir, le prince de Metternich a invité le prince
de Talleyrand à une nouvelle conférence, en le priant d'arriver chez
lui une heure avant la réunion générale, pour pouvoir traiter de
quelques objets importants.

Le résultat de cette conversation donne l'espoir que le prince de
Metternich se rapprochera de quelques-unes de nos idées, et qu'il
cherchera à concilier les prétentions des puissances avec les
principes que nous mettons en avant.

Dans la conférence générale à laquelle ont assisté les ministres de
Portugal et de Suède, on n'a pu s'accorder sur notre projet de
déclaration. Il a été arrêté de ne rien préjuger par un principe
inflexible et trop hautement prononcé, mais d'ajourner l'ouverture du
congrès au 1er novembre et d'essayer, pendant cet intervalle,
d'avancer les affaires par des communications confidentielles avec les
différentes puissances. C'est dans ce sens qu'un projet de déclaration
a été présenté par les autres ministres. Après de longs débats, le
prince de Talleyrand est parvenu à y faire ajouter cette phrase: «Que
les propositions à faire au congrès seraient conformes au _droit
public_ et à la juste attente de l'Europe.» Les autres ministres ont
essayé en vain d'écarter ce terme de _droit public_. Les ministres
prussiens s'y sont longtemps refusé, et ce n'est qu'après deux heures
de débats que l'insertion a été emportée pour ainsi dire à la pointe
de l'épée. On a vu clairement qu'ils voulaient finir les affaires,
plutôt par suite de leur accord, que conformément aux principes de
raison et de justice qui fondent proprement le droit public en Europe.

Nous avons l'honneur de vous adresser copie de cette déclaration qui,
à quelques corrections près, sera publiée telle qu'elle est. (Voyez nº
4.)

Nous n'avons pas, comme vous le voyez, monsieur le comte, obtenu une
victoire complète; mais les choses sont intactes, le principe est
maintenu et la déclaration laisse une grande latitude pour ménager
tous les intérêts auxquels nous devons veiller.

Le ministre de Bavière a fait, nous dit-on, une protestation formelle,
à l'égard de son exclusion du comité appelé à préparer les affaires.

Le prince de Metternich l'a radouci en lui faisant espérer que la
Bavière présiderait la commission qui aurait à s'occuper des affaires
d'Allemagne, et que, sous ce rapport, elle concourrait à tous les
arrangements généraux.

Agréez...

Nº 4.--LE PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND AU ROI LOUIS XVIII.

Vienne, le 9 octobre 1814.

SIRE,

Les ministres des quatre cours, embarrassés de ma note du 1er octobre,
et ne trouvant aucun argument pour la combattre, ont pris le parti de
s'en fâcher. «Cette note, a dit M. de Humboldt, est un brandon jeté
parmi nous.»--«On veut, a dit M. de Nesselrode, nous désunir; on n'y
parviendra pas;» avouant ainsi ouvertement, ce qu'il était facile de
soupçonner, qu'ils avaient fait entre eux une ligue pour se rendre
maîtres de tout et se constituer les arbitres suprêmes de l'Europe.
Lord Castlereagh, avec plus de mesure et d'un ton plus doux, m'a dit
que, dans leur intention, la conférence à laquelle ils nous avaient
appelés, M. de Labrador et moi, devait être toute confidentielle, et
que je lui avais ôté ce caractère en adressant une note, et surtout
une note officielle. J'ai répondu que c'était leur faute et non la
mienne; qu'ils m'avaient demandé mon opinion, que j'avais dû la
donner, et que si je l'avais donnée par écrit et signée, c'est
qu'ayant vu que, dans leurs conférences entre eux, ils écrivaient et
signaient, j'avais dû croire qu'il fallait que j'écrivisse et que je
signasse.

Cependant, le contenu de ma note ayant transpiré, ces messieurs, pour
en amortir l'effet, ont eu recours aux moyens habituels du cabinet de
Berlin. Ils ont répondu que les principes que je mettais en avant
n'étaient qu'un leurre; que nous demandions la rive gauche du Rhin;
que nous avions des vues sur la Belgique, et que nous voulions la
guerre. Cela m'est revenu de toute part. Mais j'ai ordonné à tout ce
qui entoure la légation de s'expliquer vis-à-vis de tout le monde avec
tant de simplicité et de candeur et d'une manière si positive, que les
auteurs de ces bruits absurdes ne recueilleront que la honte de les
avoir semés.

Le 3 octobre au soir, M. de Metternich, avec lequel je me trouvais
chez la duchesse de Sagan[212], me remit un nouveau projet de
déclaration, rédigé par lord Castlereagh; ce second projet ne
différait du premier qu'en ce qu'il tendait à faire considérer ce que
les quatre cours proposaient, comme n'étant qu'une conséquence du
premier des articles secrets du traité du 30 mai[213]. Mais, ni le
principe d'où il partait n'était juste (car lord Castlereagh prêtait
évidemment à l'une des dispositions de l'article un sens qu'elle n'a
pas et que nous ne saurions admettre); ni, quand le principe eût été
juste, la conséquence que l'on en tirait n'aurait été légitime; la
tentative était donc doublement malheureuse.

  [212] Sagan, ville de Silésie, chef-lieu d'une principauté possédée
  autrefois par le célèbre Wallenstein. Elle passa ensuite dans la
  famille des Biren, ducs de Courlande. Catherine-Wilhelmine, fille
  de Pierre duc de Courlande, lui succéda en 1800 comme duchesse de
  Sagan. C'est elle dont il est ici question. Elle mourut en 1839. Sa
  soeur Pauline lui succéda. En 1844, le duché revint à Dorothée,
  troisième fille du duc Pierre de Courlande, qui avait épousé Edmond
  duc de Dino, et plus tard de Talleyrand-Périgord, neveu du prince
  de Talleyrand.

  [213] Voici cet article:

  La disposition à faire des territoires auxquels Sa Majesté Très
  Chrétienne renonce par l'article III du traité patent, et les
  rapports desquels doit résulter un système d'équilibre réel et
  durable en Europe, _seront réglés au congrès, sur les bases
  arrêtées par les puissances alliées entre elles_ et d'après les
  dispositions générales contenues dans les articles suivants, etc.

J'écrivis à lord Castlereagh. Je donnai à ma lettre une forme
confidentielle. Je m'attachai à réunir toutes les raisons qui
militaient contre le plan proposé. (La copie de ma lettre est jointe à
la dépêche que j'écris aujourd'hui au département.) Votre Majesté
verra que je me suis particulièrement attaché à faire sentir, avec
toute la politesse possible, que le motif pour lequel on avait proposé
ce plan ne m'avait pas échappé. J'ai cru devoir déclarer qu'il m'était
impossible de concourir à rien de ce qui serait contraire aux
principes, parce que, à moins d'y rester invariablement attachés, nous
ne pouvions reprendre aux yeux des nations de l'Europe le rang et la
considération qui doivent nous appartenir depuis le retour de Votre
Majesté, et, parce que, nous en écarter, ce serait faire revivre la
Révolution, qui n'en avait été qu'un long oubli.

J'ai su que lord Castlereagh, quand il reçut ma lettre, la fit lire au
ministre de Portugal, qui se trouvait chez lui, et qui lui avoua qu'en
droit nous avions raison; mais en ajoutant qu'il fallait encore savoir
si ce que nous proposions était praticable, ce qui était demander, en
autres termes, si les quatre cours pouvaient se dispenser de s'arroger
sur l'Europe un pouvoir que l'Europe ne leur a point donné.

Nous eûmes, ce jour-là, une conférence où nous ne nous trouvâmes
d'abord que deux ou trois, les autres ministres n'arrivant qu'à un
quart d'heure les uns des autres. Lord Castlereagh avait apporté ma
lettre pour la communiquer. On la fit passer de mains en mains. MM. de
Metternich et de Nesselrode y jetèrent à peine un simple coup
d'oeil[214], en hommes à la pénétration desquels la seule
inspection[215] d'une pièce suffit pour en saisir tout le contenu.
J'avais été prévenu qu'on me demanderait de retirer ma note. M. de
Metternich me fit en effet cette demande. Je répondis que je ne le
pouvais pas. M. de Labrador dit qu'il était trop tard, que cela ne
servirait à rien, parce qu'il en avait envoyé une copie à sa cour. «Il
faudra donc que nous vous répondions, dit M. de Metternich.--Si vous
le voulez, lui répondis-je.--Je serais, reprit-il, assez d'avis que
nous réglassions nos affaires tout seuls,» entendant par _nous_ les
quatre cours. Je répondis sans hésiter: «Si vous prenez la question de
ce côté, je suis tout à fait votre homme; je suis tout prêt; je ne
demande pas mieux.--Comment l'entendez-vous? me dit-il.--D'une manière
très simple, lui répondis-je. Je ne prendrai plus part à vos
conférences; je ne serai ici qu'un membre du congrès, et j'attendrai
qu'il s'ouvre.» Au lieu de renouveler sa proposition, M. de Metternich
revint par degrés et par divers circuits à des propositions générales
sur l'inconvénient qu'aurait l'ouverture actuelle du congrès. M. de
Nesselrode dit sans trop de réflexion que l'empereur Alexandre voulait
partir le 25, à quoi je dus répondre d'un ton assez indifférent: «J'en
suis fâché, car il ne verra pas la fin des affaires.--Comment
assembler le congrès, dit M. de Metternich, quand rien de ce dont on
aura à l'occuper n'est prêt?--Eh bien! répondis-je, pour montrer que
ce n'est point un esprit de difficultés qui m'anime, et que je suis
disposé à tout ce qui peut s'accorder avec les principes que je ne
saurais abandonner, puisque rien n'est prêt encore pour l'ouverture du
congrès, puisque vous désirez de l'ajourner, qu'il soit retardé de
quinze jours, de trois semaines, j'y consens; mais à deux conditions:
l'une, que vous le convoquerez dès à présent pour un jour fixe;
l'autre, que vous établirez dans la note de convocation la règle
d'après laquelle on doit y être admis.»

  [214] Variante: un coup d'oeil.

  [215] Variante: la _simple_ inspection.

J'écrivis cette règle sur un papier, telle à peu près qu'elle se
trouve dans les instructions que Votre Majesté a données[216]. Le
papier circula de mains en mains; on fit quelques questions, quelques
objections, mais sans rien résoudre, et les ministres, qui étaient
venus les uns après les autres, s'en retournant de même, la conférence
s'évapora pour ainsi dire plutôt qu'elle ne finit.

  [216] Variante: _nous_ a données.

Lord Castlereagh, qui était resté des derniers et avec lequel je
descendais l'escalier, essaya de me ramener à leur opinion, en me
faisait entendre que de certaines affaires qui devaient le plus
intéresser ma cour pourraient s'arranger à ma satisfaction. «Ce n'est
point, lui dis-je, de tels ou tels objets particuliers qu'il est
maintenant question, mais du droit qui doit servir à les régler tous.
Si une fois le fil est rompu, comment le renouerons-nous? Nous avons à
répondre aux voeux[217] de l'Europe. Qu'aurons nous fait pour elle, si
nous n'avons pas remis en honneur les maximes dont l'oubli a causé ses
maux? L'époque présente est une de celles qui se présentent à peine
une fois dans le cours[218] de plusieurs siècles. Une plus belle
occasion ne saurait nous être offerte. Pourquoi ne pas nous mettre
dans une position qui y réponde?--Eh! me dit il avec une sorte
d'embarras, c'est qu'il y a des difficultés que vous ne connaissez
pas.--Non, je ne les connais pas,» lui répondis-je du ton d'un homme
qui n'avait aucune curiosité de les connaître. Nous nous séparâmes.

  [217] Variante: _au voeu_.

  [218] Variante: _un_ cours.

Je dînai chez le prince Windischgrætz[219]. M. de Gentz y était. Nous
causâmes longtemps sur les points discutés dans les conférences
auxquelles il avait assisté. Il parut regretter que je ne fusse point
arrivé plus tôt à Vienne; il se plaisait à croire que les choses dont
il se portait pour être mécontent eussent pu prendre une tournure
différente. Il finit par m'avouer qu'au fond on sentait que j'avais
raison, mais que l'amour-propre s'en mêlait, et qu'après s'être
avancés, il coûtait aux mieux intentionnés de reculer.

  [219] Alfred prince de Windischgrætz, d'une ancienne et illustre
  famille de Styrie. Il naquit à Bruxelles en 1787, entra dans
  l'armée et devint général. Toutefois son nom ne devint célèbre
  qu'en 1848. Il commandait alors à Prague, et eut à réprimer une
  insurrection terrible. Il en vint à bout, et fut en récompense
  nommé feld-maréchal. Il s'empara ensuite de Vienne, qui était
  tombée au pouvoir de l'émeute, et fut envoyé en Hongrie, également
  soulevée. Mais il échoua dans cette dernière tâche et fut rappelé.
  Il mourut en 1862.

Deux jours se passèrent sans conférence. Une fête un jour, une chasse
l'autre, en furent la cause. Dans cet intervalle je fus présenté à
madame la duchesse d'Oldenbourg[220]. Je lui exprimai des regrets de
ce qu'elle n'était point venue à Paris avec son frère. Elle me
répondit que ce voyage[221] n'était que retardé; puis elle passa tout
à coup à des questions telles que l'empereur m'en avait faites sur
Votre Majesté, sur l'esprit public, sur les finances, sur l'armée,
questions qui m'auraient fort surpris de la part d'une femme de
vingt-deux ans, si elles n'eussent[222] paru contraster davantage avec
sa démarche, son regard et le son de sa voix. Je répondis à tout dans
un sens conforme aux choses que nous avons à faire ici, et aux
intérêts que nous avons à y défendre.

  [220] Catherine Paulowna, soeur de l'empereur Alexandre, née en 1795
  veuve en 1812 de Pierre-Frédéric-Georges, grand-duc d'Oldenbourg,
  remariée en 1816 au roi de Wurtemberg.

  [221] Variante: _qu'elle espérait que_ ce voyage.

  [222] Variante: si elles _m'_eussent.

Elle me questionna encore sur le roi d'Espagne, sur son frère, sur son
oncle, parlant d'eux en termes assez peu convenables; et je répondis
du ton que je crus le plus propre à donner du poids à mon opinion sur
le mérite personnel de ces princes.

M. de Gentz, qui vint chez moi au moment où je rentrais de chez la
duchesse d'Oldenbourg, me dit qu'on l'avait chargé de dresser un
projet de convocation du congrès. Le jour précédent j'en avais fait un
conforme à ce que j'avais proposé dans la conférence de la veille, et
je l'avais envoyé à M. de Metternich en le priant de le communiquer
aux autres ministres. M. de Gentz m'assura qu'il n'en avait pas
connaissance. Il me dit que dans le sien, il n'était point question de
la règle d'admission que j'avais proposée, parce que M. de Metternich
craignait qu'en la publiant, on ne poussât à quelque extrémité celui
qui règne à Naples, son plénipotentiaire se trouvant par là exclu.
Nous discutâmes ce point, M. de Gentz et moi, et il se montra
persuadé que ce que craignait M. de Metternich n'arriverait pas.

Je m'attendais à une conférence le lendemain. Mais les trois quarts de
la journée s'étant écoulés sans que j'eusse entendu parler de rien, je
n'y comptais plus, lorsque je reçus un billet de M. de Metternich qui
m'annonçait qu'il y en aurait une à huit heures, et que si je voulais
venir chez lui un peu auparavant, _il trouverait le moyen de
m'entretenir d'objets très importants_. (Ce sont les termes de son
billet.) J'étais chez lui à sept heures; sa porte me fut ouverte
sur-le-champ. Il me parla d'abord d'un projet de déclaration qu'il
avait fait rédiger, qui différait, me dit-il, un peu du mien, mais qui
s'en rapprochait beaucoup, et dont il espérait que je serais content.
Je le lui demandai; il ne l'avait pas. «Probablement, lui dis-je, il
est en communication chez les alliés?--Ne parlez plus d'alliés[223],
reprit-il, il n'y en a plus.--Il y a ici des gens, _lui dis-je_[224],
qui devraient l'être en ce sens que, même sans se concerter, ils
devraient penser de la même manière et vouloir les mêmes choses.
Comment avez-vous le courage de placer la Russie comme une ceinture
tout autour de vos principales et plus importantes possessions, la
Hongrie et la Bohême? Comment pouvez-vous souffrir que le patrimoine
d'un ancien et bon voisin, dans la famille duquel une archiduchesse
est mariée, soit donné à votre ennemi naturel[225]? Il est étrange
que ce soit nous qui voulions nous y opposer et que ce soit vous qui
ne le vouliez pas!...» Il me dit que je n'avais pas de confiance en
lui. Je lui répondis _en riant_[226], qu'il ne m'avait pas donné
beaucoup de motifs d'en avoir; et je lui rappelai quelques
circonstances où il ne m'avait pas tenu parole: «Et puis, ajoutai-je,
comment prendre confiance en un homme qui pour ceux qui sont le plus
disposés à faire leur affaire des siennes est tout mystère? Pour moi,
je n'en fais point et je n'en ai pas besoin: c'est l'avantage de ceux
qui ne négocient qu'avec des principes. Voilà, poursuivis-je, du
papier et des plumes. Voulez-vous écrire que la France ne demande
rien, et même n'accepterait rien? Je suis prêt à le signer.--Mais vous
avez, me dit-il, l'affaire de Naples, qui est proprement la vôtre.» Je
répondis: «Pas plus la mienne que celle de tout le monde. Ce n'est
pour moi qu'une affaire de principe. Je demande que celui qui a droit
d'être à Naples soit à Naples, et rien de plus. Or c'est ce que tout
le monde doit vouloir comme moi. Qu'on suive les principes, on me
trouvera facile pour tout. Je vais vous dire franchement à quoi je
peux consentir et à quoi je ne consentirai jamais. Je sens que le roi
de Saxe, dans sa position présente[227], peut être obligé à des
sacrifices. Je suppose qu'il sera disposé à les faire, parce qu'il est
sage: mais si on veut le dépouiller de tous ses États, et donner le
royaume de Saxe à la Prusse, je n'y consentirai jamais. Je ne
consentirai jamais à ce que Luxembourg ni Mayence soient non plus
donnés à la Prusse. Je ne consentirai pas davantage à ce que la
Russie passe la Vistule, ait en Europe quarante-quatre millions de
sujets et ses frontières à l'Oder. Mais si Luxembourg est donné à la
Hollande, Mayence à la Bavière; si le roi et le royaume de Saxe sont
conservés, et si la Russie ne passe pas la Vistule, je n'aurai point
d'objection à faire pour cette partie de l'Europe[228].» M. de
Metternich m'a pris alors la main en me disant: «Nous sommes beaucoup
moins éloignés que vous ne pensez. Je vous promets que la Prusse
n'aura ni Luxembourg ni Mayence. Nous ne désirons[229] pas plus que
vous que la Russie s'agrandisse outre mesure, et, quant à la Saxe,
nous ferons ce qui sera en nous pour en conserver du moins une
partie.» Ce n'était que pour connaître ses dispositions relativement à
ces divers objets que je lui avais parlé comme j'avais fait.--Revenant
ensuite à la convocation du congrès, il a insisté sur la nécessité de
ne point publier en ce moment la règle d'admission que j'avais
proposée, «parce que, disait-il, elle effarouche tout le monde; et que
moi-même, elle me gêne quant à présent; attendu que Murat, voyant son
plénipotentiaire exclu, croira son affaire décidée, qu'on ne sait ce
que sa tête peut lui faire faire; qu'il est en mesure en Italie, et
que nous ne le sommes pas».

  [223] Variante: Ne parlez _donc_ plus.

  [224] Supprimé dans le texte des archives.

  [225] Il s'agit de la Saxe. Le prince Antoine, frère du roi
  Frédéric-Auguste, avait épousé: 1º Marie-Charlotte-Antoinette,
  fille de l'empereur Léopold morte en 1782; 2º en 1787,
  Marie-Thérése-Josèphe, autre fille de l'empereur Léopold, née en
  1767.

  [226] Supprimé dans le texte des archives.

  [227] Variante: dans _la_ position présente.

  [228] Variante: pour cette partie-_là_.

  [229] Variante: Nous ne _tenons_ pas.

On nous prévint que les ministres étaient réunis. Nous nous
rendîmes[230] à la conférence. M. de Metternich l'ouvrit en annonçant
qu'il allait donner lecture de deux projets, l'un rédigé par moi,
l'autre qu'il avait fait rédiger. Les Prussiens se déclarèrent pour
celui de M. de Metternich, disant qu'il ne préjugeait rien et que le
mien préjugeait beaucoup. M. de Nesselrode fut du même avis. Le
ministre de Suède, M. de Löwenhielm[231], qui, pour la première fois,
assistait aux conférences, dit qu'il ne fallait rien préjuger. C'était
aussi l'opinion de lord Castlereagh, et je savais que c'était celle de
M. de Metternich. Ce projet se bornait à ajourner l'ouverture du
congrès au 1er novembre et ne disait rien de plus, ce qui a donné lieu
à M. de Palmella, ministre de Portugal, d'observer qu'une seconde
déclaration pour convoquer le congrès serait nécessaire, et l'on en
est convenu. On ne faisait donc qu'ajourner la difficulté, sans la
résoudre. Mais, comme les anciennes prétentions étaient abandonnées,
comme il n'était plus question de faire régler tout par les huit
puissances en ne laissant au congrès que la faculté d'approuver; comme
on ne parlait plus que de préparer par des communications libres et
confidentielles avec les ministres des autres puissances, les
questions sur lesquelles le congrès devrait prononcer, j'ai cru qu'un
acte de complaisance qui ne porterait aucune atteinte aux principes
pourrait être utile à l'avancement des affaires, et j'ai déclaré que
je consentais à l'adoption du projet, mais sous la condition qu'à
l'endroit où il était dit que l'ouverture formelle du congrès serait
ajournée au 1er novembre, on ajouterait: _et sera faite conformément
aux principes du droit public_. A ces mots, il s'est élevé un tumulte
dont on ne pourrait que difficilement se faire d'idée. M. de
Hardenberg, debout, les poings sur la table, presque menaçant, et
criant comme il est ordinaire à ceux qui sont affligés de la même
infirmité que lui, proférait ces paroles entrecoupées: «Non,
monsieur..., le droit public, c'est inutile. Pourquoi dire que nous
agirons selon le droit public? Cela va sans dire.» Je lui répondis que
si cela allait bien sans le dire, cela irait encore mieux en le
disant. M. de Humboldt criait: «Que fait ici le droit public?» A quoi
je répondais[232]: «Il fait que vous y êtes.» Lord Castlereagh me
tirant à l'écart, me demanda si, quand on aurait cédé sur ce point à
mes désirs, je serais ensuite plus facile. Je lui demandai à mon tour
ce qu'en me montrant facile, je pouvais espérer qu'il ferait dans
l'affaire de Naples. Il me promit de me seconder de toute son
influence: «J'en parlerai, me dit-il, à Metternich; j'ai le droit
d'avoir un avis sur cette matière.--Vous m'en donnez votre parole
d'honneur, lui dis-je.--Je vous la donne, me répondit-il.--Et moi,
repartis-je, je vous donne la mienne de n'être difficile que sur les
principes que je ne saurais abandonner.» Cependant, M. de Gentz,
s'étant approché de M. de Metternich, lui représenta qu'on ne pouvait
refuser de parler du droit public dans un acte de la nature de celui
dont il s'agissait. M. de Metternich avait auparavant proposé de
mettre la chose aux voix, trahissant ainsi l'usage qu'ils auraient
fait de la faculté qu'ils avaient voulu se donner, si leur premier
plan eût été admis. On finit par consentir à l'addition[233] que je
demandais, mais il y eut une discussion non moins vive pour savoir où
elle serait placée; et l'on convint enfin de la placer une phrase
plus haut que celle où j'avais proposé qu'on la mît. M. de Gentz ne
put s'empêcher de dire dans la conférence même: «Cette soirée,
messieurs, appartient à l'histoire du congrès. Ce n'est pas moi qui la
raconterai, parce que mon devoir s'y oppose, mais elle s'y trouvera
certainement.» Il m'a dit depuis qu'il n'avait jamais rien vu de
pareil.

  [230] Variante: nous nous _rendions_.

  [231] Gustave de Löwenhielm, né en 1771, était officier dans
  l'armée suédoise. Il fut aide de camp de Gustave III et plus tard
  de Bernadotte. Il quitta, en 1814, les armes pour la diplomatie,
  fut envoyé au congrès de Vienne, et ensuite fut nommé ambassadeur à
  Paris. Il mourut en 1856.

  [232] Variante: _répondis_.

  [233] Variante: _l'admission_.

 C'est pourquoi je regarde comme heureux d'avoir pu, sans abandonner
 les principes, faire quelque chose qu'on puisse regarder comme un
 acheminement vers la réunion du congrès.

 M. de Löwenhielm est ministre de Suède en Russie, et tout Russe. C'est
 vraisemblablement pour cela qu'il a été envoyé ici, le prince royal de
 Suède[234] voulant tout ce que veulent les Russes.

font déjà entre eux des projets pour l'organisation de l'Allemagne.

Nº 5 _bis._--LES AMBASSADEURS DU ROI AU CONGRÈS, AU MINISTRE DES
AFFAIRES ÉTRANGÈRES A PARIS.

Vienne, le 12 octobre 1814.

Monsieur le comte,

Nous avons l'honneur de vous adresser un exemplaire imprimé de la
déclaration faite au nom des puissances qui ont signé le traité de
Paris. On prétend que nous avons remporté une victoire pour y avoir
fait introduire le mot de _droit public_. Cette opinion doit vous
donner la mesure de l'esprit qui anime le congrès.

Il se peut que l'ajournement inquiète les esprits; il est sûr d'un
autre côté qu'on ne rend point encore assez de justice aux principes
qui guident le roi dans ses relations politiques. Depuis vingt ans,
l'Europe a été habituée à n'apprécier que la force et à craindre ses
abus. Personne ne se livre encore à l'espoir et à la conviction qu'une
grande puissance veuille être modérée.

Il nous a donc paru utile que la publication de cette pièce, la
première qui résulte des travaux politiques du congrès, soit
accompagnée de quelques observations qui mettent l'action de la France
et son influence actuelle dans son vrai jour.

Nous avons l'honneur, monsieur le comte, de vous adresser celles que
nous croyons pouvoir servir au _Moniteur_, et dont l'esprit peut
donner la direction à quelques autres articles des journaux.

Nous avons l'espoir que l'Autriche appuiera la résistance que nous
opposons dans toutes les circonstances à la cupidité que manifestent
la Russie et la Prusse, et nous mesurerons la force de notre langage
au degré de confiance que nous prendrons dans l'énergie de cette
puissance.

Nous croyons être sûrs qu'elle ne s'est pas engagée à sanctionner la
destruction de la Saxe, et il sera déjà utile que le cabinet de Vienne
concoure avec nous pour protester contre une pareille violence. Nous
observons généralement que la Russie inquiète l'Allemagne, et que,
sans l'appui de la Prusse, son système fédératif manquerait de bases.

Nous avons eu occasion de parler des dotations et nous cherchons à
sauver autant d'intérêts particuliers que cela nous est possible. Mais
cette affaire est placée sous l'influence de l'alliance contractée par
les alliés à Chaumont. Une puissance paraît avoir donné la parole à
l'autre de ne rien accorder, et on répond que le principe ne peut plus
être attaqué.

Vous sentez, monsieur le comte, que tant que nous aurons à négocier
avec des puissances qui prennent le caractère de coalisés, on ne peut
même pas faire valoir le principe que les domaines donnés dans les
pays qui étaient cédés par les traités doivent être laissés aux
donataires. Cela n'empêche pourtant pas qu'en toute occasion nous ne
cherchions à ménager les intérêts particuliers auxquels nous croyons
pouvoir donner quelque appui.

L'empereur de Russie a parlé hier à l'ambassadeur d'Angleterre, lord
Stewart[235], du rétablissement de la Pologne, en indiquant qu'il
voulait faire nommer roi un de ses frères. Bientôt cette question
devra être abordée. Nous pensons que l'empereur de Russie n'a point
encore d'idées bien fixes à ce sujet, et qu'il tâte les moyens qui
peuvent le rendre maître de ce pays.

Agréez...

 [235] Charles William Stewart, comte Vane, et plus tard marquis de
 Londonderry, après la mort de son frère lord Castlereagh, né en
 1778 à Dublin. Il entra à l'armée et était colonel en 1803,
 lorsqu'il fut nommé sous-secrétaire d'État au ministère de la
 guerre. Il servit ensuite en Espagne comme brigadier-général. En
 1815, il fut nommé ambassadeur à Vienne et plénipotentiaire au
 congrès. Il se retira en 1819, et n'occupa plus de fonctions
 publiques jusqu'à sa mort (1854).

Nº 5.--LE PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND AU ROI LOUIS XVIII.

Vienne, le 13 octobre 1814.

Sire,

J'ai envoyé, dans la dépêche adressée au département, la déclaration
telle qu'elle a été publiée hier matin[236]. Elle ajourne l'ouverture
du congrès au 1er novembre. Il y a été fait quelques changements, mais
d'expressions seulement, sur lesquels les ministres se sont entendus
sans se réunir, et par l'intermédiaire de M. de Gentz. Nous n'avons
point eu de conférences depuis le 8, ni, par conséquent, de ces
discussions dont je crains bien d'avoir fatigué Votre Majesté dans mes
deux dernières lettres.

  [236] Variante: _ce_ matin.

Le ministre de Prusse à Londres, le vieux Jacobi Kloest[237] a été
appelé ici au secours de M. de Humboldt. C'est un des aigles de la
diplomatie prussienne. Il m'est venu voir; c'est une ancienne
connaissance. La conversation l'a mené promptement à me parler des
grandes difficultés qui se présentaient, et dont la plus grande, selon
lui, venait de l'empereur Alexandre, qui voulait avoir le duché de
Varsovie. Je lui dis que si l'empereur Alexandre voulait avoir le
duché, il se présenterait probablement avec une cession du roi de
Saxe, et qu'alors on verrait. «Pourquoi du roi de Saxe, reprit-il tout
étonné.--C'est, répondis-je, que le duché lui appartient en vertu des
cessions que vous et l'Autriche lui avez faites, et de traités que
vous, l'Autriche et la Russie avez signés.» Alors, de l'air d'un
homme qui vient de faire une découverte et à qui l'on révèle une chose
tout à fait inattendue: «C'est parbleu vrai, dit-il, le duché lui
appartient.» Du moins, M. de Jacobi n'est pas de ceux qui croient que
la souveraineté se perd et s'acquiert par le seul fait de la conquête.

  [237] Le baron de Jacobi Kloest, diplomate prussien, né en 1745,
  ambassadeur de Prusse à Vienne en 1790, puis à Londres (1792), où
  il resta jusqu'en 1816. En 1799, il représenta la Prusse au congrès
  de Rastadt et prit hautement la défense des plénipotentiaires
  français assassinés par les hussards autrichiens. Il mourut en
  1817.

J'ai lieu de croire que nous obtiendrons pour le roi d'Étrurie Parme,
Plaisance et Guastalla; mais, dans ce cas, il ne faut plus penser à la
Toscane, à laquelle cependant il aurait des droits. L'empereur
d'Autriche a déjà fait pressentir à l'archiduchesse Marie-Louise qu'il
avait peu d'espoir de lui conserver Parme.

On demande souvent autour de moi, et lord Castlereagh m'en a parlé
directement, si le traité du 11 avril[238] reçoit son exécution. Le
silence du budget à cet égard a été remarqué par l'empereur de Russie.
M. de Metternich dit que l'Autriche ne peut être tenue d'acquitter ce
qui est affecté sur le Mont de Milan[239], si la France n'exécute
point les clauses du traité qui sont à sa charge. En tout, cette
affaire se reproduit sous différentes formes, et presque toujours
d'une manière désagréable. Quelque pénible qu'il soit d'arrêter son
esprit sur ce genre d'affaires, je ne puis m'empêcher de dire à Votre
Majesté qu'il est à désirer que quelque chose soit fait à cet égard.
Une lettre de M. de Jaucourt qui, par ordre de Votre Majesté, me
l'apprendrait, serait certainement d'un bon effet.

  [238] Le traité du 11 avril 1814, signé entre la Prusse, l'Autriche
  et la Russie, avec accession de l'Angleterre, d'une part, et
  Napoléon, de l'autre, avait pour but de déterminer la situation de
  l'empereur et de sa famille (voir t. II, p. 166). On se rappelle
  qu'une dotation de deux millions cinq cent mille francs lui était
  promise.

  [239] Banque d'État créée à Milan par Napoléon sous le nom de Mont
  Napoléon. L'empereur et les membres de sa famille y avaient des
  fonds déposés, et l'Autriche, d'après l'article XIII du traité du
  11 avril, s'était engagée à en payer les arrérages.

On montre ici une intention assez arrêtée d'éloigner Bonaparte de
l'île d'Elbe. Personne n'a encore d'idée fixe sur le lieu où on
pourrait le mettre. J'ai proposé l'une des Açores. C'est à cinq cents
lieues d'aucune terre. Lord Castlereagh ne paraît pas éloigné de
croire que les Portugais pourraient être amenés à se prêter à cet
arrangement; mais, dans cette discussion, la question d'argent
reparaîtra. Le fils de Bonaparte n'est plus traité maintenant comme
dans les premiers temps de son arrivée à Vienne. On y met moins
d'appareil et plus de simplicité. On lui a ôté le grand cordon de la
Légion d'honneur et on y substitue[240] celui de Saint-Étienne.

  [240] Variante: on y _a substitué_.

L'empereur Alexandre ne parle, suivant son usage, que des idées
libérales. Je ne sais si ce sont elles qui lui ont persuadé que, pour
faire sa cour à ses hôtes, il devait aller à Wagram contempler le
théâtre de leur défaite. Ce qu'il y a de certain, c'est qu'il a fait
chercher par M. de Czernicheff des officiers qui, ayant assisté à
cette bataille, pussent lui faire connaître les positions et les
mouvements des deux armées qu'il se plaît à étudier sur le terrain. On
a répondu avant-hier à l'archiduc Jean[241], qui demandait où était
l'empereur: «Monseigneur, il est à Wagram.» Il paraît qu'il doit
aller d'ici peu de jours à Pesth, où il a demandé un bal pour le
19[242]. Son projet est d'y paraître en habit hongrois. Avant ou après
le bal, il doit aller pleurer sur le tombeau de sa soeur[243]. A cette
cérémonie doivent se trouver une foule de Grecs qu'il a fait prévenir
d'avance et qui s'empresseront sûrement de venir voir le seul monarque
qui soit de leur rite. Je ne sais jusqu'à quel point tout cela plaît à
cette cour-ci, mais je doute que cela lui plaise beaucoup.

  [241] L'archiduc Jean était le septième fils de l'empereur Léopold.
  Né en 1782, il commandait en chef l'armée autrichienne à
  Hohenlinden. En 1801, il devint directeur général des
  fortifications. Il eut également des commandements importants en
  1805 et en 1809. Tombé on disgrâce, il ne joua aucun rôle militaire
  dans les dernières luttes de 1813 et 1814, et vécut à l'écart
  jusqu'en 1848. Le parlement réuni à Francfort le nomma alors
  vicaire de l'empire d'Allemagne. En même temps l'empereur l'avait
  désigné comme lieutenant général en Autriche. Il gouverna quelque
  temps en qualité de vicaire de l'empire, mais les événements qui
  survinrent le forcèrent à se retirer. Il mourut en 1859.

  [242] Variante: il _y a_ demandé.

  [243] La grande-duchesse Alexandra Paulowna, née en 1783, mariée en
  1799 à l'archiduc Joseph-Antoine, frère de l'empereur François,
  palatin du royaume de Hongrie, morte en 1801.

Lord Stewart, frère de lord Castlereagh et ambassadeur près de la cour
de Vienne, est arrivé depuis quelques jours. Il a été présenté à
l'empereur Alexandre qui lui a dit, à ce qu'il m'a raconté: «Nous
allons faire une belle et grande chose: relever la Pologne[244] en lui
donnant pour roi un de mes frères ou le mari de ma soeur[245]» (la
duchesse d'Oldenbourg). Lord Stewart lui a dit franchement: «Je ne
vois pas là d'indépendance pour la Pologne, et je ne crois pas que
l'Angleterre, quoique moins intéressée que les autres puissances,
puisse s'accommoder de cet arrangement.»

  [244] Variante: _nous allons_ relever.

  [245] Il y a ici une erreur. Le prince Pierre-Frédéric-Georges, duc
  d'Oldenbourg, marié à la grande-duchesse Catherine, soeur
  d'Alexandre, était mort en 1812.

Ou je me trompe beaucoup, ou l'union entre les quatre cours est plus
apparente que réelle, et tient uniquement à cette circonstance que les
unes ne veulent pas nous supposer les moyens d'agir, et que les
autres ne croient pas que nous en ayons la volonté. Ceux qui nous
savent contraires à leurs prétentions pensent que nous n'avons que des
raisonnements à leur opposer. L'empereur Alexandre disait, il y a peu
de jours: «Talleyrand fait ici le ministre de Louis XIV.» M. de
Humboldt, cherchant à séduire en même temps qu'à intimider M. de
Schulenburg, ministre de Saxe, lui disait: «Le ministre de France se
présente ici avec des paroles assez nobles; mais, ou elles cachent une
arrière pensée, ou il n'y a rien derrière pour les soutenir. Malheur
donc à ceux qui voudraient y croire.»

Le moyen de faire tomber tous ces propos et de faire cesser toutes les
irrésolutions serait que Votre Majesté, dans une déclaration qu'elle
adresserait à ses peuples, après avoir fait connaître les principes
qu'elle nous a ordonné de suivre et sa ferme résolution de ne s'en
écarter jamais, laissât seulement entrevoir que la cause juste ne
resterait pas sans appui. Une telle déclaration, comme je la conçois
et comme j'en soumettrais[246] le projet à Votre Majesté, ne mènerait
pas à la guerre, que personne ne veut; mais elle porterait ceux qui
ont des prétentions, à les modérer, et donnerait aux autres le courage
de défendre leurs intérêts et ceux de l'Europe. Mais, comme cette
déclaration serait dans ce moment prématurée, je demande à Votre
Majesté la permission de lui en reparler plus tard, si les
circonstances ultérieures me paraissent l'exiger.

  [246] Variante: comme j'en _soumettrai_.

Notre langage commence à faire impression. Je regrette fort qu'un
accident qu'a éprouvé M. de Munster l'ait empêché de se trouver près
de lord Castlereagh, qui a bien besoin de soutien. Il sera, à ce
qu'on nous fait espérer, d'ici à deux jours en état de prendre part
aux affaires.

Nº 2 _ter_--LE ROI LOUIS XVIII AU PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND.

Paris, ce 14 octobre 1814.

Mon cousin,

J'ai reçu vos dépêches du 29 septembre et du 4 octobre. (Il serait bon
à l'avenir de les numéroter comme je fais pour celle-ci; par
conséquent, celles dont j'accuse[247] la réception devront porter les
numéros 2 et 3.)

  [247] Variante: dont j'accuse _ici_.

Je commence par vous dire avec une véritable satisfaction que je suis
parfaitement content de l'attitude que vous avez prise et du langage
que vous avez tenu, tant vis-à-vis des plénipotentiaires, que dans
votre pénible conférence avec l'empereur de Russie. Vous savez, sans
doute, qu'il a mandé le général Pozzo di Borgo. Dieu veuille que cet
esprit sage ramène son souverain à des vues plus sensées; mais c'est
dans l'hypothèse contraire qu'il faut raisonner.

Empêcher le succès des projets ambitieux de la Russie et de la Prusse
est le but auquel nous devons tendre. Buonaparte[248] eût peut-être pu
y réussir à lui tout seul; mais il avait des moyens qui ne sont et ne
seront jamais les miens; il me faut donc de l'aide. Les petits États
ne sauraient m'en offrir une suffisante, à eux seuls s'entend; il me
faudrait donc celle au moins d'une grande puissance. Nous aurions
l'Autriche et l'Angleterre, si elles entendaient bien leurs intérêts;
mais je crains qu'elles ne soient déjà liées; je crains
particulièrement un système qui prévaut chez beaucoup d'Anglais, et
dont le duc de Wellington semble lui-même imbu, de séparer entièrement
les intérêts de la Grande-Bretagne de ceux du Hanovre. Alors, je ne
puis pas employer la force pour faire triompher le bon droit, mais je
puis toujours refuser d'être garant de l'iniquité; nous verrons si
pour cela on osera m'attaquer.

  [248] Variante: _Pozzo di Borgo_ eût peut-être pu réussir.

Ce que je dis ici ne regarde que la Pologne et la Saxe; car pour
Naples, je m'en tiendrai toujours à la parfaite réponse que vous avez
faite à M. de Humboldt[249].

  [249] Voir la lettre de M. de Talleyrand du 4 octobre, p. 323.

Je mets les choses au pis[250], parce que je trouve que c'est la vraie
façon[251] de raisonner; mais j'espère beaucoup mieux de votre adresse
et de votre fermeté. Sur quoi, je prie Dieu qu'il vous ait, mon
cousin, en sa sainte et digne garde.

LOUIS.

  [250] Variante: au _pire_.

  [251] Variante: que c'est _là_ la vraie façon.

Nº 6 _bis_.--LES AMBASSADEURS DU ROI AU CONGRÈS, AU MINISTRE DES
AFFAIRES ÉTRANGÈRES A PARIS.

Vienne, le 16 octobre 1814.

Monsieur le comte,

Depuis notre dernière dépêche du 12, aucune conférence n'a eu lieu et
tout le mouvement du congrès se réduit à quelques démarches entre les
puissances et à des intrigues très subalternes qui servent cependant à
faire connaître la situation des esprits, l'exaltation des uns, la
cupidité des autres, l'égarement de tous.

Les grandes difficultés qui s'opposent à la marche des affaires
tiennent à l'idée conçue par l'empereur de Russie de vouloir rétablir
le simulacre d'une Pologne, sous l'influence russe, et d'agrandir la
Prusse par la Saxe. Ce prince, on ose le dire, n'a aucune idée saine à
cet égard et confond à la fois des principes de justice et les
conceptions les plus violentes.

Lord Castlereagh, chez lequel il s'est rendu pour lui insinuer ses
projets à l'égard de la Pologne, les a combattus. Il lui a même remis
un mémoire raisonné dans lequel il place la question telle que nous la
concevons. Il lui démontre que la situation de l'Europe exige ou le
rétablissement de l'ancienne Pologne, ou que cette source de troubles
et de prétentions soit à jamais écartée des discussions en Europe.

Lord Castlereagh a fait lire son mémoire à M. le prince de Talleyrand
et à M. le prince de Metternich, et il seconde sous ce rapport les
véritables intérêts de l'Europe. Mais, tout en combattant les vues
exagérées, il ne conclut rien et paraît même éviter de conclure. Sous
le rapport du roi de Saxe, dont le sort n'est pas discuté, lord
Castlereagh continue à se livrer à l'idée la plus fausse, et, dominé
par la pensée que ce qu'il appelle la trahison du roi de Saxe
servirait d'exemple à l'Allemagne et à l'Europe, il s'intéresse fort
peu à la conservation de cette dynastie et du pays, et il abandonne à
cet égard tous les principes. Les conséquences qu'entraînerait cette
mesure sont trop graves pour que la France puisse y consentir, et nous
espérons que l'Autriche finira par ouvrir les yeux sur ce que lui
dictent l'honneur et son propre intérêt. Nous avons à ce sujet
quelques données qui nous font croire que nos démarches seront
secondées par le cabinet de Vienne; mais elles ne le seront que
lorsque la confiance de ce cabinet dans les dispositions de la France
sera entière.

L'Autriche est liée envers la Prusse par l'engagement qu'on a pris
avec cette dernière puissance de lui procurer une population de dix
millions d'habitants; mais rien n'est stipulé à l'égard de la Saxe, et
l'Autriche voudrait la sauver.

Le prince de Metternich, quoique guidé par une politique timide et
incertaine, juge cependant assez bien l'opinion de son pays et les
intérêts de sa monarchie pour sentir que les États de l'Autriche,
cernés par la Prusse, la Russie et une Pologne toute dans les mains de
la dernière, seraient constamment menacés, et que la France seule peut
l'aider dans cet embarras. La Bavière lui ayant offert des secours, le
prince de Metternich a fait sonder le maréchal de Wrède[252] sur
l'intention de son gouvernement d'entrer dans un concert militaire
avec l'Autriche et la France, pour empêcher l'exécution des projets
sur la Pologne et la Saxe. Le maréchal de Wrède a répondu
affirmativement.

  [252] Charles-Philippe, prince de Wrède, né à Heidelberg en 1767,
  fut de 1805 à 1813 à la tête des troupes bavaroises auxiliaires de
  la France, et fut nommé par Napoléon comte de l'empire. Il fit
  défection en 1813, mais fut écrasé à Hanau. Après la campagne de
  France, il devint feld-maréchal. Il représentait la Bavière au
  congrès de Vienne. Il mourut en 1838.

D'un autre côté, le prince de Metternich conserve de la défiance, non
seulement à l'égard de la volonté du roi pour seconder efficacement le
système de la conservation de la Saxe, mais encore sur les moyens qui
seraient à sa disposition. Cela nous a été confirmé par le propos d'un
homme attaché au prince de Metternich, qui, s'expliquant avec le duc
de Dalberg, lui dit: «Vous nous paraissez comme des chiens qui aboient
fort habilement, mais qui ne mordent pas, et nous ne voulons pas
mordre seuls.» Le même individu lui disait aussi que, si on était sûr
de la fermeté de la France, le langage de l'Autriche pourrait devenir
plus fort et la Russie ne hasarderait pas la guerre. Mais elle
persiste dans ses plans parce qu'elle n'admet pas la possibilité que
l'Autriche et la France combinent une résistance armée contre les
projets soutenus par la Russie et la Prusse à la fois. Le duc de
Dalberg lui répondit que le roi de France ne sanctionnerait jamais un
oubli de toute morale publique, tel que le présenterait
l'anéantissement de la Saxe, et qu'il n'avait pas été le dernier à
ordonner à ses plénipotentiaires de se prononcer en faveur de ce que
dictaient l'honneur et les grands principes de l'ordre public.

L'empereur de Russie n'a fait connaître depuis trois jours aucune
décision; il essaye, avant de prononcer son dernier mot, de gagner les
ministres anglais et autrichiens.

Il se peut qu'il insiste sur le rétablissement de la Pologne, conçu à
sa manière, ou, qu'en y renonçant, il veuille faire valoir ce
sacrifice au delà de ce qui peut être admis par les autres puissances.
Les rapports deviendraient alors difficiles, et il faudrait être prêt
à tous les événements qui pourraient en résulter. Peut-être que
l'Autriche aborderait la question d'une ligue formée par les
puissances du midi contre le nord, et il faudrait être en mesure d'y
répondre.

Nous pensons que la dignité du roi, les intérêts de la France et la
force de l'opinion exigeraient que le roi ne se refusât point à
concourir à la défense des grands principes qui constituent l'ordre en
Europe, et il serait bon et utile qu'il voulût donner les
autorisations nécessaires pour arrêter, si cela devenait urgent, un
accord militaire en opposition avec les projets de la Russie et de la
Prusse.

Nous pensons que lorsque la Russie même serait en état de lever le
bouclier, la Prusse ne voudrait pas se compromettre, et la fermeté de
la France, secondée par l'Autriche comprenant bien son intérêt,
sauverait l'Europe sans troubler la paix.

Il y a une autre considération qui nous détermine à engager le roi à
refuser sa sanction et à faire offrir des secours efficaces pour
empêcher l'anéantissement de la maison de Saxe et la réunion de ce
pays à la Prusse. Cette considération est puisée dans l'esprit
révolutionnaire que nous observons en Allemagne et qui porte un
caractère tout particulier.

Ici, ce n'est point la lutte du tiers état avec les classes
privilégiées, qui fait naître la fermentation. Ce sont les prétentions
et l'amour-propre d'une noblesse militaire et autrefois très
indépendante, qui, préparant le foyer et les éléments d'une
révolution, préférerait obtenir une existence dans un grand État et ne
pas appartenir à des pays morcelés et à des souverains qu'elle regarde
comme ses égaux.

A la tête de ce parti se trouvent tous les princes et nobles
médiatisés; ils cherchent à fondre l'Allemagne en une seule monarchie,
pour y entrer dans le rôle d'une grande représentation aristocratique.
La Prusse, qui a fort habilement flatté tout ce parti, l'a rattaché à
son char, en lui faisant espérer une partie des anciens privilèges
dont il jouissait.

On peut donc être persuadé que si la Prusse parvenait à réunir la Saxe
et à s'approprier de côté et d'autre des territoires isolés, elle
formerait, en peu d'années, une monarchie militaire fort dangereuse
pour ses voisins; et rien, dans cette supposition, ne la servirait
mieux que ce grand nombre de têtes exaltées qui, sous le prétexte de
chercher une patrie, la créeraient par les plus funestes
bouleversements.

Il est du plus grand intérêt d'empêcher ces projets et de seconder
l'Autriche pour pouvoir s'y opposer avec succès. Cette détermination
de la part du roi aidera encore à faire rompre à l'Autriche, à la
Bavière, les liens qui les tiennent attachées à la coalition, et cette
considération est bien importante dans la situation actuelle de la
France.

A l'occasion de la demande que le prince de Metternich a fait faire au
maréchal de Wrède: si la Bavière serait disposée à se liguer avec la
France et l'Autriche, il a été question de la situation militaire des
deux partis, et on est tombé d'accord que la position militaire des
puissances du midi avait un grand avantage sur celle du nord, et
qu'une opération offensive, faite par les débouchés de la Franconie
sur l'Elbe, couperait les armées prussiennes de leur corps sur le Rhin
et d'une grande partie de leurs ressources.

L'Autriche a témoigné de l'inquiétude sur les armées napolitaines et
l'agitation de l'Italie, où elle craint que Bonaparte ne prépare
quelque soulèvement.

Murat avait fait proposer une alliance à la Bavière qui l'a refusée;
mais, si les événements devaient conduire à la guerre, il faudrait
nécessairement porter un corps d'armée en Sicile pour occuper Murat.
L'Espagne devant concourir à cette opération, le corps français
n'aurait pas besoin d'être considérable.

L'Autriche a, dans ce moment, près de trois cent mille hommes sous
les armes; et, d'après des données assez certaines, ces forces sont
distribuées comme il suit:

    Quatre-vingt mille hommes en Bohême;
    Quatre-vingt-dix mille hommes en Moravie et en Hongrie;
    Trente-six mille hommes en Gallicie;
    Vingt mille hommes en Transylvanie;
    Trente mille hommes en Autriche;
    Cinquante mille hommes en Italie.

La Russie peut avoir autant de monde. En voici la distribution:

    Cinquante mille hommes dans le Holstein;
    Quatre-vingt mille hommes en Saxe;
    Cent cinquante mille hommes en Pologne.

La Prusse, cent cinquante mille hommes, dont cinquante mille sur le
bas Rhin, dans le nombre desquels il faut compter quinze mille Saxons.
Leur chef, le général Thielmann[253], a pris parti contre ses anciens
souverains et leur serait infidèle. On ne doit pas compter sur lui.

  [253] Jean-Adolphe, baron de Thielmann, né à Dresde en 1765, prit,
  bien que Saxon, du service dans l'armée prussienne, fit contre la
  France les campagnes de 1792 à 1795, ainsi que celle de 1806. Nommé
  général en 1809, il rentra au service de la Saxe et commanda la
  cavalerie saxonne durant la campagne de Russie. En 1813, il passa
  dans les rangs des alliés et se mit à la tête d'un corps de
  partisans. En 1815, il reprit du service en Prusse et commandait
  une division prussienne à Ligny. Il mourut en 1824.

Ce qui semblerait prouver que l'empereur de Russie ne croit pas
pouvoir terminer les affaires cette année, c'est qu'il a retardé la
ratification du traité avec le Danemark et la Suède[254], dont il
doit être garant et qu'il n'a point donné d'ordres pour retirer son
armée qui occupe et dévore le Holstein. Le roi de Danemark n'a pu rien
obtenir à cet égard.

Agréez...

  [254] Traité de paix entre la Russie et le Danemark, signé à
  Hanovre le 8 février 1814. L'article VI de ce traité décidait que
  les troupes russes ne pourraient frapper le Holstein d'aucune
  contribution.

Nº 6.--LE PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND AU ROI LOUIS XVIII.

Vienne, le 17 octobre 1814.

SIRE,

J'ai reçu la lettre dont Votre Majesté a daigné m'honorer. Je suis
heureux de trouver que la ligne de conduite que j'ai suivie s'accorde
avec les intentions que Votre Majesté veut bien m'exprimer. Je mettrai
tous mes soins à ne m'en écarter jamais.

J'ai à rendre compte à Votre Majesté de la situation des choses depuis
ma dernière lettre.

Lord Castlereagh, voulant faire une nouvelle tentative sur l'esprit de
l'empereur Alexandre pour lui faire abandonner ses idées de Pologne
qui dérangent tout et mènent à tout bouleverser, lui avait demandé une
audience. L'empereur a voulu y mettre une sorte de mystère et lui a
fait l'honneur de se rendre chez lui; et sachant bien de quel sujet
lord Castlereagh avait à l'entretenir, il est de lui-même entré en
matière, en se plaignant de l'opposition qu'il trouvait à ses vues. Il
ne comprenait pas, il ne comprendrait jamais que la France et
l'Angleterre pussent être opposées au rétablissement d'un royaume de
Pologne[255]. Ce rétablissement, disait-il, serait une réparation
faite à la morale publique que le partage avait outragée, une sorte
d'expiation. A la vérité, il ne s'agissait pas de rétablir la Pologne
entière; mais rien n'empêcherait que cela se fît[256] un jour, si
l'Europe le désirait. Pour le moment la chose serait prématurée; le
pays lui-même avait besoin d'y être préparé; il ne pouvait l'être
mieux que par le rétablissement en royaume d'une partie seulement de
la Pologne, à laquelle on donnerait des institutions propres à y faire
germer et fructifier tous les principes de la civilisation, qui se
répandraient ensuite dans la masse entière, lorsqu'il aurait été jugé
convenable de la réunir. L'exécution de son plan ne devait coûter de
sacrifices qu'à lui, puisque le nouveau royaume ne serait formé que de
parties de la Pologne sur lesquelles la conquête lui donnait
d'incontestables droits, et auxquelles il ajouterait encore celles
qu'il avait acquises antérieurement à la dernière guerre et depuis le
partage (Byalistock et Tarnopol). Personne n'avait donc à se plaindre
de ce qu'il voulait[257] faire ces sacrifices; il les ferait avec
plaisir, par principe de conscience, pour consoler une nation
malheureuse, pour avancer la civilisation; il attachait à cela son
honneur et sa gloire. Lord Castlereagh, qui avait ses raisonnements
préparés, les a déduits dans une conversation qui a été fort longue,
mais sans persuader ni convaincre l'empereur Alexandre, lequel s'est
retiré en laissant lord Castlereagh fort peu satisfait de ses
dispositions; mais comme il ne se tenait point pour battu, il a mis
ses raisons par écrit, et, le soir même, il les a présentées à
l'empereur sous le titre de _memorandum_.

  [255] Variante: _du_ royaume de Pologne.

  [256] Variante: que cela _ne_ se fît.

  [257] Variante: de ce qu'il _voulût_.

Après m'avoir donné, dans une conversation fort longue, les détails
qui précèdent, lord Castlereagh m'a fait lire cette pièce, ce dont,
pour le dire en passant, M. de Metternich qui l'a su a témoigné une
surprise qu'il n'aurait pas montrée s'il n'était pas en général
convenu entre les ministres des quatre cours de ne point communiquer à
d'autres ce qu'ils font entre eux.

Le _memorandum_ commence par citer les articles des traités conclus en
1813 par les alliés, lesquels portent que: _la Pologne restera
partagée entre les trois puissances dans des proportions dont elles
conviendront à l'amiable; et sans que la France puisse s'en mêler._
(Lord Castlereagh s'est hâté de me dire qu'il s'agissait de la France
de 1813, et non de la France d'aujourd'hui.) Il rapporte ensuite
textuellement des discours tenus, des promesses faites, des assurances
données par l'empereur Alexandre à diverses époques, en divers lieux,
et notamment à Paris, et qui sont en opposition avec le plan qu'il
poursuit maintenant.

A cela succède un exposé des services rendus par l'Angleterre à
l'empereur Alexandre.

Pour lui assurer la possession tranquille de la Finlande, elle a
concouru[258] à faire passer la Norvège sous la domination de la
Suède[259], faisant en cela le sacrifice de son propre penchant, et
peut-être même de ses intérêts. Par sa médiation elle lui a fait
obtenir de la Porte ottomane des cessions et d'autres avantages[260];
et de la Perse, la cession d'un territoire assez considérable[261].
Elle se croit donc en droit de parler à l'empereur Alexandre avec plus
de franchise que les autres puissances, qui n'ont point été dans le
cas de lui rendre les mêmes services.

  [258] Variante: elle a _commencé_.

  [259] La Norvège, avant 1814, appartenait au Danemark. Or, le
  Danemark avait conclu en 1813 une alliance avec Napoléon, au lieu
  que la Suède avait pris le parti des alliés, et avait signé avec
  l'Angleterre un traité de subside (3 mars 1813). La Suède envahit
  la Norvège. Le traité du 14 août 1814 suspendit les hostilités, et
  le 4 novembre suivant, la diète norvégienne proclama le roi de
  Suède, roi de Norvège.

  [260] Paix de Bucharest en 1812, par laquelle la Turquie cédait à
  la Russie la Bessarabie et une partie de la Moldavie, et
  reconnaissait le protectorat russe sur la Valachie.

  [261] Traité de paix entre la Russie et la Perse (12 octobre 1813).

De là, passant à l'examen du plan actuel de l'empereur, lord
Castlereagh déclare que le rétablissement de la Pologne entière en un
État complètement indépendant obtiendrait l'assentiment de tout le
monde; mais que créer un royaume avec le quart de la Pologne, ce
serait créer des regrets pour les trois autres quarts et de justes
inquiétudes pour ceux qui en possèdent une partie quelconque, et qui,
du moment où il existerait un royaume de Pologne, ne pourraient plus
compter un seul instant sur la fidélité de leurs sujets; qu'ainsi, au
lieu d'un foyer de civilisation, on n'aurait établi qu'un foyer
d'insurrections et de troubles, quand le repos est le voeu comme il est
le besoin de tous. En convenant que la conquête a donné des droits à
l'empereur, il soutient que ces droits ont pour limites le point qu'il
ne saurait dépasser sans nuire à la sécurité de ses voisins. Il le
conjure par tout ce qu'il a de cher, par son humanité, par sa gloire,
de ne point vouloir aller au delà, et il finit par lui dire qu'il le
prie d'autant plus instamment de peser toutes les réflexions qu'il lui
soumet, que, dans le cas où il persisterait dans ses vues,
l'Angleterre aurait le regret de n'y pouvoir donner son consentement.

L'empereur Alexandre n'a point encore répondu.

Autant lord Castlereagh est bien dans la question de la Pologne,
autant il est mal dans celle de la Saxe. Il ne parle que de trahison,
de la nécessité d'un exemple. Les principes ne paraissent[262] pas
être son côté fort. Le comte de Munster, dont la santé est meilleure,
a essayé de le convaincre que de la conservation de la Saxe dépendait
l'équilibre, et même, peut-être, l'existence de l'Allemagne; et il a
tout au plus réussi à lui donner des doutes. Cependant il m'a promis,
non pas de se prononcer comme nous dans cette question, (il paraît
avoir à cet égard avec les Prussiens des engagements qui le lient),
mais de faire, dans notre sens, des représentations amicales.

  [262] Variante: _n'apparaissent_ pas.

Sa démarche vis-à-vis de l'empereur Alexandre a été, non seulement
faite de l'aveu, mais même à la prière de M. de Metternich. Je n'en
saurais douter, quoique ni l'un ni l'autre ne me l'aient dit.
L'Autriche sent toutes les conséquences des projets russes, mais,
n'osant se mettre en avant, elle y fait mettre[263] l'Angleterre.

  [263] Variante: elle y _a_ fait mettre.

Si l'empereur Alexandre persiste, l'Autriche, trop intéressée à ne pas
céder, ne cédera pas, je le crois; mais sa timidité la portera à
traîner les choses en longueur. Cependant, ce parti a des dangers qui
chaque jour deviennent plus grands, qui pourraient devenir extrêmes,
et sur lesquels je dois d'autant plus appeler l'attention de Votre
Majesté, que leur cause pourrait se prolonger fort au delà du temps
présent, de manière à devoir exciter toute sa sollicitude pendant
toute la durée de son règne.

Des ferments révolutionnaires sont partout répandus en Allemagne. Le
jacobinisme y domine, non point comme en France, il y a vingt-cinq
ans, dans les classes moyennes et inférieures, mais parmi la plus
haute et la plus riche noblesse; différence qui fait que la marche
d'une révolution qui viendrait à y éclater ne pourrait pas être
calculée d'après la marche de la nôtre. Ceux que la dissolution de
l'empire germanique et l'acte de confédération du Rhin ont fait
descendre du rang de dynastes à la condition de sujets supportant[264]
impatiemment d'avoir pour maîtres ceux dont ils étaient ou croyaient
être les égaux, aspirent à renverser un ordre de choses dont leur
orgueil s'indigne, et à remplacer tous les gouvernements de ce pays
par un seul. Avec eux conspirent les hommes des universités, et la
jeunesse imbue de leurs théories, et ceux qui attribuent à la division
de l'Allemagne en petits États les calamités versées sur elle par tant
de guerres dont elle est le continuel théâtre. L'unité de la patrie
allemande est leur cri, leur dogme, leur religion exaltée jusqu'au
fanatisme, et ce fanatisme a gagné même des princes actuellement
régnants. Or, cette unité, dont la France pouvait n'avoir rien à
craindre quand elle possédait la rive gauche du Rhin et la Belgique,
serait maintenant pour elle d'une très grande conséquence. Qui peut
d'ailleurs prévoir les suites de l'ébranlement d'une masse telle que
l'Allemagne, lorsque ses éléments divisés viendraient à s'agiter et à
se confondre? Qui sait où s'arrêterait l'impulsion une fois donnée?
La situation de l'Allemagne, dont une grande partie ne sait pas qui
elle doit avoir pour maître, les occupations militaires, les vexations
qui en sont le cortège ordinaire, de nouveaux sacrifices demandés
après tant de sacrifices, le mal-être présent, l'incertitude de
l'avenir, tout favorise les projets de bouleversement. Il est trop
évident que si le congrès s'ajourne, s'il diffère, s'il ne décide
rien, il aggravera cet état de choses, et il est trop à craindre qu'en
l'aggravant, il n'amène une explosion. L'intérêt le plus pressant
serait donc qu'il accélérât ses travaux, et qu'il finît; mais comment
finir? En cédant à ce que veulent les Russes et les Prussiens? Ni la
sûreté de l'Europe ni l'honneur ne le permettent. En opposant la force
à la force? Il faudrait pour cela que l'Autriche, qui en a, je crois,
le désir, en eût la volonté. Elle a sur pied des forces immenses; mais
elle craint des soulèvements en Italie, et n'ose se commettre seule
avec la Russie et la Prusse. Elle peut compter sur la Bavière, qui
s'est prononcée très franchement et lui a offert cinquante mille
hommes pour défendre la Saxe: le Wurtemberg lui en fournirait dix
mille: d'autres États allemands se joindraient à elle; mais cela ne la
rassure point assez. Elle voudrait pouvoir compter sur notre concours,
et ne croit pas pouvoir y compter. Les Prussiens ont répandu le bruit
que les ministres de Votre Majesté avaient reçu de doubles
instructions qui leur prescrivaient, les unes le langage qu'ils
devaient tenir, et les autres de ne rien promettre. M. de Metternich a
fait dire au maréchal de Wrède qu'il le croyait ainsi. Une personne de
sa plus intime confiance disait, il y a peu de jours, à M. de Dalberg:
«Votre légation parle très habilement mais vous ne voulez point agir,
et nous, nous ne voulons point agir seuls.»

  [264] Variante: _supportent_.

Votre Majesté croira sans peine que je n'aime pas plus la guerre et
que je ne la désire pas plus qu'elle. Mais, dans mon opinion, il
suffirait de la montrer, et l'on n'aurait pas besoin de la faire. Dans
mon opinion encore, la crainte de la guerre ne doit pas l'emporter sur
celle d'un mal plus grand, que la guerre seule peut prévenir.

Je ne puis croire que la Russie et la Prusse voulussent courir les
chances d'une guerre contre l'Autriche, la France, la Sardaigne, la
Bavière et une bonne partie de l'Allemagne; ou si elles voulaient
courir cette chance, à plus forte raison ne reculeraient-elles point
devant l'Autriche seule, en supposant, ce qui n'est pas, qu'elle
voulût engager seule la lutte.

Ainsi, l'Autriche privée de notre appui n'aurait d'autre ressource que
de prolonger indéfiniment le congrès ou de le dissoudre, ce qui
ouvrirait la porte aux révolutions; ou de céder et de consentir à des
choses que Votre Majesté est résolue à ne jamais sanctionner.

Dans ce cas, il ne resterait aux ministres de Votre Majesté qu'à se
retirer du congrès en renonçant à rien obtenir de ce qu'elle désire le
plus. Cependant l'état des choses qui se trouverait établi en Europe
pourrait rendre inévitable, dans très peu d'années, la guerre que l'on
aurait voulu éviter, et l'on pourrait alors se trouver dans une
situation où l'on aurait moins de moyens de la faire.

Je crois non seulement possible, mais encore probable, que si la
réponse de l'empereur Alexandre ôte toute espérance de le voir céder à
la persuasion, le prince de Metternich me demandera si et jusqu'à
quel point l'Autriche peut compter sur notre coopération.

Les instructions qui nous ont été données par Votre Majesté portent
que la domination de la Russie sur toute la Pologne menacerait
l'Europe d'un danger si grand que, s'il ne pouvait être écarté que par
la force des armes, il ne faudrait point balancer un seul moment à les
prendre, ce qui semblerait m'autoriser à promettre en général, pour ce
cas, les secours de Votre Majesté.

Mais, pour répondre d'une manière positive à une demande précise, pour
promettre des secours déterminés, j'ai besoin d'une autorisation et
d'instructions spéciales. J'ose supplier Votre Majesté de vouloir bien
me les donner, et d'être persuadée que je n'en ferai usage que dans le
cas d'une évidente et extrême nécessité. Mais je persiste à croire que
le cas que je prévois ne se présentera pas.

Toutefois, pour être préparé à tout, je désirerais que Votre Majesté
daignât m'honorer le plus promptement possible de ses ordres.

Depuis la déclaration que j'ai eu l'honneur d'envoyer à Votre Majesté,
les ministres des huit puissances ne se sont point réunis.

Un comité, composé d'un ministre d'Autriche, d'un Prussien et des
ministres de Bavière, de Wurtemberg et de Hanovre, travaille à la
constitution fédérale de l'Allemagne. Ils ont déjà tenu une
conférence. On doute que, vu la diversité des intérêts de ceux qu'ils
représentent, et de leurs propres caractères, ils parviennent à
s'accorder.

Je suis, etc.

Nº 7.--LE PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND AU ROI LOUIS XVIII.

Vienne, le 19 octobre 1814.

SIRE,

M. de Labrador, pour avoir été de la même opinion que moi dans les
conférences auxquelles nous avons été l'un et l'autre appelés, et
peut-être aussi pour être venu assez souvent chez moi, où lord
Castlereagh l'a trouvé une fois, a essuyé les plus vifs reproches de
la part des ministres des quatre cours. On l'a traité de transfuge,
d'homme qui se séparait de ceux auxquels l'Espagne était redevable de
sa délivrance, et, ce qui est digne de remarque, M. de Metternich est
celui qui a montré sur ce point le plus de chaleur. M. de Labrador
n'en a pas pour cela changé d'opinion, mais il s'est cru obligé de
rendre les visites qu'il me fait plus rares. On peut juger par là
jusqu'à quel point les ministres moins indépendants par leur position
ou leur caractère personnel sont ou peuvent se croire libres d'avoir
des rapports suivis avec la légation de Votre Majesté.

Les cinq ministres qui ont été réunis pour s'occuper du projet de
constitution fédérale ont été requis de donner leur parole d'honneur
de ne communiquer à qui que ce soit les propositions qui leur seraient
faites. C'est surtout contre la légation de France que cette
précaution assez inutile a été prise. N'ayant pu lui faire accepter
dans les négociations le rôle qu'on a essayé de lui faire prendre, on
veut l'isoler.

Cependant, à travers les ténèbres dont on veut l'environner et que
l'on s'efforce, à mesure que le temps avance, de rendre plus épaisses,
un rayon de lumière a percé[265]. Peut-être tenons-nous le fil qui
peut nous faire pénétrer dans le labyrinthe d'intrigues où l'on avait
espéré d'abord de nous égarer. Voici ce que nous avons appris d'un
homme que sa position met éminemment en mesure d'être bien informé.

  [265] Variante: a _paru_.

Les quatre cours n'ont point cessé d'être alliées en ce sens que les
sentiments avec lesquels elles ont fait la guerre lui ont survécu, et
que l'esprit avec lequel elles ont combattu est le même qu'elles
portent dans les arrangements de l'Europe. Leur projet était de faire
ces arrangements seules. Puis, elles ont senti que l'unique moyen de
les faire considérer comme légitimes était de les faire revêtir d'une
apparente sanction. Voilà pourquoi le congrès a été convoqué. Elles
auraient désiré d'en exclure la France, mais elles ne le pouvaient pas
après l'heureux changement qui s'y était opéré, et sous ce rapport, ce
changement les a contrariées. Cependant, elles se sont flattées que la
France, longtemps et uniquement occupée de ses embarras intérieurs,
n'interviendrait au congrès que pour la forme. Voyant qu'elle s'y
présentait avec des principes qu'elles ne pouvaient point[266]
combattre, et qu'elles ne voulaient pas suivre, elles ont pris le
parti de l'écarter de fait, sans l'exclure, et de concentrer tout
entre leurs mains, pour marcher sans obstacle à l'exécution de leur
plan. Ce plan n'est au fond que celui de l'Angleterre. C'est elle qui
est l'âme de tout. Son peu de zèle pour les principes ne doit pas
surprendre: ses principes sont son intérêt. Son but est simple: elle
veut conserver sa prépondérance maritime, et, avec cette
prépondérance, le commerce du monde. Pour cela, elle a besoin que la
marine française ne lui devienne jamais redoutable, ni combinée avec
d'autres, ni seule. Déjà elle a pris soin d'isoler la France des
autres puissances maritimes par les engagements qu'elle leur a fait
prendre. Le rétablissement de la maison de Bourbon lui ayant fait
craindre le renouvellement du pacte de famille, elle s'est hâtée de
conclure avec l'Espagne le traité du 5 juillet, lequel porte que ce
pacte ne sera jamais renouvelé. Il lui reste de placer la France,
comme puissance continentale, dans une situation qui ne lui
permette[267] de vouer qu'une petite partie de ses forces au service
de mer. Dans cette vue, elle veut unir étroitement l'Autriche et la
Prusse en rendant celle-ci aussi forte que possible[268], et les
opposer toutes deux comme rivales à la France. C'est par suite de ce
plan que lord Stewart a été nommé ambassadeur à Vienne. Il est tout
Prussien; c'est là ce qui l'a l'ait choisir. On tâchera de placer de
même à Berlin un homme qui soit lié d'inclination à l'Autriche. Rien
ne convient mieux aux desseins de rendre la Prusse forte, que de lui
donner la Saxe; l'Angleterre veut donc qu'on sacrifie ce pays et qu'on
le donne à la Prusse. Lord Castlereagh et M. Cook[269] sont si
déterminés dans cette question, qu'ils osent dire que le sacrifice de
la Saxe, sans aucune abdication, sans aucune cession du roi, ne
blesse aucun principe. Naturellement l'Autriche devrait repousser
cette doctrine. La justice, la bienséance, sa sûreté même, tout l'en
presse. Qu'a-t-on fait pour vaincre sa résistance? Rien que de très
simple: on l'a placée vis-à-vis de deux difficultés en l'aidant à
surmonter l'une, à condition qu'elle cédera[270] sur l'autre.
L'empereur de Russie est là fort à propos avec le désir d'avoir le
duché de Varsovie entier, et de former[271] un simulacre de royaume de
Pologne. Lord Castlereagh s'y oppose et dresse un mémoire qu'il
montrera à son parlement, pour faire croire qu'il a eu tant de peine à
arranger les affaires de Pologne, qu'on ne saurait lui imputer à blâme
de n'avoir pas sauvé la Saxe, et, pour prix de ses efforts, il presse
l'Autriche de consentir à la disparition de ce royaume. Qui sait si le
désir de former un simulacre de Pologne n'a pas été suggéré à
l'empereur Alexandre par ceux mêmes qui le combattent, ou si ce désir
est sincère? si l'empereur, pour se rendre agréable aux Polonais, ne
leur a pas fait des promesses qu'il serait très fâché de tenir? si la
résistance qu'on lui oppose n'est pas ce qu'il souhaite le plus, et si
on ne le mettrait pas dans le plus grand embarras en consentant à ce
qu'il parait vouloir? Cependant M. de Metternich, qui se pique de
donner à tout l'impulsion, la reçoit lui-même, sans s'en douter, et,
jouet des intrigues qu'il croit mener, il se laisse tromper comme un
enfant.

  [266] Variante: qu'elles ne _pourraient pas_.

  [267] Variante: qui ne lui _permettra_.

  [268] Variante: _qu'il est_ possible.

  [269] Édouard Cook ou Cooke, homme d'État anglais, fut d'abord
  premier greffier de la Chambre des communes d'Irlande, puis
  secrétaire du département de la guerre dans ce pays, et député. Il
  contribua par ses écrits à la réunion des parlements d'Angleterre
  et d'Irlande, fut ensuite nommé par lord Castlereagh
  sous-secrétaire d'État de l'intérieur et des affaires étrangères,
  et l'accompagna comme plénipotentiaire au congrès de Vienne. Il se
  retira en 1817 et mourut en 1820.

  [270] Variante: qu'elle _céderait_.

  [271] Variante: et de _servir_.

Sans assurer que toutes ces informations soient parfaitement exactes,
je dois dire qu'elles me paraissent extrêmement vraisemblables.

Il y a peu de jours que M. de Metternich réunit près de lui un certain
nombre de personnes qu'il est dans l'habitude de consulter. Toutes
furent d'avis que la Saxe ne devait point être abandonnée. Rien ne fut
conclu, et, avant-hier soir, j'appris par une voix sûre que M. de
Metternich, personnellement abandonnait la Saxe, mais que l'empereur
d'Autriche luttait encore.

L'un des commissaires pour le projet de constitution fédérale a dit
que les propositions qui leur étaient faites supposaient que la Saxe
ne devait plus exister.

La journée d'hier fut consacrée tout entière à deux fêtes: l'une
militaire et commémorative de la bataille de Leipsick: la légation de
Votre Majesté n'y pouvait pas être; j'assistai à l'autre, donnée par
le prince de Metternich, en l'honneur de la paix. Je désirais pouvoir
y trouver l'occasion de dire un mot à l'empereur d'Autriche. Je ne fus
point assez heureux (je l'avais été davantage au bal précédent, où
j'avais pu placer vis-à-vis de lui quelques mots sur les circonstances
et de nature à produire quelque effet sur son esprit; il parut alors
me très bien comprendre.) Lord Castlereagh lui parla près de vingt
minutes, et il m'est revenu que la Saxe avait été le sujet de cette
conversation.

La disposition qui donnerait ce pays à la Prusse serait regardée en
Autriche, même par les hommes du cabinet, comme un malheur pour la
monarchie autrichienne, et en Allemagne comme une calamité. On l'y
regarderait comme destinant infailliblement l'Allemagne même à être
partagée plus tôt ou plus tard, comme l'a été la Pologne.

Le roi de Bavière ordonnait encore hier à son ministre de faire de
nouvelles démarches pour la Saxe et lui disait: «Ce projet est de
toute injustice et m'ôte tout repos.»

Si l'Autriche veut conserver la Saxe, il est probable qu'elle voudra à
tout événement s'assurer de notre coopération et c'est pour être prêt
à répondre à toute demande de cette nature que j'ai supplié Votre
Majesté de m'honorer de ses ordres. Toutefois, comme j'ai eu l'honneur
de le lui dire, je tiens pour certain que la Russie et la Prusse
n'engageraient point la lutte.

Si l'Autriche cédait sans avoir demandé notre concours, c'est qu'elle
serait décidée à n'en pas vouloir. Elle ôterait par là, à Votre
Majesté, toute espérance de sauver la Saxe, mais elle ne saurait lui
ôter la gloire de défendre les principes qui font la sûreté de tous
les trônes.

Au surplus, tant que l'Autriche n'aura pas définitivement cédé, je ne
désespérerai pas, et je crois même avoir trouvé un moyen, sinon
d'empêcher que la Saxe ne soit sacrifiée, du moins d'embarrasser ceux
qui la veulent sacrifier: c'est de faire connaître à l'empereur de
Russie que nous ne nous opposons point à ce qu'il possède, sous
quelque dénomination [272] que ce soit, la partie de la Pologne qui
lui sera [273] dévolue, et qui n'étendrait point ses frontières de
manière à inquiéter ses voisins, pourvu qu'en même temps la Saxe soit
[274] conservée.

  [272] Variante: sous quelque _domination_.

  [273] Variante: qui lui _serait_ dévolue.

  [274] Variante: _et pourvu en même temps que la Saxe fût_.

Si l'empereur n'a réellement point envie de faire un royaume de
Pologne, et qu'il ne cherche qu'une excuse à donner aux Polonais,
cette déclaration le gênera. Il ne pourra pas dire aux Polonais, et
ceux-ci ne pourront pas croire que c'est la France qui s'oppose à
l'accomplissement de leur voeu le plus cher. De son côté, lord
Castlereagh sera embarrassé d'expliquer au parlement comment il s'est
opposé à une chose que beaucoup de personnes désirent en Angleterre,
quand la France ne s'y opposait pas.

Que si l'empereur Alexandre tient véritablement à l'idée de ce royaume
de Pologne, le consentement de la France sera pour lui une raison d'y
persister; l'Autriche, rejetée par là dans l'embarras d'où elle aurait
cru se tirer par l'abandon de la Saxe, reviendra forcément sur cet
abandon et sera ramenée à nous.

Dans aucune hypothèse, cette déclaration ne peut nous nuire. Ce qui
nous importe, c'est que la Russie ait le moins de Pologne qu'il est
possible et que la Saxe soit sauvée. Il nous importe moins, ou même,
il ne nous importe pas que la Russie possède d'une manière ou d'une
autre ce qui doit être à elle et qu'elle doit posséder. C'est à
l'Autriche que cela importe. Or, quand elle sacrifie sans nécessité ce
qu'elle sait nous intéresser et ce qui doit l'intéresser davantage
elle-même, pourquoi hésiterions-nous à la replacer dans la situation
d'où elle a voulu se tirer, surtout lorsqu'il dépend d'elle de finir à
la fois ses embarras et les nôtres, et qu'elle n'a besoin pour cela
que de s'unir à nous?

Je suis informé que l'empereur Alexandre a exprimé ces jours derniers,
et à plusieurs reprises, l'intention de me faire appeler. S'il le
fait, je tenterai le moyen dont je viens d'avoir l'honneur
d'entretenir Votre Majesté.

Le général Pozzo, qui est ici depuis quelques jours, parle de la
France de la manière la plus convenable.

L'électeur de Hanovre ne pouvant plus conserver ce titre, puisqu'il ne
doit plus y avoir d'empire germanique ni d'empereur électif, et ne
voulant point être dans un rang inférieur à celui du souverain du
Wurtemberg, sur lequel il l'emportait autrefois de beaucoup, a pris le
titre de roi. Le comte de Munster (qui est à peu près guéri de sa
chute) me l'a notifié. J'attends pour lui répondre et reconnaître le
nouveau titre[275] que son maître a pris, l'autorisation que Votre
Majesté jugera sans doute convenable de me donner.

Nº 7 bis.--LES AMBASSADEURS DU ROI AU CONGRÈS, AU MINISTRE DES
AFFAIRES ÉTRANGÈRES, A PARIS.

Vienne, le 20 octobre 1814.

Monsieur le comte,

Dans une de nos précédentes dépêches, nous avons eu l'honneur de vous
mander que les quatre puissances alliées, conformément à leurs
arrangements, continuent à suivre un système de convenance arrêté pour
le cas où Bonaparte serait resté sur le trône de France; qu'elles ne
comptent pour rien le rétablissement de la maison de Bourbon, qui
change l'état de l'Europe et qui aurait dû faire retourner tout dans
le système existant en 1792. Mais comme la force de la France les
épouvante encore, c'est avec un singulier aveuglement que le prince de
Metternich continue à seconder les projets des trois puissances, qu'il
facilite à la Russie les moyens de s'emparer du duché de Varsovie, à
la Prusse d'occuper la Saxe, et à l'Angleterre d'exercer l'influence
la plus absolue sur ce qu'on appelait, et sur ce qu'on peut encore
appeler la coalition. Cet état de choses produit un effet très
étrange; tout ce qui tient à la monarchie autrichienne s'approche de
nous, tout ce qui tient au ministère s'éloigne.

Il n'y a plus eu de conférence depuis celle dont nous avons eu
l'honneur de vous entretenir. Les ministres des quatre puissances se
voient, parlent, projettent, changent, et rien ne finit. Cependant le
moment d'une décision approche. Nous sommes au courant de tous ces
petits mouvements politiques, quoiqu'ils se soient donné leur parole
d'honneur de ne nous instruire de rien de ce qu'ils méditent.

Le système des puissances naît de l'effroi dans lequel elles sont
encore. Elles veulent exécuter l'engagement pris le 13 juin 1813, de
finir les affaires de Pologne, sans que la France puisse y intervenir.
Elles tendent enfin à isoler la France, et se repentent de la paix
qu'elles ont signée.

Le système anglais se présente ici partout avec évidence. Alarmés
encore de l'effet qu'a produit sur l'Angleterre le système
continental, les ministres anglais veulent que dans le nord et sur la
Baltique, il y ait des puissances assez fortes pour que la France ne
puisse, à aucune époque, entraver le commerce de l'Angleterre avec
l'intérieur du continent. Ils se prêtent par cette raison à tout ce
que la Prusse exige, et soutiennent ses prétentions par tous leurs
efforts.

C'est de cette combinaison que résulta l'agrandissement de la Hollande
par les Pays-Bas, du Hanovre et de la Prusse. C'est dans ce même
esprit que l'Angleterre a exigé que l'Espagne ne renouvelât point les
stipulations du pacte de famille. Elle a craint que le roi n'ajoutât
par ce système d'alliance une nouvelle force à celle que possède la
France. Le voyage empressé de lord Wellington de Paris à Madrid a eu
cette négociation pour objet.

Lord Castlereagh prouve au surplus par cette même combinaison qu'il ne
sait juger ni la situation du continent ni celle de la France, et
qu'il ne voit pas que l'un et l'autre ont été victimes de ce système
et le craindraient plus que l'Angleterre même.

Dans cet état de choses, placés entre les passions d'une part, et
l'ambition des puissances de l'autre, les ministres du roi ont à
soutenir avec la plus grande fermeté les principes conservateurs du
droit des gens, à ne condescendre à aucune complaisance qui renverse
ces principes, à opposer toute la dignité et le calme possibles à cet
égarement, et attendre enfin que la raison et le temps éclairent les
différentes puissances sur leurs véritables intérêts.

Au bal qu'a donné hier soir le prince de Metternich, le comte de
Schulenburg s'est approché du maréchal de Wrède et lui a demandé ce
qu'il pourrait lui dire à l'égard de la Saxe? Celui-ci lui a répondu:
«Approchez-vous du maître de la maison, et voyez s'il ose lever les
yeux sur vous.»

Le roi de Bavière à ce même bal a demandé à M. de Labrador s'il voyait
quelquefois le prince de Talleyrand? L'ambassadeur d'Espagne a dit que
oui: «Je le voudrais bien aussi, dit le roi, mais je n'ose pas. Je
vous fais au reste ma profession de foi: je suis très dévoué à la
maison de Bourbon.»

Nous attendons que ces dispositions nous parviennent officiellement
pour nous expliquer, et nous ne manquerons, en attendant, aucune
occasion de répéter que cet oubli de toute mesure prolonge la
Révolution et doit nécessairement conduire à de nouvelles agitations.
Le temps nous éclairera sur les dernières déterminations que nous
aurons à prendre.

Le roi doit être bien convaincu que le système qu'il a adopté, qu'il
nous a tracé dans ses instructions et dont nous ne nous écartons en
rien, lui assure la considération et la reconnaissance de tous ceux
qui ne sont pas aveuglés par les passions et le plus funeste délire.

Nº 3 _ter_.--LE ROI LOUIS XVIII AU PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND.

Paris, le 21 octobre 1814.

Mon cousin,

J'ai reçu vos numéros 4 et 5.

La preuve la plus certaine que votre note du 1er octobre était bonne,
c'est qu'elle a déplu aux plénipotentiaires des cours ci-devant
alliées, et qu'en même temps elle les a forcés de revenir _un
peu_[276] sur leurs pas; mais ne nous endormons pas sur ce succès.
L'existence de la ligue dont vous me parlez dans le numéro 4 est
démontrée à mes yeux, et surtout le projet de se venger sur la France,
_ut sic_, des humiliations que le directoire et bien davantage
Buonaparte[277] ont fait subir à l'Europe. Jamais je ne me laisserai
réduire là; aussi j'adopte très fort l'idée de la déclaration et je
désire que vous m'en envoyiez[278] le projet plus tôt que plus tard.
Mais ce n'est pas tout[279]; il faut prouver _qu'il y a quelque chose
derrière_, et, pour cela, il me paraît nécessaire de faire des
préparatifs pour porter au besoin l'armée sur un pied plus
considérable que celui où elle est maintenant.

Je vous ferai incessamment écrire par M. de Jaucourt la lettre que

exécution.

L'infortuné Gustave IV[284] m'a annoncé son intention de venir ici
sous peu de jours. Si l'on en parle à Vienne, vous pouvez hardiment
affirmer que ce voyage ne cache aucune stipulation politique, mais
que jamais ma porte ne sera fermée à qui m'ouvrit toujours la sienne.

  [284] Gustave IV, roi de Suède, fils de Gustave III, né en 1778,
  succéda à son père en 1792 sous la tutelle de son oncle le duc de
  Sudermanie. Battu par la Russie et par la France, ayant mécontenté
  la noblesse et le peuple, il suscita contre lui un soulèvement et
  abdiqua en 1809. La diète l'exila à perpétuité et proclama roi le
  duc de Sudermanie sous le nom de Charles XIII. Quant au roi
  Gustave, il vécut désormais à l'étranger sous le nom de colonel
  Gustavson, et mourut en 1837.

Nº 8 _bis_.--LES AMBASSADEURS DU ROI AU CONGRÈS, AU MINISTRE DES
AFFAIRES ÉTRANGÈRES A PARIS.

Vienne, le 24 octobre 1814.

Monsieur le comte,

Les affaires n'ont pas pris une meilleure direction. Tout, depuis
notre dernière dépêche, est intrigue, mystère et incohérence dans le
système général.

L'empereur de Russie persiste dans l'occupation du grand-duché de
Varsovie. Il ne veut en céder que quelques parcelles et prétend y
régénérer la Pologne.

La Prusse persiste à s'indemniser de ses pertes par la réunion de la
Saxe. L'empereur de Russie annonce y avoir consenti; il déclare qu'il
en a pris l'engagement personnel envers le roi de Prusse.

L'Autriche ne s'y oppose que faiblement; elle louvoie, cherche à
gagner du temps, à se fortifier de l'impression que cet acte
d'injustice produit sur les esprits. Elle ne se rapproche pas de nous
et croit la question perdue, tout en voulant la rattacher à la
discussion qui doit avoir lieu sur les limites en Pologne.

L'Angleterre n'a de bonne foi que pour faire obtenir à la Prusse tout
ce que cette puissance exige. Celle-ci doit devenir le garant des
relations anglaises en Allemagne qui tendent à une union intime entre
l'Autriche et la Prusse. L'Angleterre y rattache le Hanovre et la
Hollande.

Le 1er novembre approche, et on ne se sera entendu sur rien. Aucune
conférence n'a eu lieu. On se demande si le congrès sera ouvert, ou si
avant d'exister, l'Europe connaîtra les motifs qui l'ont empêché.
Plusieurs ministres sont d'avis qu'il est peut-être préférable de le
dissoudre pour le moment, et d'en réunir un nouveau d'ici à quelque
temps, lorsqu'on voudra s'éclairer mieux sur les véritables besoins de
l'Europe.

Le prince de Metternich a répondu aux ministres prussiens sur la note
qui demande d'obtenir la Saxe, pour compléter les dix millions de
population qui composaient la monarchie prussienne en 1805. Cette
réponse ne décide rien, et ne consent à rien. Elle discute plutôt et
fait sentir que la question de la Saxe ne peut pas être traitée
isolément, et doit se rattacher aux arrangements à prendre sur les
nouvelles limites en Pologne.

Dans cet état de choses, l'occupation provisoire de la Saxe par les
armées prussiennes va avoir lieu; et cette condescendance de la part
de la cour de Vienne est déjà un événement très fâcheux. Il laisse à
la Russie la faculté de faire ce qui lui conviendra dans le duché de
Varsovie, et fournit à la Prusse tous les moyens de s'affermir en
Saxe.

Il arrivera que le calcul que l'on a voulu faire sur le caractère de
l'empereur de Russie et sur celui du roi de Prusse, sera en défaut; et
nous craignons que de fausses idées de gloire et de _camaraderie_, si
on ose s'exprimer ainsi, les rendent sourds à toute représentation,
que l'Angleterre n'y applaudisse parce qu'elle trouve son intérêt dans
l'exécution de ces projets, et que l'Autriche ne veuille point se
livrer aux chances d'une nouvelle guerre. Le prince de Metternich,
pour couvrir un peu sa honte, fait valoir l'avantage qu'il trouve à ce
que les armées russes sortent de l'Allemagne; et il ne voit pas
qu'elles se concentrent à peu de distance de l'Oder, et que soixante
mille hommes sont encore dans le Holstein. Lord Castlereagh, de son
côté, n'est alarmé que par l'idée de ne pas voir s'exécuter tout comme
il l'entend. Il ne veut faire d'efforts que pour modérer dans
l'empereur de Russie les prétentions qu'il a sur tout le duché de
Varsovie; mais il proteste que la bonne foi qu'il doit mettre dans ses
rapports avec la Prusse, ne lui permet pas de s'opposer a ce qu'elle
garde la Saxe qui assure son agrandissement.

Nous nous persuadons aussi que la religion que professent le roi de
Saxe et sa famille[288] influe sur les dispositions de l'Angleterre,
et qu'elle voit volontiers ces pays retomber dans les mains de princes
protestants. Cette observation est confirmée par le langage habituel
de la légation anglaise.

  [288] La branche cadette de la maison de Saxe, c'est-à-dire la
  branche royale, était catholique.

M. le prince de Talleyrand a eu hier une entrevue avec l'empereur de
Russie qui n'a offert aucun résultat satisfaisant, et qui a confirmé
les craintes que nous avons que ce prince ne marche aveuglément dans
des principes de convenance et d'ambition qui doivent alarmer
l'Europe. Avant son départ pour la Hongrie, où il doit s'arrêter
quatre jours, il a eu une conversation avec le prince de Metternich,
dans laquelle il s'est exprimé de la manière la plus inconvenante.

On se demande maintenant quels sont les moyens de s'opposer au
désordre qui menace de nouveau, dès que l'Autriche et l'Angleterre ne
veulent pas seconder nos efforts. Lord Castlereagh convient à présent
lui-même qu'il s'était cru plus fort à l'égard de l'empereur de
Russie; qu'il avait à regretter de ne pas lui avoir opposé l'Europe
entière réunie dans un congrès comme on le lui avait proposé à Paris,
et qu'on pouvait encore essayer de ce moyen. S'il est sans effet,
comme nous le pensons, il restera au roi la faculté de ne rien
sanctionner; et ce sera la dernière démarche qui sera faite, si aucun
autre moyen ne se présente pour modifier cet état de choses.

Les conférences pour les affaires d'Allemagne continuent.

Il y a eu une contestation entre le roi de Wurtemberg et le nouveau
roi de Hanovre pour la préséance; et la question de savoir qui sera le
chef de la nouvelle ligue germanique ne paraît pas encore décidée.

Il serait possible que la cour de Vienne relevât la couronne impériale
si on consent à la rendre héréditaire dans la maison d'Autriche.
L'Angleterre paraît seconder cette idée, et le prince de Metternich y
cherche peut-être aussi un moyen de relever sa politique et de couvrir
la faiblesse de son système. Il suit ici les errements du comte de
Cobenzl, qui, à l'époque où son souverain abandonna le titre
d'empereur d'Allemagne, le consola, lui et son pays, en stipulant
qu'il serait remplacé par le titre d'empereur d'Autriche.

Dans une des conférences, les ministres prussiens ont proposé et
soutenu que, pour la sûreté de la ligue germanique, les États
confédérés devaient renoncer au droit de légation et à celui de guerre
ou de paix. Les ministres bavarois se sont fortement opposés à ce
système qui rendrait les États de véritables vassaux.

Nº 8.--LE PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND AU ROI LOUIS XVIII.

Vienne, le 25 octobre 1814.

SIRE,

J'ai été bien heureux de recevoir la lettre dont Votre Majesté a
daigné m'honorer, en date du 14 octobre. Elle m'a soutenu et consolé.
Votre Majesté jugera combien j'avais besoin de l'être, par le récit
que j'ai à lui faire d'un entretien que, deux heures avant l'arrivée
du courrier, j'avais eu avec l'empereur Alexandre.

Ainsi que j'ai eu l'honneur de l'écrire à Votre Majesté, j'avais été
averti qu'il avait à plusieurs reprises témoigné l'intention de me
voir. Cet avis m'ayant été donné par trois d'entre ceux qui
l'approchent de plus près, j'avais pu le croire donné par ses ordres,
et j'avais en même temps compris, par ce qui m'avait été dit, qu'il
désirait que je fisse[289] moi-même demander à le voir. Il n'avait
point répondu à lord Castlereagh. Au lieu de cela, il avait fait
notifier à l'Autriche qu'il allait retirer ses troupes de la Saxe et
remettre l'administration de ce pays à la Prusse. Le bruit courait que
l'Autriche y avait consenti, quoique à regret. (Le bruit de ce
consentement était accrédité par les Prussiens.) Enfin, l'empereur
Alexandre était sur le point de partir pour la Hongrie. Toutes ces
raisons m'avaient déterminé à lui faire demander une audience, et
j'avais été prévenu qu'il me recevrait avant hier à six heures.

  [289] Variante: que je _lui_ fisse.

Il y a quatre jours que le prince Adam Czartoryski, pour qui le monde
entier est dans la Pologne, m'étant venu faire une visite, et
s'excusant de ne m'avoir pas vu plus tôt, m'avoua[290] que ce qui l'en
avait surtout empêché, c'était qu'on lui avait dit que j'étais fort
mal dans la question polonaise. «Mieux que tout le monde, lui dis-je:
nous la voulons complète et indépendante.--Ce serait bien beau, me
répliqua-t-il, mais c'est une chimère; les puissances n'y
consentiraient jamais.--Alors, repris-je, la Pologne n'est plus dans
le nord, notre principale affaire. La conservation de la Saxe nous
touche davantage. Nous sommes en première ligne sur cette question;
nous ne sommes qu'en seconde sur celle de la Pologne, quand elle
devient une question de limites. C'est à l'Autriche et à la Prusse à
assurer leurs frontières[291]. Nous désirons qu'elles soient
satisfaites sur ce point; mais, une fois tranquillisés sur votre
voisinage, nous ne mettrons aucun obstacle à ce que l'empereur de
Russie donne au pays qui lui sera cédé la forme de gouvernement qu'il
voudra. Pour cette facilité de notre part, je demande la conservation
du royaume de Saxe.» Cette insinuation avait plu assez au prince Adam
pour que, de chez moi, il se fût rendu immédiatement chez l'empereur,
avec lequel il avait eu une conversation de trois heures. Le résultat
fut que le comte de Nesselrode, que je n'avais pas vu chez moi depuis
les premiers moments de mon arrivée, y vint le lendemain au soir, pour
obtenir des explications que je lui donnai, sans toutefois m'avancer
plus que je ne l'avais fait avec le prince Adam, et en m'attachant à
le convaincre que la conservation du royaume de Saxe était un point
dont il était impossible que Votre Majesté se départît jamais.

  [290] Variante: _avoua_.

  [291] Variante: nous ne sommes qu'en seconde sur celle de la
  Pologne. Quand elle devient une question de limites, c'est à
  l'Autriche et à la Prusse à assurer leurs frontières.

L'empereur sachant ainsi d'avance en quoi il pouvait et en quoi il ne
pouvait pas espérer que je condescendisse à ses vues, j'en tirais cet
avantage, qu'à son abord seul, je pouvais connaître ses dispositions,
et juger si son but, dans l'entretien qu'il m'accordait, était de
proposer des moyens de conciliation ou de notifier des volontés.

Il vint à moi avec quelque embarras. Je lui exprimai le regret de ne
l'avoir encore vu qu'une fois. «Il avait bien voulu, lui dis-je, ne
pas m'accoutumer à une privation de cette nature, lorsque j'avais eu
le bonheur de me trouver dans les mêmes lieux que lui.» Sa réponse fut
qu'il me verrait toujours avec plaisir, que c'était ma faute si je ne
l'avais point vu; pourquoi n'étais-je pas venu? Il a ajouté[292] cette
singulière phrase: «Je suis homme public: on peut toujours me voir.»
Il est à remarquer que ses ministres et ceux de ses serviteurs qu'il
affectionne le plus sont quelquefois plusieurs jours sans pouvoir
l'approcher.--«Parlons d'affaires», me dit-il ensuite.

  [292] Variante: Il _ajouta_.

Je ne fatiguerai point Votre Majesté des détails oiseux d'une
conversation qui a duré une heure et demie. Je dois d'autant moins
craindre de me borner à l'essentiel, que, quelque soin que je prenne
d'abréger ce que j'ai à dire, comme sorti de la bouche de l'empereur
de Russie, Votre Majesté le trouvera peut-être encore au-dessus de
toute croyance.

«A Paris, me dit-il, vous étiez de l'avis d'un royaume de Pologne.
Comment se fait-il que vous ayez changé?--Mon avis, Sire, est encore
le même. A Paris, il s'agissait du rétablissement de toute la Pologne.
Je voulais alors, comme je voudrais aujourd'hui, son indépendance.
Mais il s'agit maintenant de tout autre chose. La question est
subordonnée à une fixation de limites qui mette l'Autriche et la
Prusse en sûreté.--Elles ne doivent point être inquiètes. Du reste,
j'ai deux cent mille hommes dans le duché de Varsovie; que
l'on m'en chasse! J'ai donné la Saxe à la Prusse; l'Autriche y
consent.--J'ignore, lui dis-je, si l'Autriche y consent. J'aurais
peine à le croire, tant cela est contre son intérêt. Mais le
consentement de l'Autriche peut-il rendre la Prusse propriétaire de ce
qui appartient au roi de Saxe?--Si le roi de Saxe n'abdique pas, il
sera conduit en Russie; il y mourra. Un autre roi y est déjà mort
[293].--Votre Majesté me permettra de ne pas l'en[294] croire. Le
congrès n'a pas été réuni pour voir un pareil attentat.--Comment, un
attentat! Quoi! Stanislas n'est-il pas allé en Russie? Pourquoi le roi
de Saxe n'irait-il pas? Le cas de l'un est celui de l'autre. Il n'y a
pour moi aucune différence.» J'avais trop à répondre. J'avoue à Votre
Majesté que je ne savais comment contenir mon indignation.

  [293] Stanislas II Poniatowski, dernier roi de Pologne. Il abdiqua
  en 1795, se retira à Grodno où il vécut d'une pension que lui
  firent les puissances copartageantes, et mourut deux ans après à
  Pétersbourg.

  [294] Variante: de ne pas _la_ croire.

L'empereur parlait vite. Une de ses phrases a été celle-ci: «Je
croyais que la France me devait quelque chose. Vous me parlez toujours
de principes. Votre droit public n'est rien pour moi; je ne sais ce
que c'est. Quel cas croyez-vous que je fasse de tous vos parchemins et
de vos traités[295]?» (Je lui avais rappelé celui par lequel les
alliés sont convenus que le duché de Varsovie serait partagé entre les
trois cours.) «Il y a pour moi une chose qui est au-dessus de tout,
c'est ma parole. Je l'ai donnée et je la tiendrai. J'ai promis la Saxe
au roi de Prusse au moment où nous nous sommes rejoints.--Votre
Majesté a promis au roi de Prusse de neuf à dix millions d'âmes. Elle
peut les lui donner sans détruire la Saxe.» (J'avais un tableau des
pays qu'on pouvait donner à la Prusse, et qui, sans renverser la Saxe,
lui formeraient le nombre de sujets que ses traités lui assurent.
L'empereur l'a pris et gardé.) «Le roi de Saxe est un traître.--Sire,
la qualification de traître ne peut jamais être donnée à un roi; et il
importe qu'elle ne puisse jamais lui être donnée.» J'ai peut-être mis
un peu d'expression à cette dernière partie de ma phrase. Après un
moment de silence: «Le roi de Prusse, me dit-il, sera roi de Prusse et
de Saxe, comme je serai empereur de Russie et roi de Pologne. Les
complaisances que la France aura pour moi sur ces deux points seront
la mesure de celles que j'aurai moi-même pour elle sur tout ce qui
peut l'intéresser.»

  [295] De _tous_ vos traités.

Dans le cours de cette conversation, l'empereur ne s'est point, comme
dans la première que j'avais eue[296] avec lui, livré à de grands
mouvements. Il était absolu, et avait tout ce qui montre de
l'irritation.

  [296] Que _j'ai_ eue.

Après m'avoir dit qu'il me reverrait, il s'est rendu au bal
particulier de la cour où je l'ai suivi, ayant eu l'honneur d'y être
invité. J'y ai trouvé lord Castlereagh, et je commençais de
causer[297] avec lui, quand l'empereur Alexandre, qui nous a aperçus
dans une embrasure, l'a appelé. Il l'a conduit dans une autre pièce et
lui a parlé à peu près vingt minutes. Lord Castlereagh ensuite est
revenu à moi. Il m'a dit être fort peu satisfait de ce qui lui avait
été dit.

  [297] Variante: _à_ causer.

Lord Castlereagh, je n'en puis douter, s'est fait à lui-même ou a reçu
de sa cour l'ordre de suivre le plan dont j'ai eu l'honneur
d'entretenir Votre Majesté par ma lettre du 19 de ce mois. Ce plan
consiste à isoler la France, à la réduire à ses propres forces en la
privant de toute alliance, et à l'empêcher d'avoir une marine
puissante. Ainsi, quand Votre Majesté ne porte au congrès que des vues
de justice et de bienveillance, l'Angleterre n'y apporte qu'un esprit
de jalousie et d'intérêt tout personnel. Mais lord Castlereagh trouve
à l'exécution de son plan des difficultés qu'il n'avait pas prévues.
Comme il voudrait éviter le reproche d'avoir laissé l'Europe en proie
à la Russie, il voudrait détacher d'elle les puissances qu'il désire
mettre en opposition avec la France. Ce qu'il voudrait par-dessus
tout, ce serait que la Prusse devînt, comme la Hollande, une puissance
tout anglaise, dont, avec des subsides, l'Angleterre pût disposer à
son gré. Comme il convient à cette manière de voir que la Prusse soit
forte, il voudrait l'agrandir, et en avoir seul le mérite[298]
vis-à-vis d'elle. Mais l'ardeur que porte l'empereur Alexandre dans
les intérêts du roi de Prusse ne le permet pas. Le but auquel tend
lord Castlereagh est d'unir, si cela est possible, la Prusse à
l'Autriche, et le genre d'agrandissement qu'il veut procurer à la
Prusse est précisément un obstacle à cette union. Il voudrait rompre
les liens qui existent entre le roi de Prusse et l'empereur Alexandre,
et il cherche à en former d'autres que repoussent les habitudes, les
souvenirs, une rivalité suspendue, mais non pas éteinte, et qu'une
foule d'intérêts viendront infailliblement rallumer. D'ailleurs, avant
d'unir la Prusse et l'Autriche, il faut mettre à couvert les intérêts
de cette dernière monarchie et pourvoir à sa sûreté, chose pour
laquelle[299] lord Castlereagh trouve un obstacle dans les prétentions
de la Russie. Ainsi le problème qu'il s'est proposé, et que, j'espère,
il ne parviendra pas à résoudre contre la France, au degré du moins où
il est probable qu'il le désire, présente des difficultés capables
d'arrêter un génie plus puissant que le sien. Pour lui, il n'en voit
point d'autres que celles qui viennent de l'empereur Alexandre, car il
n'hésite pas à sacrifier la Saxe.

  [298] Variante: et en avoir _tout_ le mérite.

  [299] Variante: chose _à_ laquelle.

J'ai pu dire à lord Castlereagh que l'embarras qu'il éprouvait tenait
à sa conduite et à celle de M. de Metternich; que c'étaient eux qui
avaient fait l'empereur de Russie ce qu'il était; que si, dès le
principe, au lieu de repousser ma proposition de convoquer le congrès,
ils l'eussent appuyée, rien de ce qui se passe ne serait arrivé;
qu'ils avaient voulu se placer seuls vis-à-vis de la Russie et de la
Prusse et qu'ils s'étaient trouvés trop faibles; mais que, si
l'empereur de Russie, dès le premier jour, eût été placé vis-à-vis du
congrès, et par conséquent, du voeu de toute l'Europe, il n'aurait
jamais osé tenir le langage qu'il tenait aujourd'hui. Lord Castlereagh
en est convenu, a regretté que le congrès ne se fût pas réuni plus
tôt, a désiré qu'il le fût prochainement, et m'a proposé de concerter
avec lui une forme de convocation qui ne donnât lieu à aucune
objection, et réservât les difficultés qui pourraient s'élever pour le
moment de la vérification des pouvoirs.

M. de Zeugwitz, officier saxon arrivant de Londres, et qui, avant son
départ, a vu le prince régent, rapporte que le prince lui a parlé du
roi de Saxe dans les termes du plus vif intérêt, et lui a dit qu'il
avait donné à ses ministres au congrès l'ordre de défendre les
principes conservateurs et de ne point s'en départir. Le prince régent
avait tenu le même langage au duc Léopold de Saxe-Cobourg[300], qui me
l'a dit à moi-même, il y a deux jours. Je dois donc croire que la
marche que tient ici la mission anglaise est fort opposée aux voeux et
à l'opinion personnelle[301] du prince régent.

  [300] Le futur roi des Belges. On sait qu'il allait épouser en 1816
  la princesse Charlotte, petite-fille du roi George III.

  [301] Variante: _à l'opinion et au voeu personnel_.

L'Autriche n'a point encore consenti à ce que, comme l'avait dit[302]
l'empereur de Russie, la Saxe fût donnée à la Prusse. Elle a dit, au
contraire, que la question de la Saxe était essentiellement
subordonnée à celle de la Pologne, et qu'elle ne pouvait répondre sur
la première que lorsque l'autre serait réglée. Mais quoique dans sa
note elle ait parlé du projet de sacrifier la Saxe comme d'une chose
qui lui était infiniment pénible et qui était odieuse, elle a trop
laissé entrevoir la disposition de céder sur ce point si elle obtenait
satisfaction sur l'autre. On assure même que l'empereur d'Autriche a
dit à son beau-frère, le prince Antoine (de Saxe), que la cause de la
Saxe était perdue. Ce qu'il y a de sûr, c'est que l'Autriche consent à
ce que la Saxe soit occupée par des troupes prussiennes, et
administrée pour le compte du roi de Prusse.

  [302] Variante: comme _me_ l'avait dit.

Cependant l'opinion publique se prononce chaque jour davantage en
faveur de la cause du roi de Saxe et de ceux qui la défendent. C'est
sûrement à cela que je dois attribuer l'accueil flatteur qu'il y a
trois jours, à un bal chez le comte Zichy[303], et avant-hier au bal
de la cour, les archiducs et l'impératrice d'Autriche elle-même,
voulurent bien me faire.

  [303] Le comte Zichy de Vasonykio, d'une famille ancienne et
  considérable de Hongrie. Né en 1753, il fut président de la cour
  aulique de Hongrie (1788) et devint plus tard ministre de la guerre
  (1803). Il mourut en 1826.

L'empereur d'Autriche est parti hier matin pour Ofen[304], précédant
l'empereur de Russie, qui est parti le soir. Il va pleurer sur le
tombeau de la grande-duchesse sa soeur, qu'avait épousée l'archiduc
palatin; après quoi le bal et les fêtes qu'on lui a préparés
l'occuperont tout entier. Il sera de retour à Vienne le 29.

  [304] Nom allemand de Bude.

Comme, en partant, il n'a laissé ni pouvoirs ni direction à personne,
il ne pourra rien être discuté, et il ne se passera sûrement rien
d'important pendant son absence.

J'ai vu ce soir M. de Metternich, qui reprenait un peu de courage. Je
lui ai parlé avec toute la force dont je suis capable. Les généraux
autrichiens, dont j'ai vu un grand nombre, se déclarent pour la
conservation de la Saxe. Ils font à ce sujet des raisonnements
militaires qui commencent à faire impression.

Je suis...

Nº 4 _ter_.--LE ROI LOUIS XVIII AU PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND.

Vienne, le 27 octobre 1814.

Mon cousin,

J'ai reçu votre numéro 6. J'ai été au plus pressé, en vous envoyant
par le courrier de mardi le supplément d'instructions que vous m'avez
demandé. J'espère[305] que vos démarches en conséquence suffiront,
mais, comme je vous le mandais (nº 3 _ter_) il faut faire voir _qu'il
y a quelque chose derrière_, et je vais donner des ordres pour que
l'armée soit mise en état d'entrer en campagne. Dieu m'est témoin que
loin de vouloir la guerre, mon désir serait d'avoir quelques années de
calme pour panser à loisir les plaies de l'État, mais je veux
par-dessus tout conserver intact l'honneur de la France, et empêcher
de s'établir des principes et un ordre de choses aussi contraires à
toute morale que préjudiciables au repos. Je veux aussi (et cela n'est
pas moins nécessaire) faire respecter mon caractère personnel et ne
pas permettre qu'on puisse, d'après l'aventure du chargé d'affaires
d'Espagne, dire que je ne suis fort qu'avec les faibles. Ma vie, ma
couronne ne sont rien pour moi, à côté d'intérêts aussi majeurs.

  [305] Variante: _et j'espère_.

Il me serait pourtant bien pénible d'être forcé de m'allier pour cela
avec l'Autriche, et avec l'Autriche seule. Je ne conçois pas que[306]
lord Castlereagh, qui a si bien parlé sur la Pologne, peut être d'un
avis différent sur la Saxe. Je compterais beaucoup pour le ramener sur
les efforts du comte de Munster, si le langage du duc de Wellington à
ce même sujet ne me faisait craindre que ce ne fût le système, non du
ministre, mais du ministère. Les arguments pour le combattre ne
manqueraient assurément pas; mais les exemples font quelquefois plus
d'effet, et j'en conçois[307] un bien frappant: c'est celui de Charles
XII. Le supplice de Patkul[308] prouve assez combien ce prince était
vindicatif et peu scrupuleux à l'égard du droit des gens; et
cependant, maître, on peut le dire, de tous les États du roi Auguste,
il se contenta de lui enlever la Pologne et ne se crut pas permis de
toucher à la Saxe. Il me semble qu'en comparant les deux
circonstances, l'analogie est évidente du duché de Varsovie avec le
royaume de Pologne, et de la Saxe avec elle-même. Sur quoi, je prie
Dieu, qu'il vous ait, mon cousin, en sa sainte et digne garde.

LOUIS.

  [306] Variante: Je ne conçois pas _comment_.

  [307] Variante: et j'en _connais_.

  [308] Patkul (1660-1707) était un gentilhomme livonien. La Livonie
  était alors soumise à la Suède. Patkul essaya à plusieurs reprises
  de réunir sa patrie à la Russie, et suscita divers soulèvements
  contre les Suédois. Pierre le Grand l'envoya comme ambassadeur
  auprès du roi de Pologne Auguste III, qui pour se concilier Charles
  XII, le livra à ce prince. Patkul fut aussitôt traduit devant un
  conseil de guerre qui le condamna à être roué et écartelé.

_P.-S._--Je reçois votre numéro 7. Il me confirme dans la résolution
de prendre une attitude militaire capable de me faire respecter.

J'approuve la déclaration que vous vous proposez de faire à l'empereur
de Russie, et je voudrais que votre conférence avec lui eût déjà eu
lieu.

Je vous autorise à reconnaître en mon nom au roi de la Grande-Bretagne
le titre de roi de Hanovre.

Nº 9 _bis_.--LES AMBASSADEURS DU ROI AU CONGRÈS, AU MINISTRE DES
AFFAIRES ÉTRANGÈRES A PARIS.

Vienne, le 31 octobre 1814.

Monsieur le comte,

L'époque fixée pour l'ouverture du congrès approchait, et c'est
hier soir seulement que M. le prince de Metternich a jugé à propos
d'avoir chez lui une conférence à laquelle ont été appelés les
plénipotentiaires des huit puissances signataires du traité de Paris.

M. le prince de Talleyrand y est venu et a présenté comme
plénipotentiaires français MM. le duc de Dalberg et le comte de la
Tour du Pin.

L'ambassadeur de Portugal y a amené quatre plénipotentiaires, et le
prince de Metternich s'était associé M. le baron de Wessemberg[309].

  [309] Jean-Philippe, baron de Wessemberg-Ampfingen, né en 1773,
  diplomate autrichien. Il représenta l'Autriche à la diète, lors de
  l'affaire des sécularisations (1802), fut ensuite ambassadeur à
  Berlin, puis à Munich et à Londres. Il assista M. de Metternich au
  congrès de Vienne. En 1848, il fut un instant ministre des affaires
  étrangères. Il mourut en 1858.

Le prince de Talleyrand avait, pour faciliter la besogne, fait rédiger
des articles de procès-verbal, dont le contenu présentait les moyens
de régulariser la marche du congrès. (Voyez pièces n{os} 1 à 5.)

Il s'en était entretenu la veille avec lord Castlereagh, qui, tout en
les approuvant, avait insinué qu'il fallait en causer avec le prince
de Metternich, et que tout ce qui viendrait de la part de la France
inspirerait toujours une sorte de défiance.

Le prince de Talleyrand les a communiqués avant la séance à M. le
prince de Metternich et à quelques autres plénipotentiaires.

A l'ouverture de la conférence, M. de Metternich a prononcé un
discours fort diffus dont le but était de déclarer que les
communications confidentielles qui avaient eu lieu sur les affaires de
Pologne n'avaient point encore amené de résultats, mais qu'on était à
la veille de décider cette question; que les conférences allemandes
avançaient le travail d'un pacte fédéral qui présenterait à l'Europe
une nouvelle garantie de repos; que, dans cet état de choses, il
n'était pas d'avis d'ajourner le congrès, mais de chercher une forme
qui laissât le temps de terminer ces discussions auxquelles les autres
puissances étaient étrangères. Il insista sur ce que le congrès actuel
ne pouvait pas proprement se nommer ainsi, et que la _forme
délibérante_ ne pouvait y être admise.

Ici, M. le prince de Talleyrand témoigna combien il paraissait
extraordinaire que, d'une conférence à l'autre, on changeât
d'intention et que les mots mêmes changeassent de sens. Qu'à Paris on
avait voulu un congrès; qu'à présent, ce congrès qu'on avait voulu,
ne devait plus avoir lieu, et ne devait pas être un congrès; qu'on a
dû ensuite se réunir au 1er novembre, mais cet _appel_, dit-on, n'a
pas été fait avec les _formalités_ nécessaires; que _l'ouverture_ ne
devait plus être une _ouverture_...

M. de Metternich a terminé son discours en proposant un nouveau délai
de dix à douze jours pour la vérification des pouvoirs que tous les
plénipotentiaires seraient invités d'envoyer à un bureau désigné à cet
effet. Et, parlant de l'influence qui pourrait être exercée sur le
congrès, il dit avec une espèce de malignité qu'il y en avait de deux
espèces: celle des difficultés que l'on pouvait faire naître, ou celle
des facilités que l'on pouvait donner.

Le prince de Talleyrand a relevé cette phrase, en disant que lorsque
tout le monde tend au même but, il n'y a d'autre influence que celle
de l'habileté ou de l'inhabileté.

M. de Metternich a communiqué ensuite un projet de déclaration, qui
est joint sous le numéro 6. Des discussions fort insipides et très
médiocrement engagées ont occupé pendant deux heures. Elles ont
signalé la légèreté et le peu de réflexion que l'on a apporté à
d'aussi importantes matières.

On est enfin convenu:

1º De ne point ajourner le congrès;

2º De nommer une commission pour vérifier les pouvoirs:

3º De se réunir le lendemain pour entendre la lecture d'un nouveau
projet de convocation; décider la question de savoir si le travail
pouvait se faire par des commissions nommées par le congrès pour être
revu dans un comité général, et déterminer la forme de délibération
qui serait admise.

On est convenu aussi que les rédactions présentées par les
commissaires français serviraient de base à la discussion fixée au
lendemain.

La commission pour la vérification des pleins pouvoirs a été tirée au
sort. C'est la Russie, l'Angleterre et la Prusse qui sont désignées.
Un rapport sera fait par elle, lorsque les pouvoirs auront été
présentés.

Ces conclusions donnent l'idée qu'un pas de plus a été fait; mais, en
examinant l'état des choses, on doit être convaincu:

1º Que les quatre puissances n'ont pas renoncé à établir le système
d'équilibre qu'elles ont imaginé à leur avantage;

2º Qu'elles veulent tenir la France éloignée de toute influence;

3º Que leur embarras du moment tient aux prétentions exagérées de
l'empereur de Russie, auxquelles on ne s'attendait pas;

4º Que, pour sortir de cet embarras, on voudrait sacrifier la Saxe et
avoir l'air d'être d'accord sur la Pologne;

5º Que les principes que le roi de France a proclamés ont rappelé
l'Europe à sa propre dignité, et que la voix qu'il fait entendre, si
elle n'a pas encore rallié tous les esprits sages, finira par être
écoutée un jour.

On voit ici la faiblesse du ministère autrichien, l'oubli de tout
principe de la part des cabinets de Russie et de Prusse, et les
préventions du cabinet de Londres contre la France, tout à découvert.
Et on ne peut résister à d'aussi fortes intrigues qu'en marchant ferme
dans la voie de la raison, et en s'étayant de tout ce qu'elle prescrit
de sage à l'égard de l'existence et des rapports des sociétés
publiques entre elles.

Si les puissances directement intéressées à l'arrangement de la
Pologne parviennent à s'entendre sur une limite qui ne renverse pas
tout équilibre dans cette partie de l'Europe, il nous reste l'espoir
que les choses en général s'arrangeront, et nous attendons avec
patience qu'on nous en donne communication. Par une stipulation
secrète, la Russie, la Prusse et l'Autriche sont convenues de régler
le partage du grand-duché de Varsovie sans que la France puisse y
intervenir, et nous croyons n'avoir rien à regretter à cet égard.

Si elles s'entendent, l'Europe sera tranquille. Si elles n'y
réussissent pas, la coalition est dissoute et la France se trouvera
appelée à l'intervention la plus honorable qu'elle ait jamais pu
exercer dans les affaires publiques.

On n'est pas encore à portée de pressentir la dernière disposition de
l'empereur de Russie qui, seul, par sa présomption et son esprit
romanesque est à la veille de rallumer la guerre et de troubler pour
longtemps l'Europe.

Il est revenu avant-hier soir de la course qu'il a faite en Hongrie
avec l'empereur d'Autriche et le roi de Prusse.

Ce voyage qu'il a provoqué était encore marqué par l'intrigue. Il a
voulu cajoler la nation hongroise et s'entourer des chefs du clergé
grec, très nombreux en Hongrie. Nous tenons de lord Castlereagh
lui-même, que déjà les Grecs fomentent la guerre contre la Turquie;
que les Serviens viennent de reprendre les armes; qu'un corps russe se
porte sur la frontière. Et pendant que l'empereur de Russie se livre à
des projets d'agitation de ce côté, il annonce ici, aux ministres
suisses qu'il ne quittera pas Vienne sans avoir fini leurs affaires.
Il a nommé, à ce qui nous a été dit, M. le baron de Stein[310] pour
conférer avec eux.

  [310] Charles, baron de Stein, né en 1757 à Nassau, d'une famille
  noble et ancienne. Il entra en 1779 au service de la Prusse, fut
  nommé en 1784 ministre à Aschaffenbourg et entra dans le cabinet en
  1804. Il se montra très hostile à la France. Aussi dut-il se
  retirer après la bataille d'Iéna. Rappelé en 1807, il ne tarda pas
  à exciter la défiance de Napoléon, qui exigea son renvoi (1808); il
  se réfugia en Autriche. En 1812 il alla en Russie, où il fut
  accueilli avec empressement par l'empereur, qui se l'attacha, et
  dont il fut un des conseillers les plus écoutés. Durant les années
  1813 et 1814, il excita par tous les moyens les passions allemandes
  contre la France, et suivit les souverains alliés à Paris. Il vint
  ensuite au congrès de Vienne, où il retrouva l'empereur Alexandre
  qui se servit de lui en plusieurs occasions. Plénipotentiaire au
  congrès d'Aix-la-Chapelle en 1818, conseiller d'État en 1827, il
  mourut en 1831.

Avant son départ pour la Hongrie, il a ordonné qu'on préparât une
réponse à lord Castlereagh sur la question de la Pologne, et que l'on
rédigeât des mémoires sur le rétablissement et l'organisation de ce
pays.

S'il persiste, c'est à ce rapport que les événements de l'Europe vont
se rattacher infailliblement, et peut-être cela se fera-t-il au
désavantage de la Russie.

On croit que la réponse sera remise à lord Castlereagh dès que
l'empereur Alexandre l'aura corrigée et approuvée. On la croit de
nature à établir les prétentions de créer une Pologne dans le duché de
Varsovie, et de donner la Saxe à la Prusse.

La grande-duchesse d'Oldenbourg disait avant-hier que ces deux
questions lui paraissaient décidées _par son frère_.

Nous avons répété souvent que, pour l'empêcher, il n'y avait d'autre
moyen que d'opposer l'opinion de l'Europe à l'abus que la Russie
voudrait faire de ses forces, et que c'était pour cette raison qu'il
fallait convoquer le congrès et lui donner le plus de dignité
possible. Si la Russie devenait tout envahissante, la France devrait
être toute protectrice.

Sans la faiblesse de M. de Metternich et les préventions de lord
Castlereagh contre une influence quelconque de la France dans les
affaires de l'Europe, la chose s'exécuterait. Cependant cette position
se prolonge et on peut dire que, pendant que l'on craint encore la
France, on s'aveugle sur tous les autres dangers.

Au milieu de tous ces mouvements pour ramener l'empereur de Russie à
des idées modérées sur la Pologne, les conférences allemandes
présentent quelque intérêt par la conduite qu'y tient la Bavière.

Le plan de la Prusse était de former une ligue très étroite, et d'en
partager la direction avec l'Autriche. La Bavière a déjoué cette
proposition en demandant que la direction alternât. Elle sentait que
la Prusse voulait s'appuyer de cette ligue pour consolider son
usurpation sur la Saxe. Et comme elle ne veut pas y consentir, elle
fera connaître ses intentions lorsque l'occupation de la Saxe lui sera
connue officiellement; et à cette époque, elle doit déclarer qu'elle
ne coopérera point à ce résultat. Pour se mettre en mesure de soutenir
ce rôle indépendant, la Bavière vient d'ordonner une forte levée de
recrues, et porte son armée à soixante-dix mille hommes.

Vous voyez, monsieur le comte, que si, dans nos dernières dépêches,
nous avons engagé le roi à prendre l'attitude qui convient à sa
dignité et au besoin du moment, nous avons fait en sorte qu'il n'ait
pas à craindre d'être compromis avec les forces d'une coalition qui
armerait contre la France, et qu'il se trouve, au contraire, à la tête
de celles qui se réuniront pour défendre les libertés de l'Europe, si
on les menace.

L'article du _Moniteur_[311], qui proclame hautement les principes et
le système qui dirigent la politique du roi, a fait ici la plus vive
sensation et il a été généralement applaudi. Nous avons observé que
tandis qu'on répandait que les armées françaises, chagrines de la
perte des conquêtes, entraîneraient le gouvernement dans une nouvelle
guerre et qu'il fallait rester sous les armes, ce même gouvernement
avait assez de force et dirigeait assez bien l'opinion publique pour
déclarer que la France était contente de ses limites, parce qu'elle
trouvait en elle tous les éléments de force et de prospérité dont
elle avait besoin pour être heureuse.

  [311] Voici cet article:

  «La déclaration précédente (_celle des plénipotentiaires qui
  ajournait l'ouverture du congrès au 1er novembre, voir pages 345 et
  suivantes_), en exposant les motifs qui font différer l'ouverture
  du congrès de Vienne, est le premier garant de l'esprit de sagesse
  qui dirigera les travaux des plénipotentiaires assemblés. C'est en
  effet par la maturité des conseils, c'est dans le calme des
  passions, que doit renaître la tutélaire autorité des principes du
  droit public, invoqués et reconnus dans le dernier traité de Paris.

  »Ainsi la juste attente des contemporains sera remplie, et l'on
  obtiendra, dans les prochaines négociations, un résultat conforme à
  ce que le droit des gens et la loi universelle de justice
  prescrivent aux nations entre elles.

  »A l'époque où de grandes puissances se sont liguées pour ramener
  dans les relations mutuelles des États le respect des propriétés et
  la sûreté des trônes, on ne peut attendre que des transactions
  politiques revêtues de cet équitable caractère.

  »Déjà l'Europe accepte cet heureux augure, et la France, qui n'est
  jalouse d'aucun des avantages que d'autres États peuvent
  raisonnablement espérer, n'aspire qu'au rétablissement d'un juste
  équilibre. Ayant en elle tous les éléments de force et de
  prospérité, elle ne les cherche point au delà de ses limites; elle
  ne prête l'oreille à aucune insinuation tendant à établir des
  systèmes de simple convenance; et reprenant le rôle qui lui assura
  jadis l'estime et la reconnaissance des peuples, elle n'ambitionne
  d'autre gloire que celle dont les garanties reposent sur l'alliance
  de la force avec la modération et la justice; elle veut redevenir
  l'appui du faible et le défenseur de l'opprimé.

  »Dans cette disposition, la France concourra aux arrangements
  propres à consolider la paix générale; et les souverains qui ont si
  noblement proclamé les mêmes principes, consacreront avec elle ce
  pacte durable qui doit assurer le repos du monde.»

  (_Moniteur_, 22 oct. 1814.)

C'est ainsi que l'on désarmera la masse de haines et de défiances qui
s'élève encore contre nous, et que l'on ramènera la confiance, but
principal auquel il faut tendre, pour donner au roi la force et la
dignité qui lui conviennent dans ses relations avec l'Europe.

Nº 10 _bis_.--LES AMBASSADEURS DU ROI AU CONGRÈS, AU MINISTRE DES
AFFAIRES ÉTRANGÈRES A PARIS.

Vienne, le 31 octobre 1814.

Monsieur le comte,

La conférence indiquée dans notre lettre de ce jour a eu lieu ce soir,
avant l'expédition du courrier. Nous avons l'honneur de vous
entretenir de son résultat.

Après la lecture du protocole de la conférence du 30, on a voté la
déclaration dont copie est ci-jointe. Elle sera imprimée dans la
journée de demain.

On a approuvé les projets remis hier par M. le prince de Talleyrand et
portés dans la correspondance sous les numéros 2 et 3. M. de
Metternich a proposé de délibérer sur ceux numéros 4 et 5; M. de
Nesselrode a demandé qu'on voulût bien ajourner à demain cette
délibération, n'ayant pas eu le temps de prendre les ordres de
l'empereur. Cela a été agréé.

Dans une conversation entre les deux empereurs en Hongrie, où l'on a
discuté les questions qui paraissaient devoir les diviser, l'empereur
de Russie a dit: «Je n'ai pas encore donné mon dernier mot.»

A la séance d'aujourd'hui, lord Castlereagh avait avec lui lords
Stewart, Cathcart[312] et Clancarty[313].

  [312] Lord William Cathcart, né en 1755, entra dans l'armée, fit la
  campagne d'Amérique, devint brigadier général en 1793, et servit
  comme tel en Hollande. Il fut nommé pair d'Écosse en 1807, membre
  du conseil privé, et vice-amiral. Il dirigea en 1809 l'expédition
  contre Copenhague. En 1812 il alla à Pétersbourg comme ambassadeur,
  suivit le quartier général de l'empereur Alexandre durant les
  campagnes de 1813 et 1814, et signa le traité de Paris du 30 mai.
  Il fut envoyé à Vienne comme plénipotentiaire au congrès. En 1815,
  il fut créé pair d'Angleterre. Il mourut en 1843.

  [313] Richard Power-Trench, comte de Clancarty, conseiller privé,
  président du comité du conseil privé pour les colonies et le
  commerce, maître général des postes. En 1814, il fut accrédité à
  Vienne comme plénipotentiaire.

On a annoncé que MM. les comtes de Rasumoffski[314] et de
Stackelberg[315] assisteraient de la part de la Russie à la première
conférence.

Agréez...

  [314] André, comte puis prince Rasumoffski, né en 1752, diplomate
  russe, fut successivement ambassadeur à Stockholm, à Naples puis à
  Vienne, où il assista au congrès. Il mourut en 1836.

  [315] Gustave, comte de Stackelberg, conseiller intime et
  chambellan de l'empereur Alexandre. Il était alors ambassadeur de
  Russie à Vienne, et assista comme tel au congrès.

Nº 9.--LE PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND AU ROI LOUIS XVIII.

Vienne, le 31 octobre 1814.

SIRE,

L'état des choses est en apparence toujours le même; mais quelques
symptômes d'un changement ont commencé de se laisser entrevoir, et
peuvent acquérir plus d'intensité par la conduite[316] et le langage
de l'empereur Alexandre.

  [316] Variante: _la manière d'être_.

Le matin du jour où il partit pour la Hongrie, il eut avec M. de
Metternich un entretien dans lequel il passe pour constant qu'il
traita ce ministre avec une hauteur et une violence de langage qui
auraient pu paraître extraordinaires, même à l'égard d'un de ses
serviteurs. _On raconte que_[317] M. de Metternich lui ayant dit, au
sujet de la Pologne, que, s'il était question d'en faire une, eux
aussi le pouvaient, il avait non seulement qualifié cette observation
d'inconvenante et d'indécente, mais encore qu'il s'était emporté
jusqu'à dire que M. de Metternich était le seul en Autriche qui pût
prendre ainsi _un ton de révolte_. On ajoute que les choses avaient
été poussées si loin que M. de Metternich lui avait déclaré qu'il
allait prier son maître de nommer un autre ministre que lui pour le
congrès. M. de Metternich sortit de cet entretien dans un état où les
personnes de son intimité disent qu'elles ne l'avaient jamais vu. Lui
qui, peu de jours auparavant, avait dit au comte de Schulenburg qu'il
se retranchait derrière le temps, et se faisait une arme de la
patience, pourrait fort bien la perdre, si elle était mise souvent à
pareille épreuve.

  [317] Supprimé dans le texte des archives.

S'il ne doit pas être disposé par là à des complaisances pour
l'empereur de Russie, l'opinion des militaires autrichiens que je vois
et celle des archiducs ne doivent pas le disposer davantage à
l'abandon de la Saxe. J'ai lieu de croire que l'empereur d'Autriche
est maintenant disposé à faire quelque résistance.

Il y a ici un comte de Sickingen, qui est admis dans l'intimité de ce
prince et que je connais. Après le départ pour la Hongrie, il est allé
chez le maréchal de Wrède, et il est venu chez moi, nous engager[318]
de la part de l'empereur à tenir tout en suspens jusqu'à son retour.

  [318] Variante: _pour_ nous engager.

Cette conversation m'est revenue, et à peu près dans les mêmes termes,
et par M. de Sickingen et par M. de Metternich. Il paraît que
l'empereur, peu accoutumé à montrer de la force, était revenu fort
content de lui-même.

On raconte que pendant le voyage à Bude, d'où les souverains revinrent
avant-hier à midi, l'empereur Alexandre se plaignant de M. de
Metternich, l'empereur François avait répondu qu'il croyait qu'il
était mieux que les affaires fussent traitées par les ministres;
qu'elles l'étaient avec plus de liberté et plus de suite; qu'il ne
faisait point lui-même les siennes, mais que ses ministres ne
faisaient rien que par ses ordres; qu'ensuite, et dans le cours de la
conversation, il avait dit, entre autres choses que, quand ses[319]
peuples, qui ne l'avaient jamais abandonné, qui avaient tout fait pour
lui et lui avaient tout donné, étaient inquiets, comme ils l'étaient
en ce moment, son devoir était de faire tout ce qui pouvait servir à
les tranquilliser; que, sur cela, l'empereur Alexandre ayant demandé
si son caractère et sa loyauté ne devaient pas prévenir et ôter toute
espèce d'inquiétude, l'empereur François avait répondu que de bonnes
frontières étaient les meilleures gardiennes de la paix.
Toutes les précautions prises pour nous dérober la connaissance de ce
qui se fait à la commission de l'organisation politique de l'Allemagne
ont été sans succès.

  [319] Variante: _les_ peuples.

A la première séance, il fut proposé par la Prusse que tous les
princes dont les États se trouvaient en totalité compris dans la
confédération renonçassent au droit de guerre et de paix et de
légation[320]. Le maréchal de Wrède ayant décliné cette proposition,
M. de Humboldt s'écria qu'on voyait bien que la Bavière avait encore
au fond du coeur une alliance avec la France, et que c'était pour eux
une raison nouvelle d'insister. Mais à la seconde séance, le maréchal
qui avait pris les ordres du roi, ayant péremptoirement rejeté la
proposition, elle a été retirée, et on y a substitué celle de placer
toutes les forces militaires de la confédération, moitié sous la
direction de l'Autriche et moitié sous celle de la Prusse. Le maréchal
de Wrède a demandé que le nombre des directeurs fût augmenté et que la
direction alternât entre eux. On a proposé en outre de former entre
tous les États confédérés une ligue très étroite pour défendre l'état
de possession de chacun, tel qu'il sera établi par les arrangements
qui vont se faire. Le roi de Bavière, qui a bien compris que par cette
ligue la Prusse avait surtout en vue de s'assurer la possession de la
Saxe contre l'opposition des puissances qui veulent conserver ce
royaume, qui sent bien qu'il aurait tout à craindre lui-même si la
Saxe était une fois sacrifiée, et qui est prêt à la défendre pour peu
qu'il ne soit pas abandonné à ses propres forces, a ordonné de lever
chez lui vingt mille hommes[321], qui porteront son armée à
soixante-dix mille hommes. Loin de vouloir entrer dans la ligue
proposée, son intention, du moins jusqu'à présent, est qu'aussitôt que
les Prussiens se seront emparés de la Saxe, son ministre se retire de
la commission, en déclarant qu'il ne veut pas être complice et bien
moins encore garant d'une telle usurpation.

  [320] Variante: et _à celui de_ légation.

  [321] Variante: _recrues_.

Les Prussiens ne connaissent pas cette intention du roi, mais ils
n'ignorent point ses armements et le soupçonnent très probablement
d'être disposé à joindre ses forces à celles des puissances qui
voudraient défendre la Saxe. Ils sentent d'ailleurs, que, sans le
consentement de la France, la Saxe ne serait point _pour eux_[322] une
acquisition solide. On dit aussi que le cabinet, qui ne partage pas
l'aveugle dévouement du roi à l'empereur Alexandre, n'est pas sans
inquiétude du côté de la Russie, et qu'il renoncerait volontiers[323]
à la Saxe pourvu qu'il retrouvât ailleurs de quoi compléter le nombre
de sujets que la Prusse, d'après ses traités, doit avoir. Quels que
soient ses sentiments et ses vues, les ministres prussiens paraissent
vouloir se rapprocher de nous et nous envoient invitations sur
invitations.

  [322] Supprimé dans le texte des archives.

  [323] Variante: _peut-être_.

Lord Castlereagh qui a imaginé de fortifier la Prusse en deçà de
l'Elbe, sous le prétexte de la faire servir de barrière contre la
Russie, a toujours ce projet fort à coeur. Dans une conversation qu'il
eut il y a peu de jours chez moi, il me reprocha de faire de la
question de la Saxe une question du premier ordre, tandis que, selon
lui, elle n'était rien et que la question de Pologne était tout. Je
lui répondis que la question de la Pologne serait pour moi la première
de toutes, s'il ne l'avait pas réduite à n'être qu'une simple question
de limites. Voulait-il rétablir toute la Pologne dans une entière
indépendance? Je serais avec lui en première ligne. Mais quand il ne
s'agissait que de limites, c'était à l'Autriche et à la Prusse qui y
étaient le plus intéressées à se mettre en avant. Mon rôle alors
devait se borner à les appuyer et je le ferais. Sur son projet d'unir
l'Autriche et la Prusse, je lui fis des raisonnements auxquels il ne
put répondre, et je lui citai sur la politique de la Prusse depuis
soixante ans des faits qu'il ne put nier; mais en passant condamnation
sur les anciens torts de ce cabinet, il se retrancha dans l'espérance
d'un meilleur avenir.

Cependant, je sais qu'il lui a été fait par diverses personnes des
objections qui l'ont frappé. On lui a demandé comment il consentait à
mettre l'une des plus grandes villes commerçantes de l'Allemagne
(Leipsick), où se tient l'une des plus grandes foires de l'Europe,
sous la domination de la Prusse avec laquelle l'Angleterre ne pouvait
pas être sûre d'être toujours en paix, au lieu de la laisser entre les
mains d'un prince avec lequel l'Angleterre ne pouvait jamais avoir
rien à démêler. Il a été frappé d'une sorte d'étonnement et de crainte
de ce que son projet pouvait compromettre en quelque chose l'intérêt
mercantile de l'Angleterre.

Il m'avait invité à concerter avec lui un projet pour la convocation
du congrès. Je lui en avais remis un et il en avait été content.

Je rédigeai aussi quelques projets sur la première réunion des
ministres, sur la vérification des pouvoirs et sur les commissions à
former à la première séance du congrès. (Ces différentes pièces sont
jointes à ma dépêche au département que M. de Jaucourt soumettra à
Votre Majesté.) Devant à lord Castlereagh, M. de Dalberg et moi, une
visite, nous allâmes ensemble les lui porter avant-hier soir. Il n'y
trouva rien à redire, mais il observa que la crainte que les Prussiens
avaient de nous, ferait sûrement qu'ils y soupçonneraient quelque
arrière-pensée. Les craintes réelles ou simulées des Prussiens
amenèrent naturellement la conversation sur l'éternel sujet de la
Pologne et de la Saxe. Il avait sur sa table des cartes avec
lesquelles je lui fis voir que la Saxe étant dans les mêmes mains que
la Silésie, la Bohême pouvait être enlevée en peu de semaines, et que
la Bohême enlevée, le coeur de la monarchie autrichienne était à
découvert et sans défense. Il parut étonné. Il nous avait parlé comme
s'il eût tourné ses espérances du côté de la Prusse par
l'impossibilité d'en mettre aucune dans l'Autriche. Il eut l'air
surpris quand nous lui dîmes qu'il ne lui manquait que de l'argent
pour réunir ses troupes, qu'elle aurait alors les forces les plus
imposantes, et que, pour cela, il lui suffirait aujourd'hui d'un
million sterling. Cela l'anima, et il parut disposé à soutenir
l'affaire de la Pologne jusqu'au bout. Il savait qu'on travaillait
dans la chancellerie russe à une réponse à son mémoire, et il ne
paraissait point s'attendre à ce qu'elle fût satisfaisante. Il était
instruit que les Serviens avaient repris les armes, et il nous apprit
qu'un corps russe, commandé par un des meilleurs généraux de Russie,
s'approchait des frontières de l'empire ottoman. Rien ne lui
paraissait donc plus nécessaire et plus urgent que d'opposer une digue
à l'ambition de la Russie. Mais il voudrait que cela se fît sans
guerre, et que si la guerre ne pouvait être évitée, elle pût se faire
sans le secours de la France. A sa manière d'estimer nos forces, on
peut juger que c'est la France qu'il redoute le plus. «Vous avez, nous
dit-il, vingt-cinq millions d'hommes; nous les estimons comme
quarante millions.» Une fois, il lui échappa de dire: «Ah! s'il ne
vous était resté aucune vue sur la rive gauche du Rhin!». Il me fut
aisé de lui prouver par la situation de la France, par celle de
l'Europe, qui était tout entière en armes, qu'on ne pouvait supposer à
la France de vues ambitieuses sans la supposer insensée. «Soit,
répondit-il, mais une armée française traversant l'Allemagne pour une
cause quelconque ferait trop d'impression et réveillerait trop de
souvenirs.» Je lui représentai que la guerre ne serait point
nécessaire et qu'il suffirait de placer la Russie vis-à-vis de
l'Europe unie dans une même volonté, ce qui nous ramena à l'ouverture
du congrès. Mais lui, parlant toujours de difficultés, sans dire en
quoi consistaient ces difficultés, me conseilla de voir M. de
Metternich, d'où je conclus qu'ils étaient convenus entre eux de
quelque chose, dont il ne m'aurait pas fait mystère s'il eût eu lieu
de croire que je n'aurais rien à y objecter. Du reste, en nous
accusant d'avoir tout retardé, il nous a naïvement avoué que, sans
nous, tout serait maintenant réglé, parce que, dans le principe, ils
étaient d'accord: aveu qui donne la mesure de l'influence que, dans
leur propre opinion, il appartient à Votre Majesté d'avoir sur les
affaires de l'Europe.

Au total, les dispositions de lord Castlereagh, sans être bonnes,
m'ont paru moins éloignées de le devenir, et peut-être la réponse
qu'il attend de l'empereur Alexandre contribuera-t-elle à les
améliorer.

Hier matin, j'ai reçu de M. de Metternich un billet qui m'invitait à
une conférence pour le soir à huit heures.

Je ne fatiguerai point Votre Majesté des détails de cette conférence
qui a été abondante en paroles et vide de choses. Ces détails se
trouvent _d'ailleurs_[324] dans ma lettre au département. Le résultat
a été que l'on a formé une commission de vérification composée de
trois membres nommés par le sort, que les pouvoirs leur seront envoyés
pour être vérifiés, et qu'après la vérification on devra réunir le
congrès.

  [324] Supprimé dans le texte des archives.

Ce soir, une nouvelle conférence a eu lieu. On y a lu et arrêté le
projet de déclaration relatif à la vérification des pouvoirs. Cette
déclaration sera publiée demain. J'en envoie ce soir la copie dans ma
dépêche[325] au département. J'ai cru que Votre Majesté préférerait
que tout ce qui est pièces fût toujours joint à la lettre que
j'adresse à M. de Jaucourt, afin que le département en ait et en
conserve la suite.

  [325] Variante: _et j'en_ envoie ce soir la copie dans _une_
  dépêche.

Telle est depuis huit mois la situation de la France, que, dès qu'elle
a atteint un but, elle en a devant elle un autre qu'une égale
nécessité la presse d'atteindre, le plus souvent sans qu'elle ait à
choisir entre plusieurs moyens d'y arriver. A peine eut-on renversé
l'oppresseur et mis en liberté d'éclater les voeux qui, dans le secret
des coeurs, rappelaient dès longtemps et de toutes parts Votre Majesté
dans le sein de ses États, qu'il fallut pourvoir à ce qu'elle pût
trouver désarmée, au moment de son arrivée, la France couverte de cinq
cent mille étrangers, ce qu'on ne pouvait obtenir qu'en faisant à tout
prix cesser les hostilités par un armistice. Ensuite, pour débarrasser
immédiatement le royaume des armées qui en dévoraient la substance,
il fallut tendre uniquement à la prompte conclusion de la paix. Votre
Majesté semblait ne plus avoir qu'à jouir de l'amour de ses peuples et
du fruit de sa propre sagesse, quand un nouveau but s'est offert à sa
constance et à ses efforts: celui de sauver, s'il se peut, l'Europe
des périls dont la menacent l'ambition et les passions de quelques
puissances et l'aveuglement ou la pusillanimité de quelques autres.
Les difficultés de l'entreprise ne m'en ont jamais fait regarder le
succès comme entièrement impossible. La lettre, dont Votre Majesté a
bien voulu m'honorer en date du 21 octobre, en rehausse en moi
l'espérance, en même temps que les témoignages de satisfaction qu'elle
daigne accorder à mon zèle, me donnent un nouveau courage.

Nº 5 _ter_.--LE ROI LOUIS XVIII AU PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND.

Paris, le 4 novembre 1814.

Mon cousin,

J'ai reçu votre numéro 8. Je l'ai lu avec grand intérêt, mais avec
grande indignation. Le ton et les principes qu'avec tant de raison on
a reproché à Buonaparte[326] n'étaient pas autres que ceux de
l'empereur de Russie. J'aime à me flatter que l'opinion de l'armée et
celle de la famille impériale ramèneront le prince de Metternich à des
vues plus saines; que lord Castlereagh entrera plus qu'il ne l'a fait
jusqu'ici dans celles du prince régent, et qu'alors vous pourrez
employer avec avantage les armes que je vous ai données. Mais quoi
qu'il en puisse être, continuez à mériter les justes éloges que je me
plais à vous répéter aujourd'hui, en restant ferme dans la ligne que
vous suivez, et soyez bien sur que mon nom[327] ne se trouvera jamais
au bas d'un acte qui consacrerait la plus révoltante immoralité.

 [326] Variante: _Bonaparte_.

 [327] Variante: que _jamais mon nom_.

Sur ce, je prie Dieu qu'il vous ait, mon cousin, en sa sainte et digne
garde.

Nº 11 _bis_.--LES AMBASSADEURS DU ROI AU CONGRÈS, AU MINISTRE DES
AFFAIRES ÉTRANGÈRES A PARIS.

Vienne, le 6 novembre 1814.

Monsieur le comte,

Nous avons l'honneur de vous adresser les copies des procès-verbaux
des deux premières conférences qui ont eu lieu.

Les notes qui y sont mentionnées, et sur lesquelles une délibération a
eu lieu, sont celles présentées par l'ambassade de France, et envoyées
par la dernière dépêche au département.

Une troisième conférence s'est tenue le 1er novembre. M. le comte de
Noailles, arrivé le matin, y a assisté.

Le résultat n'a pas été important; on a même hésité jusqu'ici à le
consigner dans un procès-verbal.

Le prince de Metternich, en sa qualité de président, a établi, dans un
discours singulièrement diffus et très décousu, «qu'il fallait, avant
de procéder à la formation des comités et des commissions, s'être
entendu, et que chaque puissance ait réglé avec les autres ce qui
l'intéresse directement».

Il nous a dit encore:

«Que toutes les affaires avaient deux faces; que ce congrès n'était
pas un congrès; que son ouverture n'était pas proprement une
ouverture; que les commissions n'étaient pas des commissions; que,
dans la réunion des puissances à Vienne, il ne fallait considérer que
l'avantage _d'une Europe sans distances_; qu'on resterait d'accord, ou
qu'on ne le serait pas.»

M. de Metternich a donné dans cette séance la mesure de sa médiocrité,
de son goût pour les petites intrigues et pour une marche incertaine
et tortueuse, et de sa fécondité en mots vagues et vides de sens.

En voici un exemple entre mille: il nomme les commissions _des chances
de négociations_. Il eût été inutile de relever l'inconvenance d'un
pareil discours.

On était prévenu que les négociations relatives aux grandes et
principales questions avaient pris une meilleure tournure; on voulait
en attendre la confirmation et soigneusement éviter d'augmenter les
difficultés qui entravent la marche des affaires.

La majorité dans cette conférence est tombée d'accord de gagner du
temps, et de conférer une autre fois sur la possibilité et les formes
d'une convocation générale du congrès.

La question de la Pologne, et par suite celle de la Saxe, sont, en
attendant, fortement engagées.

L'empereur de Russie, nous assure-t-on, a répondu aux ministres
anglais. La note rédigée par M. d'Anstedt[328] a été peu satisfaisante
et doit être conçue dans un esprit assez peu conciliant.

  [328] Jean, baron d'Anstedt, diplomate russe, né à Strasbourg en
  1760. En 1789, il se rendit en Russie et se fit attacher au
  département des affaires étrangères. Il fut plusieurs fois
  accrédité à Vienne comme chargé d'affaires. En 1811, il devint
  directeur de la chancellerie diplomatique du prince Koutousoff. Il
  représenta la Russie au congrès de Prague (1813), alla ensuite à
  Vienne (1814) et fut ensuite plénipotentiaire russe près la diète
  de Francfort. Il mourut en 1835.

Lord Castlereagh y a répondu hier. On nous dit qu'il insiste, au nom
de l'Angleterre, et pour la sûreté de l'Europe, sur ce que la Russie
ne passe pas la Vistule.

Le prince de Metternich a été obligé de soutenir cette question depuis
que l'empereur, son maître, a soumis cet objet à la délibération d'un
conseil d'État, qui, dans ses conclusions, a décidé: «Que la Russie ne
pouvait s'étendre plus loin sans menacer la sûreté des positions
militaires de l'Autriche, et qu'il était encore plus important pour
l'Allemagne d'empêcher que _les défilés de la Saale_[329] soient dans
les mains de la Prusse.»

  [329] La Saale prend sa source en Bavière, traverse toute la Saxe
  et se jette dans l'Elbe. C'est par les défilés de la Saale que
  passa Napoléon dans la campagne de 1806.

Les instructions supplémentaires du roi, apportées par M. de Noailles,
avaient mis ses plénipotentiaires dans la possibilité de faire des
insinuations sur la part active que la France prendrait pour obtenir
un équilibre réel et durable, et pour empocher que la Russie ne
s'emparât du grand-duché de Varsovie, et la Prusse, de la Saxe.

On en avait prévenu le ministre de Bavière, et on avait trouvé moyen
de le porter à la connaissance directe de l'empereur d'Autriche. Nous
croyons que cela fortifiera le prince de Metternich dans la résistance
qu'il doit opposer aux prétentions de la Russie et de la Prusse. Déjà
le langage ferme et décidé que l'ambassade a tenu dès le premier
moment l'a forcé à soutenir avec plus d'énergie ces grands intérêts de
l'Europe. On assure généralement que ces deux puissances (la Russie et
la Prusse) s'éclairent sur les difficultés qu'elles trouveront à
réussir dans leurs différents projets. L'influence que les ministres
anglais exercent également sur ces questions, nous fait espérer
qu'elles seront modifiées, que le roi aura la gloire d'avoir arrêté
l'exécution des plans les plus funestes pour l'Europe et pour sa
tranquillité future.

Lord Castlereagh, à la vérité, se montre toujours enclin à procurer la
Saxe à la Prusse; mais cette dernière puissance réfléchira qu'elle ne
peut la posséder tranquillement sans le concours de la France, et
préférera peut-être s'arranger par d'autres combinaisons.

Le prince de Hardenberg est convenu avec un de ses amis qu'il croyait
cette réunion de la Saxe très odieuse à l'Allemagne et que la Prusse
consentirait peut-être à en laisser _un noyau_.

L'Autriche paraît vouloir que ce noyau soit composé des _trois quarts_
de la Saxe, si on arrête la limite de la Russie sur la Vistule. La
Saxe conserverait alors quinze à seize cent mille habitants et
resterait plus grande que le Wurtemberg et le Hanovre.

Ce résultat serait bien au delà des espérances qu'on aurait pu
concevoir à l'époque où les plénipotentiaires de France sont arrivés
au congrès, et le roi aura eu par ses propres moyens un succès bien
remarquable, si les choses se terminent ainsi.

Les arrangements fédératifs de l'Allemagne continuent à se traiter
avec mystère. La Bavière y soutient la lutte contre la Prusse et ne
veut sacrifier de ses droits de souveraineté que ce qui sera
nécessaire pour la formation de la ligue.

Les échanges de territoires n'ont pas encore pu être traités, parce
que tout dépend des limites de la Prusse.

Il reste maintenant deux autres masses d'intérêts politiques à régler,
et on paraît vouloir s'en occuper: ce sont les affaires du corps
helvétique et celles d'Italie.

M. le prince de Metternich a jugé hier à propos d'inviter M. le prince
de Talleyrand à une conférence où se trouvaient lord Castlereagh et M.
le comte de Nesselrode. On y a parlé de ces deux objets.

Ces messieurs ont fait part au prince de Talleyrand de ce qu'une
commission avait été nommée pour arranger, avec les députés suisses
présents à Vienne, les affaires du corps helvétique. M. le prince de
Talleyrand a dit qu'il avait nommé M. de Dalberg pour conférer sur le
concours que la France avait à exercer dans cette affaire.

Quant à celles d'Italie, l'embarras de M. de Metternich a été visible
lorsqu'il a été question de Naples. On doit l'attribuer à la crainte
que lui inspirent la situation des esprits et le peu de goût des
Italiens pour la domination autrichienne, et à l'influence que Murat
exerce sur les jacobins de l'Italie, particulièrement sur ceux de
l'ancien royaume d'Italie, dont il a été autrefois gouverneur.

Le prince de Talleyrand a proposé, pour paralyser cette influence, de
ne toucher au sort de Murat que lorsque les autres rapports de
l'Italie seraient arrangés, qu'on y aurait fait cesser le régime
provisoire et qu'on l'aurait organisée dans un ordre géographique, en
commençant par les parties septentrionales.

Le prince de Metternich est convenu qu'on ne pouvait, dans les
affaires d'Italie, écarter les droits du royaume d'Étrurie, mais qu'il
désirait qu'une ou deux légations fussent données à l'archiduchesse
Marie-Louise et à son fils. Les autres ministres, croyant que ces
légations étaient des biens vacants par suite du traité de Tolentino,
ont trouvé juste de compenser la perte de Parme par un équivalent.

Comme dans les affaires d'Italie la France cherche à obtenir trois
points, savoir: la succession de la maison de Carignan au trône de
Sardaigne, le rétablissement de la maison de Parme et l'expulsion de
Murat, il faudra ne pas élever trop de difficultés. Le prince de
Talleyrand n'a point relevé cette question. Mais on peut croire que
les affaires d'Italie s'arrangeront sur ces bases générales.

Le prince de Talleyrand a désigné pour la commission qui sera formée
et devra s'occuper de cet objet plus en détail M. de Noailles, auquel
il a fait connaître les intentions du roi.

Quant aux affaires de la Suisse, lord Castlereagh aurait désiré
écarter la concurrence de la France; mais le député de Berne[330] a
déclaré que ses instructions l'exigeaient impérativement et que son
gouvernement, aussi bien que celui de Soleure et de Fribourg, ne
croyaient pas que les intérêts de la Suisse pussent être réglés sans
l'intervention de la France. Le ministre de Russie, M. Capo
d'Istria[331] et M. Canning[332] paraissent avoir opiné dans le même
sens. La défiance et la jalousie des autres puissances seront donc
vaincues sur ce point, et nous pensons que les arrangements de la
Suisse ne souffriront pas beaucoup de difficultés.

  [330] Louis Zerdeler (1772-1840), membre du grand conseil dans le
  canton de Berne après l'acte de médiation, fut ministre à
  Pétersbourg et plénipotentiaire au congrès de Vienne. Il se démit
  de ses fonctions en 1815.

  [331] Jean, comte Capo d'Istria, né à Corfou en 1776. A vingt-sept
  ans il fut choisi pour secrétaire d'État par le commissaire
  impérial de Russie dans les îles Ioniennes. Lorsque la paix de
  Tilsitt plaça ces îles sous la domination de la France, Capo
  d'Istria se démit de ses fonctions et se rendit à Pétersbourg où il
  entra dans les bureaux du ministère des affaires étrangères. En
  1813, il fut chargé d'une mission secrète en Suisse, pour faire
  respecter la neutralité de cet État. Plénipotentiaire au congrès de
  Vienne il devint l'année suivante secrétaire d'État aux affaires
  étrangères. Dès ce moment la Grèce commençait à s'agiter; la
  situation de Capo d'Istria, grec d'origine et ministre du czar,
  devenait difficile. Il fut, en effet, destitué en 1819, au moment
  de l'insurrection d'Ypsilanti. Il vivait retiré à Genève depuis
  huit ans, lorsqu'il fut nommé par ses compatriotes président de la
  Grèce (1827). Il accepta ces fonctions et les conserva quatre ans.
  Il fut assassiné en 1831.

  [332] Sir Stratford Canning, né en 1786, diplomate anglais, parent
  du célèbre ministre de ce nom. En 1814, il était ministre
  plénipotentiaire en Suisse, et fut accrédité au congrès de Vienne.
  En 1824, il devint ambassadeur à Pétersbourg, puis à Constantinople
  (1827). En 1832, il entra à la Chambre des communes, retourna à
  Constantinople en 1842 et, avec quelques interruptions, y résida
  jusqu'en 1858. Il revint alors en Angleterre où il vécut jusqu'à sa
  mort (1880).

Le canton de Berne désire reprendre la partie du canton d'Argovie qui
lui avait appartenu; le canton de Zurich, par l'effet d'une ancienne
jalousie, ne veut y consentir qu'à condition d'en obtenir lui-même une
partie. On voit ici la question des droits légitimes luttant contre un
système de convenance, tel qu'on l'observe en Allemagne dans la
question de la Saxe. Les puissances paraissent disposées à donner au
canton de Berne l'évêché de Bâle. Il se présente à ce sujet une
question qui doit être soumise à la décision immédiate du roi.

Le canton de Genève cherche à obtenir dix à douze mille âmes du pays
de Gex[333], pour être immédiatement lié au canton de Vaud. On
offrirait en échange à la France le double de population pris sur
l'évêché de Bâle, et la frontière militaire entre Huningue, Vesoul et
Besançon se trouverait améliorée.

  [333] La France possédait alors la partie du pays de Gex baignée
  par le lac de Genève, avec la ville de Versoix. C'était ce
  territoire qui était convoité par le canton de Genève.

La France ne perdrait que le point qui la conduit sur le lac de
Genève, et on pourrait stipuler qu'elle y conserverait la liberté de
navigation et de commerce.

Cet échange, qui nous paraît avantageux, nécessiterait cependant le
retour d'une partie de l'Argovie[334] au canton de Berne, l'évêché de
Bâle se trouvant alors fort diminué. Mais, tout avantage qu'on pourra
procurer au canton de Berne est, pour ainsi dire, donné à la France,
ce canton tenant à elle et à la maison de Bourbon par les sentiments
d'attachement et de dévouement les plus forts.

  [334] Aarau, Brugg, Lenzbourg et Zofingen avec leur territoire.

Nous observons également que l'empereur de Russie veut, si cet échange
n'a pas lieu, envelopper le canton de Genève par une partie de la
Savoie, qui tourne autour du lac de Genève, vers le Valais. Cet
échange servirait par conséquent à écarter cette idée.

Vous voudrez bien, monsieur le comte, nous transmettre les ordres du
roi le plus tôt possible, et nous les transmettre avec toutes les
modifications qu'il plaira à Sa Majesté d'y faire. Si elle consent à
cet échange, il signalera le désir de la France de concourir à tout ce
qui peut être avantageux au corps helvétique; et, au dire des députés
suisses, de celui de Berne même, elle y regagnera une influence
prépondérante. Le prince de Talleyrand croit voir qu'il y aurait de
l'avantage à faire cet échange, mais il nous faut une autorisation.

Nº 10.--LE PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND AU ROI LOUIS XVIII.

Vienne, le 6 novembre 1814.

SIRE,

M. le comte de Noailles, arrivé ici mercredi matin 2 novembre, m'a
apporté le supplément d'instructions que Votre Majesté a bien voulu me
faire adresser. Les résolutions de Votre Majesté sont maintenant
connues du cabinet autrichien, de l'empereur d'Autriche lui-même et de
la Bavière. J'ai cru plus utile de n'en point parler encore à lord
Castlereagh, toujours prompt à s'alarmer d'une intervention de la
France, et je n'en ai pu parler au comte de Munster, qui, à peine
sorti des mains de ses médecins, fait les préparatifs de son mariage
avec la comtesse de la Lippe, soeur du prince régnant de Buckeburg.

M. le comte de Noailles a pu, dès le jour de son arrivée, assister à
une conférence qui a fini sans résultat. Il s'agissait d'examiner si,
la vérification des pouvoirs une fois terminée, on nommerait des
commissions pour préparer les travaux, combien on en nommerait,
comment et par qui elles seraient nommées. M. de Metternich a fait un
long discours pour établir que le nom de _commission_ ne pouvait pas
convenir, parce qu'il supposait une délégation de pouvoirs, laquelle
supposait à son tour une assemblée délibérante, ce que le congrès ne
pouvait pas être. Il a proposé diverses expressions à la place de
celle dont il ne voulait pas, et, n'étant lui-même satisfait d'aucune,
il a conclu qu'il en faudrait chercher une autre dans la prochaine
conférence qui n'a point encore eu lieu. Ces scrupules sur le nom de
_commission_ étaient sans doute étranges et bien tardifs après que
l'on n'avait pas fait difficulté de le donner aux trois ministres
chargés de vérifier les pouvoirs et aux cinq qui préparent
l'organisation politique de l'Allemagne. Mais si j'avais pu croire,
que M. de Metternich avait une autre intention que de chercher un
prétexte pour gagner du temps, j'en aurais été détrompé par lui-même.

Après la conférence, il me proposa d'entrer dans son cabinet et me dit
que lord Castlereagh et lui étaient décidés à ne point souffrir que la
Russie dépassât la ligne de la Vistule; qu'ils travaillaient à engager
la Prusse à faire cause commune avec eux sur cette question, et qu'ils
espéraient y réussir. Il me conjura de leur en laisser le temps et de
ne pas les presser. Je voulus savoir à quelles conditions ils se
flattaient d'obtenir le concours de la Prusse. Il me répondit que
c'était en lui promettant une portion de la Saxe, c'est-à-dire quatre
à cinq cent mille âmes de ce pays, et particulièrement la place et le
cercle de Wittemberg, qui peuvent être considérés comme nécessaires
pour couvrir Berlin, de sorte que le royaume de Saxe conserverait
encore de quinze à seize cent mille âmes, Torgau, Koenigstein et le
cours de l'Elbe, depuis le cercle de Wittemberg jusqu'à la Bohême.

J'ai su que, dans un conseil d'État présidé par l'empereur lui-même et
composé de M. de Stadion, du prince de Schwarzenberg et du prince de
Metternich, ainsi que du comte de Zichy et du général Duka[335], il a
été établi en principe que la question de la Saxe était encore d'un
plus grand intérêt pour l'Autriche que celle même de la Pologne, et
qu'il allait du salut de la monarchie à[336] ne point laisser tomber
entre les mains de la Prusse les défilés de la Thuringe et de la
Saale. (J'entre dans plus de détails sur cet objet dans ma lettre de
ce jour, adressée au département.)

  [335] Pierre, comte Duka, né en 1756, feld-zeugmeister et
  conseiller privé de l'empire d'Autriche, mort en 1822.

  [336] Variante: _de ne_ point.

Cette circonstance m'a fait prendre un peu plus de confiance dans ce
que m'avait dit à ce sujet M. de Metternich que je ne le fais
ordinairement. Si l'on parvient à conserver le royaume de Saxe avec
les quatre cinquièmes ou les trois quarts de sa population actuelle et
ses principales places et positions militaires, nous aurons beaucoup
fait pour la justice, beaucoup pour l'utilité et beaucoup aussi pour
la gloire de Votre Majesté.

L'empereur de Russie a répondu au mémoire de lord Castlereagh. Je
verrai sa réponse, et j'aurai l'honneur d'en parler à Votre Majesté
plus pertinemment que par des _on dit_ dans ma première dépêche. Je
sais seulement d'une manière sûre que l'empereur se plaint de
l'injustice qu'il prétend qu'on lui fait en lui supposant une ambition
qui n'est pas dans son coeur. Il se représente, en quelque sorte, comme
opprimé, et, sans trop de transition, il arrive à déclarer qu'il ne se
désistera d'aucune de ses prétentions.

Lord Castlereagh, qui a pris feu sur cette réponse, a fait une
réplique que lord Stewart a dû porter hier. Son frère l'a chargé de
cette commission, parce qu'il a eu pendant la guerre, et conservé
depuis, ses entrées chez l'empereur Alexandre.

M. de Gentz, qui a traduit cette pièce pour le cabinet autrichien, à
qui elle a été communiquée, m'a dit qu'elle était très forte et très
bonne.

Les affaires de Suisse vont être mises en mouvement. J'ai fait choix
de M. de Dalberg pour prendre part aux conférences où elles seront
discutées. Je ne répète pas à Votre Majesté tout ce qui s'est passé à
cet égard; ma dépêche au département lui en rend compte.

Hier, à quatre heures, je me suis rendu chez M. de Metternich, qui
m'avait prié de passer chez lui. J'y trouvai M. de Nesselrode et lord
Castlereagh. M. de Metternich débuta par de grandes protestations de
vouloir être en confiance avec moi, de s'entendre avec la France et de
ne rien faire sans nous[337]. Ce qu'ils désiraient, disait-il, c'était
que, mettant de côté toute susceptibilité, je voulusse les aider à
avancer les affaires et à sortir de l'embarras où il avoua qu'ils se
trouvaient. Je répondis que la situation dans laquelle ils étaient
vis-à-vis de moi était tout autre que la mienne vis-à-vis d'eux; que
je ne voulais, ne faisais, ne savais rien qu'ils ne connussent et ne
sussent comme moi-même; qu'eux, au contraire, avaient fait et
faisaient journellement une foule de choses que j'ignorais, ou que, si
je venais à en apprendre quelques-unes, c'était par des bruits de
ville; que c'était ainsi que j'avais appris qu'il existait une réponse
de l'empereur Alexandre à lord Castlereagh. (Ici[338], je vis que je
l'embarrassais, et je compris que, devant M. de Nesselrode, il ne
voulait pas paraître avoir fait à cet égard quelque indiscrétion.) Je
me hâtai d'ajouter que je ne savais point ce que portait cette
réponse, ni même s'il y en avait réellement une. Puis, je remarquai
que, quant aux difficultés dont ils se plaignaient, je ne pouvais les
attribuer qu'à une seule cause, à ce qu'ils n'avaient point réuni le
congrès. «Il faudra bien, leur dis-je, qu'on le réunisse un jour ou
l'autre. Plus on tarde et plus on semble s'accuser soi-même d'avoir
des vues que l'on n'ose montrer au grand jour. Tant de délais
sembleront indiquer une mauvaise conscience; pourquoi feriez-vous
difficulté de déclarer que, sans attendre la vérification des
pouvoirs, qui peut être longue, tous ceux qui ont remis les leurs à la
chancellerie d'État devront se réunir dans un lieu indiqué? Les
commissions y seront annoncées; il sera dit que chacun pourra y porter
ses demandes, et on se séparera. Les commissions feront alors leur
travail, et les affaires marcheront avec une sorte de régularité.»
Lord Castlereagh approuva cette marche, qui avait pour lui le mérite
d'écarter la difficulté relative aux pouvoirs contestés. Mais il
observa que le mot seul de _congrès_ épouvantait les Prussiens, et que
le prince de Hardenberg surtout en avait une frayeur horrible. M. de
Metternich reproduisit la plupart des raisonnements qu'il nous avait
faits dans la dernière conférence. Il trouvait préférable de ne réunir
le congrès que quand on serait d'accord, du moins sur toutes les
grandes questions. Il y en a une, dit-il, sur laquelle on est en
présence. Il indiquait la question de Pologne, mais ne voulut point la
nommer; et il passa promptement aux affaires de l'Allemagne proprement
dites. «Tout est, dit-il, dans le meilleur accord entre les personnes
qui s'en occupent. On va aussi s'occuper des affaires de la Suisse,
qui ne doivent pas, ajouta-t-il, se régler sans que la France y prenne
part.» Je lui dis que j'avais pensé qu'ils ne pouvaient[339] pas
avoir une autre intention et que j'avais, en conséquence, choisi M. de
Dalberg pour assister aux conférences qui seraient tenues à ce sujet.
De là, passant aux affaires d'Italie, le mot de _complication_ dont M.
de Metternich se sert perpétuellement pour se tenir dans le vague dont
sa faible politique a besoin, fut employé depuis les affaires de Gênes
et de Turin jusqu'à celles de Naples et de Sicile. Il voulait arriver
à prouver que la tranquillité de l'Italie et par suite celle de
l'Europe, tenaient à ce que l'affaire de Naples ne fût pas réglée au
congrès, mais à ce qu'elle fût remise à une époque plus éloignée. «La
force des choses, disait-il, ramènera nécessairement la maison de
Bourbon sur le trône de Naples.--La force des choses, lui dis-je, me
paraît maintenant dans toute sa puissance. C'est au congrès que cette
question doit finir. Dans l'ordre géographique, cette question se
présente la dernière de celles de l'Italie, et je consens à ce que
l'ordre géographique soit suivi: mais ma condescendance ne peut aller
plus loin[340].» M. de Metternich parla alors des partisans que Murat
avait en Italie. «Organisez l'Italie, il n'en aura plus. Faites cesser
un provisoire odieux; fixez l'état de possession dans la haute et
moyenne Italie; que des Alpes aux frontières de Naples il n'y ait pas
un seul coin de terre sous l'occupation militaire; qu'il y ait partout
des souverains légitimes et une administration régulière; fixez la
succession de Sardaigne, envoyez dans le Milanais un archiduc pour
l'administrer; reconnaissez les droits de la reine d'Étrurie; rendez
au pape ce qui lui appartient et que vous occupez; Murat[341] n'aura
plus aucune prise sur l'esprit des peuples, il ne sera pour l'Italie
qu'un brigand.» Cette marche géographique pour traiter des affaires
d'Italie a paru convenir, et on s'est décidé à appeler M. de
Saint-Marsan[342] à la prochaine conférence, pour régler avec lui,
conformément à ce plan, les affaires de la Sardaigne. On doit aussi
entendre M. de Brignole[343], député de la ville de Gênes, sur ce qui
concerne les intérêts commerciaux de cette ville. Lord Castlereagh
insiste beaucoup pour que Gênes soit un port franc, et il a, à cette
occasion, parlé avec approbation et amertume de la franchise de celui
de Marseille.

  [341] Variante: _et alors_ Murat.

  [342] Antoine Asinari, marquis de Saint-Marsan, homme d'État sarde,
  né à Turin en 1761 d'une ancienne famille originaire du Languedoc.
  En 1796, il devint ministre de la guerre et de la marine. Lorsque
  le Piémont fut réuni à la France, M. de Saint-Marsan fut nommé
  conseiller d'État par Napoléon, et ministre de France à Berlin. En
  1813, il revint à Paris et fut nommé sénateur. En 1814, M. de
  Saint-Marsan fut placé par les souverains alliés à la tête du
  gouvernement provisoire de Turin. Le roi Victor Emmanuel, à son
  retour, le nomma ministre de la guerre et plénipotentiaire au
  congrès de Vienne. En 1816, il devint ministre des affaires
  étrangères, puis président du conseil en 1818. Il se retira en 1821
  et mourut en 1828.

  [343] Antoine, marquis de Brignole-Sales, issu d'une ancienne et
  illustre famille de Gênes. Né en 1786, il fut d'abord auditeur au
  conseil d'État impérial et, plus tard, préfet de Savone. En 1814,
  il fut envoyé au congrès comme plénipotentiaire par la ville de
  Gênes. Il se rallia à la monarchie de Savoie, devint chef de
  l'université royale (1816), ambassadeur à Rome (1839), puis à
  Paris, ministre d'État et sénateur. Il mourut en 1863.

Nous pourrions croire que notre situation tend à s'améliorer un peu,
mais je n'ose me fier à aucune apparence, n'ayant que trop de raisons
de ne point compter sur la sincérité de M. de Metternich. De plus, je
ne sais quelle idée il faut attacher au départ inattendu du grand-duc
Constantin, qui quitte Vienne après-demain pour se rendre directement
à Varsovie.

On parle d'un voyage que l'empereur Alexandre doit faire à Grätz, _en
Styrie_[344]. On dit qu'il se propose d'aller jusqu'à Trieste. Un des
archiducs doit lui faire les honneurs de cette partie de la monarchie
autrichienne. Ce voyage est annoncé pour le 20.

La cour de Vienne continue à exercer envers ses nobles hôtes une
hospitalité, qui, dans l'état de ses finances, lui doit être fort à
charge. On ne voit partout qu'empereurs, rois, impératrices, reines,
princes héréditaires, princes régnants. La cour défraye tout le monde.
On estime la dépense de chaque jour à deux cent vingt mille florins en
papier. La royauté perd certainement à ces réunions quelque chose de
la grandeur qui lui est propre. Trouver trois ou quatre rois et
davantage de princes à des bals, à des thés chez de simples
particuliers[345] me paraît bien inconvenable. Il faudra venir en
France pour voir à la royauté cet éclat et cette dignité qui la
rendent à la fois auguste et chère aux yeux des peuples.

Nº 6 _ter_.--LE ROI LOUIS XVIII AU PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND.

Paris, le 9 novembre 1814.

Mon cousin,

J'ai reçu votre numéro 9.

Je vois avec quelque satisfaction que le congrès tend à s'ouvrir, mais
je prévois encore bien des difficultés.

Je charge le comte de Blacas de vous informer:

1º D'un entretien qu'il a eu avec le duc de Wellington[346]; vous
verrez que celui-ci tient un langage bien plus explicite que lord
Castlereagh. Qui des deux parle d'après les véritables intentions de
sa cour? Je l'ignore; mais le dire de lord Wellington sera dans tous
les cas[347] une bonne arme entre vos mains;

2º D'une pièce que cet ambassadeur assure être authentique; rien ne
peut m'étonner de la part du prince de Metternich, mais je serais
surpris que, le 31 octobre, vous n'eussiez pas encore _eu_[348]
connaissance d'un pareil fait. Quoi qu'il en puisse être, il était
également nécessaire que vous en fussiez instruit.

  [346] Le duc de Wellington était alors ambassadeur à Paris. Il fut
  ensuite accrédité à Vienne comme plénipotentiaire au congrès du 1er
  février au 26 mars 1815.

  [347] Variante: mais _le duc de Wellington_ sera dans tous les cas.

Vous apprendrez avec plaisir que mon frère est arrivé ici dimanche en
très bonne santé. Sur quoi, je prie Dieu qu'il vous ait, mon cousin,
en sa sainte et digne garde.

Nº II.--LE COMTE DE BLACAS D'AULPS AU PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND.

Paris, le 9 novembre 1814.

J'exécute, mon prince, un ordre du roi, en m'empressant de vous
transmettre de la part de Sa Majesté des informations importantes et
des instructions qu'elle ne juge pas moins essentielles.

Votre nouvelle entrevue avec l'empereur de Russie et, plus encore, vos
craintes sur la condescendance de l'Autriche et de l'Angleterre, ont
fait désirer vivement au roi de recueillir tout ce qui pourrait
l'éclairer sur les dispositions réelles de cette dernière puissance.
Ce qui vous avait été rapporté du langage que tenait M. le prince
régent, et ce que Sa Majesté savait elle-même à cet égard, lui
faisaient envisager comme bien nécessaire de sonder les intentions du
cabinet britannique.

Une conversation que je viens d'avoir avec le duc de Wellington a
rempli ce but, ou du moins a fourni au roi l'occasion d'invoquer plus
fortement que jamais le concours de l'Angleterre sur les points les
plus épineux de la négociation. Lord Wellington, après m'avoir assuré
que les instructions données à lord Castlereagh, et _qu'il
connaissait_, étaient absolument opposées aux desseins de l'empereur
Alexandre sur la Pologne, et par conséquent sur la Saxe, puisque le
sort de la Saxe dépend absolument de la détermination qui sera prise à
l'égard de la Pologne, m'a dit qu'en s'attachant uniquement à cette
grande question et négligeant tous les intérêts secondaires, on
parviendrait aisément à s'entendre. Suivant lui, l'Autriche ne donnera
point les mains au projet que la France rejette, et la Prusse
elle-même, pour qui la Saxe est un _pis aller_, se verrait avec une
extrême satisfaction réintégrée dans le duché de Varsovie. Trouvant le
duc de Wellington tellement explicite[349] sur ce point, j'ai cru,
d'après les intentions du roi, devoir tenter une ouverture qui, bien
que dépourvue de tout caractère officiel, pouvait de plus en plus
l'engager dans la communication des seules vues que voulût avouer la
cour de Londres. Je lui ai représenté que si les dispositions de son
gouvernement étaient telles qu'il me le disait, et que le seul
obstacle à une prompte et heureuse issue des négociations fût dans la
difficulté de réduire à une résistance uniforme des oppositions d'une
nature différente, il me semblait qu'une convention conclue entre la
France, l'Angleterre, l'Espagne et la Hollande, et qui n'aurait pour
but que la manifestation des vues qu'elles adoptent conjointement sur
cette question, obtiendrait bientôt l'assentiment des autres cours. Ce
moyen, en présentant un concours imposant de volontés, devait
sur-le-champ dissoudre le charme qui entraînait tant d'États dans une
direction contraire à leurs intérêts, et le roi, n'ayant d'autre
ambition que le rétablissement des principes du droit public et d'un
juste équilibre en Europe, pouvait se flatter qu'aucun motif
n'écarterait de sa politique ceux qui, animés des mêmes sentiments,
seraient invités à s'y rallier.

  [349] Variante: _Le trouvant tellement explicite_.

Cette proposition, dont le duc de Wellington n'a pu entièrement
méconnaître l'avantage, a été rejetée par lui comme superflue; mais il
ne m'en a protesté qu'avec plus de force des intentions droites de son
gouvernement sur la question de Pologne et de Saxe, et même sur celle
de Naples, et il m'a répété qu'une attention exclusive portée à ces
grands intérêts amènerait bientôt les plénipotentiaires au but dont
s'écarte la cour de Pétersbourg.

Vous voyez, prince, que l'Angleterre (quelles que soient les
réticences de son négociateur au congrès) reconnaît hautement ici la
nature des instructions dont il est porteur, instructions qui, en
liant[350], ainsi que l'a fait le duc de Wellington, la question de
la Saxe à celle de la Pologne[351], offrent au roi l'appui le plus
important. Dans cet état de choses, Sa Majesté pense que vous pouvez
utilement vous prévaloir des informations que j'ai l'honneur de vous
adresser. En invoquant les instructions de lord Castlereagh, vous êtes
ainsi autorisé à le placer dans la nécessité de vous faire une réponse
qu'il lui sera difficile de rendre négative, lorsqu'un jour il sera
forcé de prouver que sa conduite a été conforme aux vues de son
gouvernement et à l'intérêt de son pays.

  [350] Variante: _lorsqu'on lie_.

  [351] Variante: _la question de la Pologne à celle de la Saxe_.

L'indépendance de la Pologne, très populaire en Angleterre, si elle
était complète, ne le serait[352] nullement comme le projette la
Russie. Vous jugerez donc, sans doute, prince, qu'il est très
important, dans vos rapports avec le ministre anglais, de distinguer
ces deux hypothèses. Le roi est persuadé que plus vous exprimerez de
voeux en faveur d'une indépendance réelle et entière de la nation
polonaise, en cas que cela fût praticable, et plus vous ôterez à lord
Castlereagh les moyens de justifier aux yeux de l'Angleterre[353]
l'abandon du grand-duché de Varsovie à l'empereur Alexandre.

  [352] Variante: ne _le sera_.

  [353] Variante: _de la nation anglaise_.

Le roi vous a fait connaître les ordres que Sa Majesté a
donnés[354] au ministre de la guerre pour porter l'armée au complet
du pied de paix[355].

  [354] Variante: _vous a instruit des ordres que Sa Majesté avait
  donnés_.

  [355] Variante: _Je me flatte que cette détermination dictée par
  les considérations dont vous sentez toute la force ne tardera pas à
  devenir superflue_.

_La pièce que je joins ici par ordre du roi, et qui m'a été
communiquée comme authentique, prouve combien cette mesure était
nécessaire au milieu de tous les écueils qui nous entourent. Rien ne
peut surprendre de la part du prince de Metternich, mais il serait

Nº 12 _bis_.--LES AMBASSADEURS DU ROI AU CONGRÈS, AU MINISTRE DES
AFFAIRES ÉTRANGÈRES A PARIS.

Vienne, le 12 novembre 1814.

Monsieur le comte,

Tous les renseignements particuliers qui nous reviennent nous font
présumer que les questions de Pologne et de Saxe ne sont point
améliorées, et qu'elles restent soumises à une aveugle obstination de
la part de l'empereur de Russie et du roi de Prusse, et à un abandon
funeste de la part de l'Autriche.

Un courrier du roi de Saxe, parti de Berlin le 5, a apporté une
protestation formelle qui nous a été communiquée. Cette déclaration
porte que le roi ne consentira à aucun échange et qu'il n'abdiquera
jamais. Son intention est que cette déclaration soit rendue publique.
Nous pensons qu'elle ne peut produire qu'un très bon effet et
probablement nous vous l'adresserons par le prochain courrier pour
être insérée dans le _Moniteur_. Le roi de Saxe refuse, depuis
l'établissement provisoire d'une administration prussienne, toute
espèce de traitement qui lui avait été assigné, et l'a fait savoir au
gouvernement prussien.

En attendant, le grand-duc Constantin est parti pour Varsovie. Il
porte, à ce qu'on assure, les instructions pour organiser cette
nouvelle Pologne, qui, insignifiante par elle-même, sera une source de
troubles pour ses voisins. L'Autriche en est alarmée; son cabinet
paraît vouloir épuiser tous les moyens pour détourner l'empereur de
Russie de ses projets, et détacher de lui le roi de Prusse. Incertaine
cependant de réussir, elle a pris le parti de faire marcher à peu près
vingt à vingt-cinq mille hommes sur la Gallicie. Ces troupes doivent
renforcer le cordon qu'elle avait sur cette frontière; mais l'Autriche
ne paraît pas vouloir s'opposer par le moyen des armes à
l'envahissement de la Saxe.

Le prince de Metternich a expédié un courrier à Londres. Il est
probable qu'il porte l'ordre à M. le comte de Meerveldt de représenter
au cabinet britannique combien il importe de soutenir fortement l'avis
qu'a donné lord Castlereagh dans ses notes à l'empereur de Russie. Ce
ministre veut que le grand-duché de Varsovie reste indépendant, ou que
la Vistule soit la frontière entre la Russie, la Prusse et l'Autriche.
C'est sur ces bases que les trois puissances négocient encore.
L'empereur Alexandre, cependant, est décidé à faire un pas de plus
pour atteindre son but, et il entraîne le roi de Prusse, auquel il a
donné le conseil de commencer l'organisation de la Saxe, tandis qu'il
commence celle du duché de Varsovie.

Cette conduite laisse en Europe un germe de guerre qu'on ne saurait
écarter dans ce moment. Elle fournira les éléments à de longues
agitations, et rend fort difficile la conclusion des affaires de
l'Allemagne.

On a, par suite de la dernière conférence particulière, repris les
affaires qui concernent l'Italie.

Le cabinet autrichien est d'autant plus disposé à les terminer que la
fermentation jacobine qui se montre dans cette partie de l'Europe, et
qui est protégée par Murat, l'inquiète. Cette fermentation est
soutenue par la Russie et par les Anglais. Lord William Bentinck[357]
a semé dans ces pays des idées de révolution qui devaient servir
contre Bonaparte et qui gênent dans l'ordre de choses actuel.

  [357] On se rappelle que lord Bentinck avait, durant plusieurs
  années, commandé un corps de troupes anglaises en Sicile.

La réunion de Gênes au Piémont se fera, à ce que nous croyons, en
vertu d'une capitulation. Les Génois avaient présenté le projet d'une
constitution qui, par son esprit démocratique, ne pouvait être admis.
Mais la capitulation est d'autant plus nécessaire que les Génois
répugnent singulièrement à cet acte de soumission et qu'il est bon
d'écarter partout autant qu'on le pourra les germes d'aigreur et de
discorde qui se multiplient sur tous les points à l'occasion de la
réunion des Belges aux Hollandais, des Saxons aux Prussiens, des
Italiens aux Autrichiens.

Nous sommes fondés à espérer de faire rendre Parme à la famille
d'Espagne, et de faire donner _une des légations_ à l'archiduchesse
Marie-Louise. Si cet échange peut être obtenu, on en proposera le
retour au Saint-Siège dans le cas où le prince son fils mourrait sans
enfants. On n'a pas encore parlé du sort de Murat; mais l'ambassade du
roi ne regardera aucun arrangement comme complet, si la retraite de
Murat n'y est stipulée.

Les affaires de Suisse n'ont point encore été touchées. On croit que
les alliés avaient le projet de lier les rapports de ce pays avec le
système militaire de l'Allemagne, pour opposer de plus fortes
barrières à la France. La nomination de M. de Stein, de la part de la
Russie, comme commissaire délégué pour cet objet, ferait peut-être
supposer quelques arrière-pensées. Mais cet arrangement serait
tellement contraire aux intérêts des Suisses, qu'on peut s'en
rapporter à eux-mêmes pour le voir écarter lorsqu'il en sera question.

Vous jugerez, monsieur le comte, par ce court exposé des occupations
du congrès que les résultats n'y sont pas fort avancés; mais que les
intrigues particulières ont continué d'être assez actives. De la part
des puissances elles découlent de deux sources: l'effroi que leur
inspire encore la France révolutionnaire, et le désir secret qu'elles
nourrissent de voir la France resserrée dans ses limites sans qu'elle
puisse user de ses moyens pour regagner l'influence qu'elle avait à
certaines époques de son histoire.

Le système que le roi a adopté rendra à la nation la confiance que les
mesures de son dernier gouvernement lui ont fait perdre, et avec elle,
l'intervention de la France sera plutôt recherchée que redoutée.

M. le comte de Noailles, qui après son arrivée a été présenté aux
souverains, a recueilli les observations et les paroles qui lui ont
été dites et qui lui ont paru mériter de l'intérêt. Nous avons
l'honneur de vous adresser les notes qui les renferment. Elles ne
présentent que des choses satisfaisantes.

Agréez...

Nº 11--LE PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND AU ROI LOUIS XVIII.

Vienne, le 12 novembre 1814.

SIRE,

M. de Metternich et lord Castlereagh avaient persuadé au cabinet
prussien de faire cause commune avec eux sur la question de la
Pologne. Mais l'espoir qu'ils avaient fondé sur le concours de la
Prusse n'a pas été de longue durée. L'empereur de Russie, ayant engagé
le roi de Prusse à venir dîner chez lui il y a quelques jours, eut
avec lui une conversation dont j'ai pu savoir quelques détails par le
prince Adam Czartoryski. Il lui rappela l'amitié qui les unissait, le
prix qu'il y attachait, tout ce qu'il avait fait pour la rendre
éternelle. Leur âge étant à peu près le même, il lui était doux de
penser qu'ils seraient longtemps témoins du bonheur que leurs peuples
devraient à leur liaison intime. Il avait toujours attaché sa gloire
au rétablissement d'un royaume de Pologne. Quand il touchait à
l'accomplissement de ses désirs, aurait-il la douleur d'avoir à
compter parmi ceux qui s'y opposaient son ami le plus cher et le seul
prince sur les sentiments duquel il eût compté? Le roi fit mille
protestations et lui jura de le soutenir dans la question polonaise.
«Ce n'est pas assez, reprit l'empereur, que vous soyez dans cette
disposition, il faut encore que vos ministres s'y conforment.» Et il
engagea le roi à faire appeler M. de Hardenberg. Celui-ci étant
arrivé, l'empereur répéta devant lui et ce qu'il avait dit, et la
parole que le roi lui avait donnée. M. de Hardenberg voulut faire des
objections, mais pressé par l'empereur Alexandre qui lui demandait
s'il ne voulait pas obéir aux ordres du roi et ces ordres étant
absolus, il ne lui resta qu'à promettre de les exécuter
ponctuellement. Voilà tout ce que j'ai pu savoir de cette scène; mais
elle doit avoir offert beaucoup de particularités que j'ignore, s'il
est vrai, comme M. de Gentz me l'a assuré, que le prince de Hardenberg
ait dit qu'il n'en avait jamais vu de semblable.

Ce changement de la Prusse a fort déconcerté M. de Metternich et lord
Castlereagh. Ils auraient voulu que M. de Hardenberg eût offert sa
démission, et il est certain que cela aurait pu embarrasser[358]
l'empereur et le roi, mais il ne paraît pas y avoir même pensé.

  [358] Variante: que _cela aurait embarrassé_.

Pour moi, qui soupçonnais M. de Metternich d'avoir obtenu le concours
des Prussiens par plus de concessions qu'il n'en avouait, je penchais
plutôt à croire que cette défection de la Prusse était un bien, et
Votre Majesté verra que mes pressentiments n'étaient que trop fondés.

Le grand-duc Constantin, qui est parti depuis deux jours, doit
organiser l'armée du duché de Varsovie. Il est aussi chargé de donner
une organisation civile au pays. Le ton de ses instructions annonce,
selon M. d'Anstedt[359] qui les a rédigées, que l'empereur Alexandre
ne se départira d'aucune de ses prétentions. L'empereur doit avoir
engagé le roi de Prusse à donner pareillement une organisation civile
et militaire à la Saxe. On rapporte qu'il lui a dit: «De
l'organisation civile à la propriété, il n'y a pas loin.» Dans une
lettre que je reçois de M. de Caraman[360], je trouve que le frère du
ministre des finances et plusieurs généraux sont partis de Berlin pour
aller organiser la Saxe[361]. M. de Caraman ajoute que néanmoins
l'occupation de la Saxe n'est plus[362] présentée à Berlin comme
définitive, mais seulement comme provisoire.

  [359] Variante: M. _d'Anstetten_.

  [360] Victor Ricquet, marquis puis duc de Caraman, né en 1762. En
  1814 Louis XVIII le nomma ambassadeur à Berlin, puis, l'année
  suivante, à Vienne. Il assista comme plénipotentiaire aux
  différents congrès de la sainte alliance, et fut créé duc en 1828.
  Il mourut en 1839.

  [361] Variante: _civilement et militairement_.

  [362] Variante: _n'est pas présentée_.

On raconte encore que l'empereur Alexandre, parlant de l'opposition de
l'Autriche à ses vues, et après des plaintes amères contre M. de
Metternich avait dit: «L'Autriche se croit assurée de l'Italie, mais
il y a là un Napoléon dont on peut se servir;» propos dont je ne suis
pas certain, mais qui circule, et qui, s'il est vrai, peut donner la
mesure complète de celui qui l'a tenu.

Lord Castlereagh n'a point encore reçu de réponse à sa dernière note.
Quelques personnes croient que l'empereur ne daignera pas même y
répondre.

Pendant que les affaires de la Pologne et de la Saxe restent ainsi en
suspens, les idées que, dans la conférence dont j'ai eu l'honneur de
rendre compte à Votre Majesté, j'avais mises en avant sur
l'organisation de l'Italie, ont fructifié. Je fus avant-hier chez lord
Castlereagh, et je l'en trouvai rempli. M. de Metternich, qui dînait
hier avec nous chez M. de Rasumowski, ne l'était pas moins. Il nous a
réunis aujourd'hui, lord Castlereagh, M. de Nesselrode et moi, pour
nous en occuper. En arrivant, il m'a prévenu qu'il ne serait question
que de cela; qu'après-demain, demain, dans une heure peut-être, il
serait en état de me parler de la Pologne et de la Saxe, mais que,
pour le moment, il ne le pouvait pas. Je n'ai point insisté. La
conférence a roulé uniquement sur le pays de Gênes. Il a été proposé
de ne point l'incorporer au Piémont, mais de le donner au roi de
Sardaigne par une capitulation qui lui assurât[363] des privilèges et
des institutions particulières. Lord Castlereagh avait apporté des
mémoires et des projets qui lui avaient été adressés à ce sujet. Il
les a lus. Il a fort insisté sur l'établissement d'un port franc, d'un
entrepôt et d'un transit avec des droits très modérés, à travers le
Piémont[364]. On est convenu de se réunir demain et d'appeler à la
conférence MM. de Saint-Marsan et de Brignole.

  [363] Variante: _assurera_.

  [364] Variante: _au travers du_.

Après la conférence, resté seul avec M. de Metternich, et désirant de
savoir où il en était pour la Pologne et pour la Saxe et ce qu'il se
proposait de faire par rapport à l'une et à l'autre, au lieu de lui
faire à cet égard des questions qu'il aurait éludées, je ne lui ai
parlé que de lui-même, et prenant le ton d'une ancienne amitié, je lui
ai dit que, tout en s'occupant des affaires, il fallait aussi songer à
soi-même; qu'il me paraissait qu'il ne le faisait point assez; qu'il y
avait des choses auxquelles on était forcé par la nécessité, mais
qu'il fallait que cette nécessité fût rendue sensible à tout le monde;
qu'on avait beau agir par les motifs les plus purs; que, si ces motifs
étaient inconnus[365] du public, on n'en était pas moins calomnié,
parce que le public alors ne pouvait juger que par les résultats;
qu'il était en butte à toute sorte de reproches; qu'on l'accusait, par
exemple, d'avoir sacrifié la Saxe; que j'espérais bien qu'il ne
l'avait pas fait; mais pourquoi laisser un prétexte à de tels bruits?
Pourquoi ne pas donner à ses amis les moyens de le défendre ou de le
justifier? Un peu d'ouverture de sa part a été la suite de l'espèce
d'abandon avec lequel je lui parlais. Il m'a lu sa note aux Prussiens
sur la question de la Saxe, et quelques remerciements affectueux[366]
de ma part l'ont conduit à me la confier. Je lui ai promis qu'elle
resterait secrète. J'en joins une copie à la lettre que j'ai l'honneur
d'écrire à Votre Majesté. Je la supplie de vouloir bien la garder et
de me permettre de la lui demander à mon retour.

  [365] Variante: _étaient connus_.

  [366] Variante: _assez_ affectueux.

Votre Majesté verra dans cette pièce que M. de Metternich avait promis
aux Prussiens non pas, comme il me l'avait assuré, une portion de la
Saxe, mais la Saxe tout entière, promesse qu'il avait heureusement
subordonnée à une condition dont l'inaccomplissement la rend
nulle[367]. Votre Majesté verra encore par cette note que M. de
Metternich abandonne Luxembourg aux Prussiens, après m'avoir assuré à
diverses reprises qu'il ne leur serait pas donné. Cette même note
révèle encore le projet dès longtemps formé, de placer l'Allemagne
sous ce qu'on appelle l'influence, et ce qui serait réellement la
domination absolue et exclusive de l'Autriche et de la Prusse.

  [367] M. de Metternich livrait la Saxe à la Prusse à deux
  conditions: 1º que la Prusse se séparât de la Russie sur la
  question polonaise; 2º que du côté du Rhin, le Mein d'une part, la
  Moselle de l'autre, servissent de limite entre les États du nord et
  les États du sud, ce qui forçait la Prusse à renoncer à Mayence.
  Or, on sait que Frédéric-Guillaume et l'empereur Alexandre étaient
  étroitement unis dans leurs vues sur la Pologne, et que d'un autre
  côté la Prusse convoitait ardemment Mayence.

Maintenant, M. de Metternich proteste qu'il n'abandonnera point la
Saxe. Quant à la Pologne, il m'a fait entendre qu'il céderait
beaucoup, ce qui signifie qu'il cédera tout, si l'empereur Alexandre
ne se désiste de rien.

J'étais encore avec lui quand on lui a apporté l'état de l'armée
autrichienne. Il me l'a fait voir. La force actuelle de cette armée
consiste en trois cent soixante-quatorze mille hommes, dont
cinquante-deux mille de cavalerie et huit cents pièces de canon. C'est
avec ces forces qu'il croit que la monarchie autrichienne n'a point de
meilleur parti à prendre que de tout souffrir et de se résigner à
tout. Votre Majesté voudra bien remarquer que le nombre des troupes
est l'effectif de l'armée.

Je ne fermerai la lettre que j'ai l'honneur d'écrire à Votre Majesté
qu'au retour d'une conférence à laquelle je vais me rendre ce matin.

Je sors de la conférence. Je m'y suis trouvé avec MM. de Nesselrode,
de Metternich et lord Castlereagh. On a fait entrer M. de
Saint-Marsan, à qui l'on avait donné rendez-vous. Il n'a été question
que de la réunion du pays de Gênes au Piémont. Une espèce de pouvoirs
donnés[368] par le gouvernement provisoire fabriqué, il y a quelques
mois, par lord William Bentinck, a fait naître quelques difficultés.
Elles seront levées en établissant que Gênes est un pays vacant. Il a
été convenu que les huit puissances se réuniraient demain pour en
faire la déclaration et pour donner à M. de Brignole, député de Gênes,
copie du protocole dans lequel cette déclaration sera contenue. Il ne
restera plus à déterminer que le mode de réunion. J'ai profité de la
conférence d'aujourd'hui pour parler de la succession de Sardaigne. M.
de Saint-Marsan, que j'avais prévenu, avait reçu de sa cour des
instructions conformes aux droits de la maison de Carignan. J'ai
proposé un mode de rédaction qui les reconnaît. M. de Saint-Marsan l'a
adopté et soutenu, et j'ai tout lieu de croire qu'il sera admis.

Les conférences pour les affaires de Suisse ne tarderont point à
commencer.

Je suis...

Nº 7 _ter_.--LE ROI LOUIS XVIII AU PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND.

Paris, le 15 novembre 1814.

Mon cousin,

J'ai reçu votre numéro 10 et j'attends avec impatience les importants
détails ultérieurs que vous m'annoncez.

Je saisis avidement l'espoir que vous me donnez pour la Saxe, et je
crois pouvoir m'y livrer avec quelque confiance, du moment que le
prince de Metternich parle, non d'après lui-même, mais d'après l'avis
d'un conseil. J'aimerais sûrement bien mieux que ce royaume restât
entier, mais je crois que son malheureux roi devra encore s'estimer
heureux si on lui en sauve les deux tiers ou les trois quarts.

Quant à l'échange proposé, je n'aime pas, en général, à céder du mien;
je répugne encore plus à dépouiller autrui, et, après tout, les droits
du prince évêque de Bâle, moins importants sans doute au repos de
l'Europe, ne sont pas moins sacrés que ceux du roi de Saxe. Si
cependant la spoliation du premier de ces princes est inévitable, mû
par la double considération de conserver au roi de Sardaigne une
portion de ses États et de rendre un grand service au canton de Berne,
je consentirai à l'échange et je vous envoie une autorisation _ad
hoc_[369].

  [369] Variante: ....._dont vous ferez usage aux cinq conditions
  suivantes dont la première n'est qu'une règle de conduite pour
  nous: 1º impossibilité de sauver la principauté de Bâle; 2º
  garantie au roi de Sardaigne de ce qui lui reste de la Savoie; 3º
  restitution au canton de Berne de sa partie de l'Argovie; 4º libre
  exercice de la religion catholique dans la portion du pays de Gex
  cédée au canton de Genève; 5º libre navigation pour la France sur
  le lac de Genève. A ce prix, vous pouvez signer l'échange._

Sur quoi je prie Dieu qu'il vous ait, mon cousin, en sa sainte et
digne garde.

Nº 13 _bis_.--LES AMBASSADEURS DU ROI AU CONGRÈS, AU MINISTRE DES
AFFAIRES ÉTRANGÈRES A PARIS.

Vienne, le 17 novembre 1814.

Monsieur le comte,

Depuis l'expédition de notre dernière dépêche, une conférence a eu
lieu. Elle a fixé le sort de Gênes conformément à l'article secret qui
réunit ce pays au Piémont.

Une commission a été nommée pour régler les conditions sous lesquelles
cette réunion s'effectuera. On a désigné l'Autriche, la France et
l'Angleterre pour la former. Elle sera composée de M. de Wessemberg,
M. le comte de Noailles et lord Clancarty.

Lord Castlereagh éprouve quelque embarras par la conduite que lord W.
Bentinck a tenue à Gênes. Ce dernier avait flatté le peuple génois
d'une entière indépendance. Lord Castlereagh a soutenu faiblement que
cet amiral avait outrepassé ses pouvoirs, et il a dit qu'il fallait
par tous les moyens de conciliation adoucir aux Génois le sacrifice
qu'on leur imposait. Il a assuré le député de Gênes qu'il procurerait
à son pays tous les avantages dont jouit l'Irlande sa patrie, et nous
sommes curieux de voir comment il compensera l'État de Gênes du droit
de nommer des députés à la Chambre des communes et à celle des pairs,
prérogative dont jouit l'Irlande par son union à la Grande-Bretagne,
et qui ne peut être donnée aux Génois puisque le Piémont n'a pas de
parlement. Ce fait et beaucoup d'autres nous prouvent tous les jours
que ce noble lord a moins étudié les rapports du continent, qu'il
n'est frappé du danger auquel un nouveau système de blocus continental
exposerait sa patrie.

Dans cette conférence, le plénipotentiaire d'Espagne, M. de Labrador,
avait soutenu qu'il fallait laisser aux Génois le droit de se
constituer eux-mêmes, et que l'article secret ne donnait aucun droit
au roi de Sardaigne qui n'a pas signé le traité de Paris. Ce ministre
voulait sans doute essayer, si le voeu que les Génois avaient énoncé
d'être donnés à la reine d'Étrurie pouvait se réaliser.

Le désir de ne pas altérer les dispositions du traité de Paris a porté
la majorité à décider que la _réunion_ de Gênes au Piémont devait
s'effectuer; et que l'acte de soumission de la part de cette
république à la France et la cession qui en était faite par le traité
de Paris mettaient les principes du droit des gens à couvert. Nous
nous sommes rangés à cet avis.

Dès que la copie du procès-verbal de cette conférence nous aura été
remise, nous aurons l'honneur, monsieur le comte, de vous la
transmettre.

Nous vous adressons en attendant une pièce bien plus curieuse, et qui
accuserait sévèrement les principes de la coalition si nous n'étions
témoins de l'embarras qu'elle produit, et, du désir qu'ont les
ministres des quatre puissances à la déclarer, ou apocryphe, ou
publiée par l'effet d'une coupable précipitation de la part du prince
Repnin[370], gouverneur de la Saxe.

  [370] Il s'agit d'une proclamation du prince Repnin, gouverneur de
  la Saxe pour le compte des alliés, qui annonçait que ce pays allait
  être cédé à la Prusse.

Nicolas, prince Repnin-Wolkonski, général et diplomate russe,
petit-fils du célèbre feld-maréchal de ce nom. Né en 1778, il était
colonel à Austerlitz où il fut fait prisonnier. En 1809, il fut nommé
ambassadeur à Cassel près le roi Jérôme-Napoléon. Il devint lieutenant
général en 1813, et après la bataille de Leipsick, fut nommé
gouverneur général de la Saxe, le roi Frédéric-Auguste ayant été
considéré comme prisonnier de guerre. En 1814, il fut accrédité à
Vienne comme plénipotentiaire au congrès; après la paix il fut nommé
gouverneur de la petite Russie (1816), entra plus tard au conseil de
l'empire (1835) et mourut en 1845.

Cette pièce mérite une attention particulière. Elle prouve que, malgré
toutes les peines qu'on s'est données pour nous cacher, dès notre
arrivée, les secrètes machinations de la Russie et de la Prusse, la
faiblesse du prince de Metternich et la médiocrité de conduite de lord
Castlereagh, nous avons pénétré tout d'abord les fausses combinaisons
et la marche irrégulière que les ministres de ces quatre puissances
ont suivies, et qui, sans l'intervention de la France, faisaient
perdre la possibilité même de convenir d'un système d'équilibre
politique, système qui, mal calculé peut-être, se placera cependant
sous l'égide des principes généraux qui gouvernaient l'Europe avant la
Révolution.

La publication de cette circulaire du prince Repnin dans les feuilles
allemandes a causé beaucoup de tracasseries à M. de Stein qui, par son
système de création en Allemagne, s'est fait l'avocat de la réunion de
la Saxe à la Prusse.

Les ministres anglais et autrichiens lui reprochent d'avoir parlé de
leur consentement, qu'ils prétendent n'avoir pas donné et
qu'effectivement ils avaient soumis à de très faibles conditions. On
verra donc paraître des réfutations dans plusieurs gazettes. Mais il
est bon que cette pièce scandaleuse, et qui met à découvert l'intrigue
ourdie ici, soit connue.

Le ministre de Saxe n'a point encore jugé à propos de publier la
protestation du roi, et on se bornera seulement à l'annoncer.

Nous avons l'honneur de vous adresser copie de la circulaire et vous
voudrez bien, monsieur le comte, la faire insérer dans le _Moniteur_
telle qu'elle est adressée ci-jointe au ministère. L'occupation de la
Saxe par les Prussiens est sans doute une faute très grave de la part
du ministère autrichien, et un oubli de tout principe de la part de
lord Castlereagh; mais elle ne décide point encore la question, et
nous voyons avec satisfaction que l'opinion combat avec force cette
mesure.

La Bavière a déclaré qu'elle ne consentirait jamais à la destruction
de la maison et du peuple saxons, et qu'une ligue germanique ne
pouvait être formée avec de tels éléments. Elle a renouvelé ses offres
à l'Autriche, si cette puissance voulait déployer toutes ses forces et
adopter un système plus franc et plus positif.

Le Wurtemberg paraît se rapprocher de cette même direction.

L'opinion en Autriche désapprouve sans réserve l'exécution définitive
de cette mesure, et M. de Metternich est hautement accusé de négliger
les intérêts les plus importants de la monarchie.

Le prince de Talleyrand a eu une troisième conversation avec
l'empereur de Russie, dont il rend compte au roi dans sa dépêche
particulière. Il ne lui a laissé aucun doute sur le parti que le roi
est prêt à prendre dans cette circonstance. L'empereur lui-même était
plus doux et moins décidé qu'il ne l'avait paru dans les premières
entrevues.

La Prusse, de son côté, ne peut se cacher que cette réunion opérée
avec de telles difficultés deviendra une source d'embarras et de
dangers pour elle. Les ministres prussiens cherchent donc à négocier;
ils ont l'air de vouloir réserver au roi de Saxe un équivalent, ou une
portion de la Saxe renfermant la moitié de la population; mais rien
n'est consenti à cet égard de leur part. Ils ont même annoncé qu'il
suffisait de conserver un duc de Saxe.

Le prince de Talleyrand a prouvé à l'empereur de Russie qu'il fallait
conserver seize cent mille habitants à la Saxe, parce que la Saxe
renferme un peu plus de deux millions d'âmes; qu'elle doit garder tout
ce qu'elle a sur la rive gauche de l'Elbe, et que les territoires, sur
la rive droite, ont une population inférieure qui ne s'élève pas à
plus de cinq à six cent mille âmes. On pourrait peut-être admettre un
peu moins de seize cent mille habitants; et comme l'Angleterre et
l'Autriche n'ont point encore abandonné la demande de limites
régulières en Pologne, tout est intact, et on ne peut annoncer le
dernier résultat d'une négociation qui, sans la fermeté de l'ambassade
du roi, eût été abandonnée entièrement.

En tout état de choses, il sera moins important pour la France de voir
sacrifier une partie de la Pologne à la Russie, que de voir détruire
la Saxe; et quelques ministres autrichiens pensent que, s'il fallait
céder sur l'un ou l'autre point, l'Autriche devait être également plus
facile sur les limites en Pologne, à condition que la Prusse
n'obtiendra pas l'avantage de réunir la Saxe à sa monarchie.

C'est par l'action réunie de ces différents rapports et par une marche
plus conforme aux vrais principes de la part de l'Angleterre, que nous
espérons que cette cause pourra être sauvée.

Les nouvelles d'Italie parlent des intrigues du roi de Naples et de
ses armements. Nous observons ici la crainte qu'en éprouve M. le
prince de Metternich. On nous assure cependant que la cour de Russie a
rappelé l'officier qu'elle tenait près de Murat, et que les lettres de
créance expédiées au ministre de Russie, à Palerme, portent qu'il est
accrédité près _du roi des Deux-Siciles_.

Il circule ici une brochure rédigée par un nommé Filangieri[371], aide
de camp de Murat, et qui porte un caractère révolutionnaire et
menaçant. La police l'a fait racheter. M. le prince de Metternich se
sert de ces alarmes pour égarer l'opinion à l'égard de la conservation
de Murat sur le trône de Naples. Mais il est le seul des ministres de
l'empereur d'Autriche même, qui soutienne cette cause dont l'Europe
fera justice.

  [371] Charles Filangieri, prince de Satriano, duc de Taormina, né
  en 1785, général napolitain, l'un des officiers les plus dévoués à
  Murat. Il fut grièvement blessé en 1815 au moment de la reprise des
  hostilités avec les Autrichiens. Il conserva son grade après la
  restauration des Bourbons. En 1848, le roi Ferdinand le chargea de
  soumettre la Sicile. Il y réussit après de sanglants combats, fut
  nommé lieutenant général et gouverneur de cette province, mais se
  démit peu après, et vécut dès lors dans la retraite.

L'empereur de Russie a signé les ratifications du traité fait entre
lui et le roi de Danemark, et elles ont été échangées hier. Les
troupes russes doivent évacuer le Holstein.

Rien n'a encore été arrêté sur les affaires de la Suisse, et celles de
la fédération allemande ne sont pas très avancées. M. de Metternich
et M. de Hardenberg ont communiqué le plan général à M. le comte de
Nesselrode pour le soumettre à l'empereur. Dans une réponse en date du
11 novembre, M. de Nesselrode annonce aux cabinets d'Autriche et de
Prusse que la Russie applaudit aux bases qui doivent former le pacte
fédératif.

Nous avons l'honneur de vous adresser ce projet tel qu'il nous a été
communiqué confidentiellement, et tel qu'il sert aux délibérations du
comité allemand. Beaucoup de changements y ont eu lieu, nommément la
division en cercles, le droit de guerre et de paix... Nous espérons
avoir communication de la note de M. de Nesselrode, que nous
transmettrons également au ministère.

Nº 12.--LE PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND AU ROI LOUIS XVIII.

Vienne, le 17 novembre 1814.

SIRE,

Avant que l'empereur Alexandre eût ramené la Prusse à lui, des[372]
personnes de sa confiance lui ayant conseillé de se tourner du côté de
la France, de s'entendre avec elle et de me voir, il avait répondu
qu'il me verrait volontiers, et que désormais, pour lui faire demander
une audience, il fallait que je m'adressasse, non au comte de
Nesselrode, mais au prince Wolkonski, son premier aide de camp. Je dis
à la personne par qui l'avis m'en fut donné, que, si je faisais
demander une audience à l'empereur, les Autrichiens et les Anglais ne
pourraient pas l'ignorer, qu'ils en prendraient de l'ombrage et
bâtiraient là-dessus toute sorte de conjectures, et qu'en la faisant
demander par la voie inusitée d'un aide de camp, je donnerais à mes
relations avec l'empereur un air d'intrigue qui ne pouvait convenir ni
à l'un ni à l'autre. A quelques jours de là, comme il demandait
pourquoi il ne m'avait pas vu, on lui fit connaître mes motifs et il
les approuva, en ajoutant: «Ce sera donc moi qui l'attaquerai le
premier.» Ayant souvent l'occasion de me trouver avec lui dans de
grandes réunions, je m'étais fait la règle d'être le moins possible
sur son passage ou[373] près de lui, et de l'éviter autant que cela
pouvait se faire sans manquer aux bienséances. J'en usai de la sorte
samedi, chez le comte Zichy, où il était. J'avais passé presque tout
le temps dans la salle du jeu, et, profitant pour me retirer du moment
où l'on se mettait à table, j'avais déjà gagné la porte de
l'antichambre, lorsque, ayant senti une main qui s'appuyait sur mon
épaule et m'étant retourné, je vis que cette main était celle de
l'empereur Alexandre. Il me demanda pourquoi je ne l'allais pas voir?
quand il me verrait? ce que je ferais le lundi? me dit d'aller chez
lui ce jour-là, le matin à onze heures; d'y aller en frac, de
reprendre avec lui mes habitudes de frac, et, en disant cela, il me
prenait les bras[374] et me les serrait d'une manière tout amicale.

  [372] Variante: _les_.

  [374] Variante: et _disant_ cela, il me prenait _le_ bras et me
  _le_ serrait.

J'eus soin d'informer M. de Metternich et lord Castlereagh de ce qui
s'était passé, afin d'éloigner toute idée de mystère et de prévenir
tout soupçon de leur part.

Je me rendis chez l'empereur à l'heure indiquée. «Je suis, me dit-il,
bien aise de vous voir. Et vous aussi, vous désiriez de me voir,
n'est-ce pas?» Je lui répondis que je témoignais toujours du regret de
me trouver dans le même lieu que lui, et de ne le pas voir plus
souvent, après quoi l'entretien s'engagea.

«Où en sont les affaires, et quelle est maintenant votre
position?--Sire, elle est toujours la même: si Votre Majesté veut
rétablir la Pologne dans un état complet d'indépendance, nous sommes
prêts à la soutenir.--Je désirais à Paris le rétablissement de la
Pologne, et vous l'approuviez; je le désire encore comme homme, comme
toujours fidèle aux idées libérales que je n'abandonnerai jamais. Mais
dans ma situation, les désirs de l'homme ne peuvent pas être la règle
du souverain. Peut-être le jour arrivera-t-il où la Pologne pourra
être rétablie. Quant à présent, il n'y faut pas penser.--S'il ne
s'agit que du partage du duché de Varsovie, c'est l'affaire de
l'Autriche et de la Prusse, beaucoup plus que la nôtre. Ces deux
puissances une fois satisfaites sur ce point, nous serons satisfaits
nous-mêmes; tant qu'elles ne le seront pas, il nous est prescrit de
les soutenir, et notre devoir est de le faire, puisque l'Autriche a
laissé arriver des difficultés qu'il lui était si facile de
prévenir.--Comment cela?--En demandant, lors de son alliance avec
vous, à faire[375] occuper par ses troupes la partie du duché de
Varsovie qui lui avait appartenu. Vous ne le lui auriez certainement
pas refusé, et, si elle eût occupé ce pays, vous n'auriez pas songé à
le lui ôter.--L'Autriche et moi nous sommes d'accord.--Ce n'est pas
là ce qu'on croit dans le public.--Nous sommes d'accord sur les
points principaux: il n'y a plus de discussion que pour quelques
villages.--Dans cette question la France n'est qu'en seconde
ligne; elle est en première dans celle de la Saxe.--En effet,
la question de la Saxe est pour la maison de Bourbon une question de
famille.--Nullement, Sire. Dans l'affaire de la Saxe, il ne s'agit
point de l'intérêt d'un individu, ou d'une famille particulière; il
s'agit de l'intérêt de tous les rois; il s'agit du premier intérêt de
Votre Majesté elle-même: car son premier intérêt est de prendre soin
de cette gloire personnelle qu'elle a acquise et dont l'éclat
rejaillit sur son empire. Votre Majesté doit en prendre soin, non
seulement pour elle-même, mais encore pour son pays, dont cette gloire
est devenue le patrimoine. Elle y mettra le sceau en protégeant, en
faisant respecter les principes qui sont le fondement de l'ordre
public et de la sécurité de tous. Je vous parle, Sire, non comme
ministre de France, mais comme un homme qui vous est sincèrement
attaché.--Vous parlez de principes, mais c'en est un que l'on doit
tenir sa parole, et j'ai donné la mienne.--Il y a des engagements de
divers ordres, et celui qu'en passant le Niémen Votre Majesté prit
envers l'Europe doit l'emporter sur tout autre. Permettez-moi, Sire,
d'ajouter que l'intervention de la Russie, dans les affaires de
l'Europe, est généralement vue d'un oeil de jalousie et d'inquiétude,
et que, si elle a été soufferte, c'est uniquement à cause du caractère
personnel de Votre Majesté. Il est donc nécessaire que ce caractère
se conserve entier.--Ceci est une affaire qui ne concerne que moi, et
dont je suis le seul juge.--Pardonnez-moi, Sire, quand on est
homme[376] de l'histoire, on a pour juge le monde entier.--Le roi de
Saxe est l'homme le moins digne d'intérêt: il a violé ses
engagements.--Il n'en avait pris aucun avec Votre Majesté; il n'en
avait pris qu'avec l'Autriche. Elle seule serait donc en droit de lui
en vouloir, et, tout au contraire, je sais que les projets formés sur
la Saxe font éprouver à l'empereur d'Autriche la peine la plus vive,
ce que Votre Majesté ignore très certainement; sans quoi, vivant, elle
et sa famille, avec lui et chez lui depuis deux mois, elle n'aurait
jamais pu se résoudre à la lui causer. Ces mêmes projets affligent et
alarment le peuple de Vienne, j'en ai chaque jour des preuves.--Mais
l'Autriche abandonne la Saxe.--M. de Metternich, que je vis hier soir,
me montra des dispositions bien opposées à ce que Votre Majesté me
fait l'honneur de me dire.--Et vous-même, on dit que vous consentez à
en abandonner une partie?--Nous ne le ferons qu'avec un extrême
regret. Mais si, pour que la Prusse ait une population égale à celle
qu'elle avait en 1806, et qui n'allait qu'à neuf millions deux cent
mille âmes, il est nécessaire de donner de trois à quatre cent mille
Saxons, c'est un sacrifice que nous ferons pour le bien de la
paix.--Et voilà ce que les Saxons redoutent le plus. Ils ne demandent
pas mieux que d'appartenir au roi de Prusse; tout ce qu'ils désirent,
c'est de n'être pas divisés.--Nous sommes à portée de savoir[377] ce
qui se passe en Saxe, et nous savons que les Saxons sont désespérés
de l'idée[378] de devenir Prussiens.--Non, tout ce qu'ils craignent
c'est d'être partagés, et c'est en effet, ce qu'il y a de plus
malheureux pour un peuple.--Sire, si l'on appliquait ce raisonnement
à la Pologne!--Le partage de la Pologne n'est pas de mon fait.
Il ne tient pas à moi que ce mal ne soit réparé; je vous l'ai dit,
peut-être le sera-t-il un jour.--La cession d'une partie des deux
Lusaces ne serait point proprement un démembrement de la Saxe; elles
ne lui étaient point incorporées; elles avaient été jusqu'à ces
derniers temps un fief relevant de la couronne de Bohême; elles
n'avaient de commun avec la Saxe que d'être possédées par le même
souverain[379].--Dites-moi, est-il vrai qu'on fasse des armements en
France? (En me faisant cette question, l'empereur s'est approché si
près de moi, que son visage touchait presque le mien.)--Oui,
Sire.--Combien le roi a-t-il de troupes?--Cent trente mille hommes
sous les drapeaux et trois cent mille renvoyés chez eux, mais pouvant
être rappelés au premier moment.--Combien en rappelle-t-on
maintenant?--Ce qui est nécessaire pour compléter le pied de paix.
Nous avons tour à tour senti le besoin de n'avoir plus d'armée et le
besoin d'en avoir une; de n'en avoir plus, quand l'armée était celle
de Bonaparte[380], et d'en avoir une qui fût celle du roi. Il a fallu
pour cela dissoudre et recomposer, désarmer d'abord, et ensuite
réarmer, et voilà ce qu'en ce moment, on achève de faire. Tel est le
motif de nos armements actuels. Ils ne menacent personne; mais quand
toute l'Europe est armée, il a paru nécessaire que la France le fût,
dans une proportion convenable.--C'est bien. J'espère que ces
affaires-ci mèneront à un rapprochement entre la France et la Russie.
Quelles sont, à cet égard les dispositions du roi?--Le roi n'oubliera
jamais les services que Votre Majesté lui a rendus, et sera toujours
prêt à les reconnaître, mais il a ses devoirs comme souverain d'un
grand pays, et comme chef de l'une des plus puissantes et des plus
anciennes maisons de l'Europe. Il ne saurait abandonner la maison de
Saxe. Il veut qu'en cas de nécessité, nous protestions. L'Espagne, la
Bavière, d'autres États encore, protesteraient comme nous.--Écoutez,
faisons un marché: soyez aimables pour moi dans la question de la
Saxe, et je le serai pour vous dans celle de Naples. Je n'ai point
d'engagement de ce côté.--Votre Majesté sait bien qu'un tel marché
n'est pas faisable. Il n'y a pas de parité entre les deux questions.
Il est impossible que Votre Majesté ne veuille pas, par rapport à
Naples, ce que nous voulons nous-mêmes.--Eh bien! persuadez donc aux
Prussiens de me rendre ma parole.--Je vois fort peu de Prussiens[381],
et ne viendrais sûrement pas à bout de les persuader. Mais Votre
Majesté a tous les moyens de le faire. Elle a tout pouvoir sur
l'esprit du roi; elle peut d'ailleurs les contenter.--Et de
quelle manière?--En leur laissant quelque chose de plus en
Pologne.--Singulier expédient que vous me proposez: vous voulez que je
prenne sur moi, pour leur donner!»

  [375] En _demandant à faire_, lors de son alliance avec vous,
  _occuper_.

  [376] Variante: _l'homme_.

  [377] Variante: _de connaître_.

  [378] Variante: _à l'idée_.

  [379] La Lusace est une province d'Allemagne située entre l'Elbe et
  l'Oder, au nord de la Bohême et au sud du Brandebourg. Elle était
  divisée en haute et basse Lusace, formant chacune un margraviat.
  Les Lusaces faisaient primitivement partie du royaume de Bohême.
  Elles en furent détachées en 1231 par le roi Ottokar, qui les donna
  en dot à sa fille lors de son mariage avec le margrave de
  Brandebourg. Toutefois elles revinrent à la Bohême au siècle
  suivant. En 1635, l'empereur Ferdinand II détacha de nouveau cette
  province de la Bohême et la donna définitivement au duc de Saxe,
  Jean-George.

  [380] Variante: _Buonaparte_.

  [381] Variante: _les_ Prussiens.

L'entretien fut interrompu par l'impératrice de Russie, qui entra chez
l'empereur. Elle voulut bien me dire des choses obligeantes. Elle ne
resta que quelques moments, et l'empereur reprit: «Résumons-nous.»--Je
récapitulai brièvement les points sur lesquels je pouvais, et ceux sur
lesquels je ne pouvais point composer, et je finis par dire que je
devais insister sur la conservation du royaume de Saxe avec seize cent
mille habitants. «Oui, me dit l'empereur, vous insistez beaucoup sur
une chose _décidée_.» Mais il ne prononça point ce mot de ce ton qui
annonce une détermination qui ne peut changer.

Son but, en m'appelant chez lui, était de savoir:

1º Ce que c'était que les armements qu'il avait ouï dire que l'on
faisait en France, et dans quelles vues ils étaient faits. Je crois
lui avoir répondu de manière à ce qu'il ne pût pas se croire menacé,
et, cependant[382], à ne pas lui laisser une trop grande sécurité;

2º Si Votre Majesté serait disposée à faire un jour une alliance avec
lui. A moins qu'il ne renonçât à l'esprit de conquête, ce qui n'est
nullement présumable, je ne vois pas comment il serait possible que
Votre Majesté, tout animée de l'esprit de conservation, s'alliât avec
lui, si ce n'est dans un cas extraordinaire et pour un but momentané.
Mais il ne convenait pas, s'il en avait le désir, de lui en ôter
l'espérance, et j'ai dû éviter de le faire;

3º Quelles étaient au juste nos déterminations par rapport à la Saxe.
A cet égard, je lui ai laissé si peu de doutes, qu'il a dit au comte
de Nesselrode, par qui je l'ai su: «Les Français sont décidés, sur la
question de la Saxe. Mais qu'ils s'arrangent avec la Prusse. Ils
voudraient prendre sur moi pour lui donner, mais c'est à quoi je ne
consens pas.»

  [382] Variante: _de façon à_.

Je n'ai rapporté cet entretien avec tant de détail que pour que Votre
Majesté pût mieux juger combien, depuis la dernière audience que
j'avais eue de l'empereur, son ton était changé. Il n'a point donné,
dans tout le cours de notre conversation, une seule marque
d'irritation ou d'humeur. Tout a été calme et doux.

Il est sûrement moins touché des intérêts de la Prusse et moins retenu
par l'amitié qu'il porte au roi, qu'il n'est embarrassé des promesses
qu'il lui a faites, et je croirais volontiers que, malgré le caractère
chevaleresque qu'il affecte et tout esclave qu'il veut paraître de sa
parole, il serait, dans le fond de l'âme, enchanté d'avoir un prétexte
honnête pour se dégager.

J'en juge surtout par une conversation qu'il a eue avec le prince de
Schwarzenberg, et qui, je crois, n'a pas peu contribué à lui faire
désirer de me voir. Il lui demandait où en étaient leurs affaires[383]
et s'ils parviendraient à s'entendre, et le pressait de lui donner son
opinion, non comme ministre d'Autriche, mais comme un ami. Après
s'être quelque temps défendu de répondre[384], le prince de
Schwarzenberg lui dit nettement que sa conduite envers l'Autriche
avait été peu franche et même peu loyale, que ses prétentions
tendaient à mettre la monarchie autrichienne dans un véritable danger,
et les choses dans une situation qui rendrait la guerre inévitable;
que si on ne la faisait pas maintenant (soit par respect pour
l'alliance récente[385], soit pour ne pas se montrer à l'Europe comme
des étourdis qui n'avaient rien su prévoir, et s'étaient mis, par une
aveugle confiance, à la merci des événements), elle arriverait
infailliblement d'ici à dix-huit mois ou deux ans. Alors, il échappa à
l'empereur de dire: «Si je m'étais moins avancé! Mais, ajouta-t-il,
comment puis-je me dégager? Vous sentez bien qu'au point où j'en suis,
il est impossible que je recule.»

  [383] Variante: _les_ affaires.

  [384] Variante: de _rompre_.

  [385] Variante: _naissante_.

En même temps que M. de Schwarzenberg présentait la guerre comme
inévitable, tôt ou tard, un corps de troupes que l'Autriche a fait
marcher en Gallicie semblait indiquer qu'elle pourrait être prochaine.
Le cabinet de Vienne a paru vouloir sortir de son engourdissement. M.
de Metternich a parlé d'alliance au prince de Wrède, en lui demandant
si, dès à présent, la Bavière ne voudrait pas joindre vingt-cinq mille
hommes aux forces autrichiennes, à quoi le prince de Wrède a répondu
que la Bavière serait prête à fournir jusqu'à soixante-quinze mille
hommes, mais sous les conditions suivantes:

1º Que l'alliance serait conclue avec la France;

2º Que la Bavière fournirait vingt-cinq mille hommes, et non
davantage, par chaque cent mille hommes que l'Autriche ferait marcher;

3º Que si l'Angleterre donnait des subsides à l'Autriche, la Bavière
en recevrait sa part, dans la proportion de leurs forces respectives.

Je crois bien qu'au fond ce ne sont encore là que de simples
démonstrations; mais c'est déjà beaucoup que l'Angleterre[386] se soit
déterminée à les faire, et elles ont dû naturellement donner à
l'empereur Alexandre l'envie de savoir ce qu'il avait à craindre ou à
se promettre de nous.

  [386] Variante: que _l'Autriche_.

Sachant que son habitude, lorsqu'il parle à quelqu'un de ceux qui sont
opposés à ses vues, est d'affirmer qu'il est d'accord avec les autres,
et ne voulant pas que les résultats de mon entretien avec lui pussent
être présentés sous un faux jour, j'ai profité d'une visite que m'a
faite M. de Sickingen pour les faire connaître par lui à l'empereur
d'Autriche. L'empereur en a instruit M. de Metternich, par le récit
duquel j'ai vu que M. de Sickingen avait été un intermédiaire fidèle.
Cette confidence a produit le meilleur effet. Le sentiment universel
de défiance auquel nous avons été en butte, dans les premiers temps de
notre séjour ici, s'affaiblit chaque jour, et le sentiment contraire
s'accroît.

A mon retour de chez l'empereur Alexandre, je trouvai chez moi le
ministre de Saxe, qui venait me communiquer:

1º Une protestation du roi de Saxe, que ce prince lui avait envoyée
avec ordre de la remettre au congrès; mais après avoir consulté[387]
M. de Metternich, aux avis duquel il lui est prescrit de se conformer;

2º Une circulaire du prince Repnin, qui était en Saxe gouverneur
général pour les Russes. Cette pièce, dont je joins une copie à ma
dépêche au département pour qu'elle soit imprimée dans le _Moniteur_,
est ce qui a motivé la protestation du roi, qui ne pourra être
imprimée qu'après avoir été officiellement remise au congrès. J'en
aurai seulement alors une copie[388].

  [387] Variante: après _avoir communiqué à_.

  [388] Voici cette circulaire:

  «Une lettre de M. le ministre, baron de Stein, en date du 21
  octobre, m'a informé d'une convention conclue le 28 septembre à
  Vienne, et en vertu de laquelle Sa Majesté l'empereur de Russie, de
  concert avec l'Autriche et l'Angleterre, mettra dans les mains de
  Sa Majesté le roi de Prusse l'administration du royaume de Saxe.
  J'ai l'ordre de remettre le gouvernement de ce pays aux fondés de
  pouvoir de Sa Majesté le roi de Prusse, qui se présenteront, et de
  faire relever les troupes impériales russes par des troupes
  prussiennes, afin d'opérer par là la réunion de la Saxe à la
  Prusse, laquelle aura lieu prochainement d'une manière plus
  formelle et plus solennelle, et pour établir la fraternité entre
  les deux peuples... Après des délibérations préliminaires qui ont
  pour but le bien-être de l'ensemble et des parties qui le
  composent, Leurs Majestés ont, savoir: le roi Frédéric-Guillaume,
  en qualité de futur souverain du pays, déclaré qu'il a l'intention
  de ne point incorporer comme une province la Saxe à ses États, mais
  de la réunir à la Prusse sous le titre de royaume de Saxe; de la
  conserver pour toujours dans son intégrité; de lui laisser la
  jouissance de ses droits, privilèges et avantages que la
  constitution de l'Allemagne assurera à ceux des pays de l'Allemagne
  qui font partie de la monarchie prussienne, et jusque-là de ne rien
  changer à sa constitution actuelle. Et Sa Majesté l'empereur
  Alexandre a fait témoigner la satisfaction particulière que lui
  cause cette déclaration.» (_Moniteur_ du 15 novembre 1814.--Voir
  également, sur la cérémonie de la remise des pouvoirs du prince
  Repnin aux autorités prussiennes, le _Moniteur_ du 24 novembre.)

Cette circulaire par laquelle le prince Repnin annonce aux autorités
saxonnes, qu'en conséquence d'une convention conclue dès le 27
septembre, l'empereur Alexandre, de l'aveu de l'_Autriche_ et de
l'_Angleterre_, a ordonné de remettre l'administration de la Saxe aux
délégués du roi de Prusse qui doit à l'avenir posséder ce pays, non
comme une province de son royaume, mais comme un royaume séparé dont
il a promis de maintenir l'intégrité, a jeté dans le dernier embarras
M. de Metternich et lord Castlereagh, et excité de leur part les
plaintes les plus vives.

Il est bien vrai que l'on a abusé de la manière la plus odieuse de
leur consentement, en le dénaturant, en le présentant comme absolu,
quand il était purement conditionnel, ce qui justifie leurs plaintes.
Mais il n'est pas moins vrai qu'ils ont donné un consentement qu'ils
regrettent amèrement d'avoir donné.

Votre Majesté a déjà la note de M. de Metternich.

J'ai aujourd'hui l'honneur de lui envoyer celle de lord Castlereagh.
Je l'ai seulement depuis deux jours. On ne me l'a procurée que sur la
promesse de la tenir très secrète. C'est pourquoi je l'adresse
directement à Votre Majesté elle-même. On m'a dit que lord Castlereagh
travaillait à se la faire rendre par les Prussiens.

Cette note confirme tout ce que j'ai eu l'honneur de mander à Votre
Majesté depuis six semaines, et révèle même des choses que je n'aurais
pas crues, si elle n'en offrait incontestablement la preuve.

Quelque étrange que soit la note de M. de Metternich, sitôt qu'on la
compare à celle de lord Castlereagh, on trouve entre elles des
différences toutes à l'avantage de la première.

M. de Metternich essaye de persuader à la Prusse qu'elle doit renoncer
à ses vues sur la Saxe. Il expose les raisons morales et politiques
qui font qu'il répugne à donner son consentement, et, en le donnant,
il avoue que c'est une sorte de nécessité qui le lui arrache.

Lord Castlereagh, au contraire, après quelques expressions d'une vive
et stérile pitié pour la famille royale de Saxe, déclare qu'il n'a
aucune sorte de répugnance morale ou politique à abandonner la Saxe à
la Prusse[389].

  [389] Voici ce que lord Castlereagh, dans cette note adressée au
  prince de Hardenberg, dit de la Saxe:

  «Quant à la question de la Saxe, je vous déclare que si
  l'incorporation de la totalité de ce pays dans la monarchie
  prussienne est nécessaire pour assurer un aussi grand bien à
  l'Europe, quelque peine que j'éprouve personnellement à l'idée de
  voir une si ancienne famille si profondément affligée, je ne
  saurais nourrir aucune répugnance morale ou politique contre la
  mesure elle-même. Si jamais un souverain s'est placé lui-même dans
  le cas de devoir être sacrifié à la tranquillité future de
  l'Europe, je crois que c'est le roi de Saxe, par ses
  tergiversations perpétuelles et parce qu'il a été non seulement le
  plus dévoué, mais aussi le plus favorisé des vassaux de Bonaparte,
  contribuant de tout son pouvoir et avec empressement, en sa double
  qualité de chef d'État allemand et d'État polonais, à étendre
  l'asservissement général jusqu'au coeur de la Russie.» (_Note de
  lord Castlereagh adressée au prince de Hardenberg, 14 octobre
  1814._)

M. de Metternich ne consent qu'autant que la Prusse aura fait des
pertes qu'il sera impossible de lui compenser d'une autre manière.

Lord Castlereagh ne consent, au contraire, qu'autant que la Prusse
conservera ce que M. de Metternich parle de lui compenser. Il veut que
la Saxe soit pour elle un accroissement de puissance, et non point un
équivalent.

Ainsi, ils subordonnent l'un et l'autre la question de la Saxe à celle
de la Pologne, mais dans des sens absolument opposés, ce qui montre à
quel point ces alliés si unis et qui criaient si haut que la France
voulait les diviser, sont peu d'accord entre eux.

Ils se sont cependant entendus pour faire désavouer la circulaire du
prince Repnin, et je crois qu'elle sera désavouée par les Prussiens
eux-mêmes.

Au reste, il me paraît difficile que l'oubli, si ce n'est le mépris
des principes et des notions les plus communes de la saine politique,
puisse être porté plus loin que dans cette note de lord Castlereagh.

Il vint hier me demander à dîner et me proposa un entretien pour
aujourd'hui. Je m'étais attendu à quelque confidence ou à quelque
ouverture importante; il venait seulement me parler de ses embarras.
Trompé dans l'espoir qu'il avait fondé sur la Prusse, et voyant par là
son système renversé par sa base, il est tombé dans une sorte
d'abattement. Il venait me consulter sur le moyen de donner aux
affaires une impulsion qui les fît marcher. Je lui ai dit que
l'empereur Alexandre prétendait être d'accord avec l'Autriche sur la
question de la Pologne, et qu'il ne leur restait plus que quelques
détails à régler; que si cela était, ce que je voyais de mieux à
faire, c'était qu'il engageât l'Autriche à terminer promptement cet
arrangement; qu'ils avaient voulu subordonner[390] l'une à l'autre les
questions de Pologne et de Saxe, et que cela ne leur avait pas réussi;
qu'il fallait donc les séparer et terminer d'abord celle de Pologne;
que l'Autriche, tranquille de ce côté et n'ayant plus à se partager
entre les deux questions, serait tout entière à celle de la Saxe, que
tous les militaires autrichiens regardaient comme étant de beaucoup la
plus importante des deux; que la Russie, satisfaite sur celle qui
l'intéresse directement, gênerait probablement fort peu sur l'autre,
et que la Prusse, se trouvant seule vis-à-vis de l'Autriche, de
l'Angleterre, de la France et de l'Espagne, l'affaire serait
facilement et promptement réglée.

  [390] Variante: qu'ils _avaient subordonné_.

La circulaire du prince Repnin a été le signal que la Bavière
attendait pour déclarer qu'elle ne souscrirait à aucun arrangement, et
n'entrerait dans aucune ligue allemande, que la conservation du
royaume de Saxe n'eût été préalablement assurée. C'est ce que le
prince de Wrède a déclaré positivement au prince de Hardenberg qui,
tout en disant qu'il ne pouvait rien prendre sur lui et qu'il en
référerait au roi, a cependant fait entendre que le roi de Saxe
pourrait être conservé avec un million de sujets.

Ainsi, tout est encore en suspens. Mais les chances de sauver une
grande partie de la Saxe se sont accrues.

J'en étais à cet endroit de ma lettre, quand j'ai reçu celle dont
Votre Majesté m'a honoré en date du 9 novembre, et celle qu'elle a
bien voulu me faire écrire par M. le comte de Blacas.

Votre Majesté jugera par la note de lord Castlereagh, que j'ai
l'honneur de lui envoyer, ou que ce ministre a des instructions que le
duc de Wellington ne connaît pas, ou qu'il ne se croit pas lié par
celles qui lui ont été données, et que, s'il a fait dépendre la
question de la Saxe de celle de la Pologne, c'est dans un sens
précisément inverse de celui que le duc de Wellington supposait.

Quant à ce qui concerne Naples, j'ai rendu compte à Votre Majesté de
la proposition que M. de Metternich, dans une de ces conférences où
nous n'étions que lui, lord Castlereagh, M. de Nesselrode et moi,
avait faite, de ne s'entendre sur cette affaire qu'après le congrès,
et de ma réponse. (C'est dans le numéro 10 de ma correspondance que se
trouve ce détail.) Les menaces contenues dans la lettre dont M. de
Blacas m'a envoyé un extrait se retrouvent, dit-on, dans un pamphlet
publié par un aide de camp de Murat, nommé Filangieri, qui était
encore tout récemment à Vienne. (Ce pamphlet a été enlevé par la
police.) Mais j'espère que si l'Italie est une fois organisée depuis
les Alpes jusqu'aux frontières de Naples, ainsi que je l'ai proposé,
ces menaces ne seront guère à craindre.

J'ai attendu pour fermer ma lettre que je fusse de retour d'une
conférence qui nous avait été indiquée pour ce soir à huit heures. On
n'y a fait que lire et signer le protocole de la dernière conférence.

L'empereur de Russie est indisposé assez pour avoir dû garder le lit,
mais ce n'est qu'une indisposition.

Nº 8 _ter_.--LE ROI LOUIS XVIII AU PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND.

Paris, le 22 novembre 1814.

Mon cousin,

J'ai reçu votre numéro 11. Il me fournirait ample matière à
réflexions, si je ne me les étais pas interdites, lorsqu'elles ne
pourraient servir qu'à ma satisfaction personnelle.

Les discours que le comte Alexis de Noailles a entendus de la bouche
des princes avec lesquels il s'est entretenu m'ont fait plaisir; celui
du roi de Bavière m'a surtout frappé; mais que serviraient[391] ces
dispositions, si elles ne sont soutenues par l'Autriche et
l'Angleterre? Or, je crains bien que malgré la manière infiniment
adroite dont vous avez parlé au prince de Metternich, malgré
l'accomplissement des conditions portées dans la note du 22 octobre,
et Pologne et Saxe ne soient abandonnées. Dans ce malheur il restera
toujours à mon infortuné cousin, sa constance dans l'adversité, et à
moi, (car j'y suis plus résolu que jamais) de n'avoir participé par
aucun consentement à ces iniques spoliations.

  [391] Variante: que _serviront_.

Je crois au propos attribué à l'empereur Alexandre au sujet de
l'Italie; il est dans ce cas, de la plus haute importance que
l'Autriche et l'Angleterre se pénètrent bien de l'adage, trivial si
l'on veut, mais plein de sens, et surtout éminemment applicable à la
circonstance: _Sublata causa, tollitur effectus._

Je suis plus content de la tournure que prennent les affaires
d'Italie; la réunion de Gênes, la succession masculine de la maison de
Savoie[392] sont deux points importants; mais ce qui l'est par-dessus
tout, c'est que malgré les vanteries, peut-être en réalité trop
fondées de Murat dans ses gazettes, le royaume de Naples retourne à
son légitime souverain.

  [392] Variante: _dans_ la maison de Savoie.

Sur quoi, je prie Dieu qu'il vous ait, mon cousin, en sa sainte et
digne garde.

LOUIS.

Nº 14 _bis_.--LES AMBASSADEURS DU ROI AU CONGRÈS, AU MINISTRE DES
AFFAIRES ÉTRANGÈRES A PARIS.

Vienne le 23 novembre 1814.

Monsieur le comte,

Nous avons l'honneur de vous adresser la copie du procès-verbal de la
dernière séance. On s'est réuni depuis pour l'ajuster et le signer,
mais on n'a traité d'aucune affaire. M. de Labrador, à cette
occasion, a rappelé les droits de la reine d'Étrurie, et a demandé
qu'en procédant aux arrangements à prendre en Italie, on voulût s'en
occuper. Le prince de Metternich lui a dit qu'il était préparé à
discuter cette matière, et qu'il attendait que M. de Labrador lui
communiquât son mémoire. M. l'ambassadeur d'Espagne doit le remettre
un de ces jours.

Si les paroles de M. de Metternich pouvaient inspirer la moindre
confiance, on serait fondé à croire qu'il trouverait l'archiduchesse
Marie-Louise suffisamment établie en obtenant l'État de Lucques qui
rapporte cinq à six cent mille francs, et que, pour lors, les
légations pourraient être rendues au pape, et Parme à la reine
d'Étrurie. Mais nous sommes informés que pendant qu'il énonce cette
opinion, l'archiduchesse Marie-Louise fait changer, d'après
l'invitation de l'empereur son père, les armes de ses voitures et de
ses cachets, et fait effacer les armes impériales de Bonaparte pour
leur substituer celles de Parme.

M. de Noailles, qui est chargé de suivre les négociations qui
concernent l'Italie, a reçu l'ordre de M. le prince de Talleyrand, de
n'admettre les arrangements qui seraient arrêtés, que comme des
dispositions provisoires qui ne seront sanctionnées par une garantie
formelle, que lorsque toutes présenteront un système général et
satisfaisant. Cette précaution était d'autant plus nécessaire que nous
voyons tous les jours le prince de Metternich soutenir avec plus de
chaleur et d'opiniâtreté la cause de Murat. Il le fait sous le
prétexte du danger qu'il y aurait de provoquer Murat à une guerre
révolutionnaire. M. de Metternich, tout en l'annonçant lui-même comme
chef des Jacobins en Italie, exagère d'abord son influence, et ne
veut pas convenir que pour paralyser le danger que présente cette
fermentation, il suffira d'en écarter le chef principal. Le fait est
qu'il veut ménager ses affections pour madame Murat, et qu'il croit
qu'en conservant cette famille sur le trône, il en disposera comme il
voudra pour tout ce qu'il projette de faire en Italie. Il est donc
nécessaire que M. de Noailles use de cette réserve, lorsqu'il s'agira
de signer les articles qui renferment la réunion de Gênes au Piémont.
La succession de la maison de Carignan, au reste a été stipulée et ne
souffre plus de contradiction.

C'est dans cet état de choses, que les grandes questions qui
concernent la Pologne et la Saxe, sont celles qui entravent toute la
marche des affaires, et nous ne croyons pas que leur solution soit
depuis huit jours beaucoup plus avancée. La circulaire du prince
Repnin a motivé de la part de lord Castlereagh et du cabinet de
Vienne, des notes assez fortes adressées au cabinet prussien et dans
lesquelles on déclare que la réunion de la Saxe n'était admise que
conditionnellement, comme les notes données précédemment à l'occasion
de l'occupation provisoire de la Saxe par les troupes prussiennes,
l'avaient exprimé, et que, si la Prusse ne voulait point coopérer à
faire régler en Pologne des limites établies dans l'intérêt des trois
puissances, la concession faite à l'égard de la Saxe devait être
regardée comme non avenue.

Lord Castlereagh et le prince de Metternich ont été conduits plus
loin. Ils se sont persuadé que si l'empereur de Russie et le roi de
Prusse résistaient à ces ouvertures, il serait nécessaire de se
préparer à les forcer à plus de modération.

On nous assure, en effet, que des mesures militaires ont été
concertées, et un plan de campagne même discuté entre les chefs
autrichiens et bavarois. La coopération de la France y est jugée
nécessaire. Mais ni le prince de Metternich ni lord Castlereagh n'ont
jugé à propos d'en parler ou d'en faire parler jusqu'ici aux
plénipotentiaires du roi au congrès.

On aurait lieu de s'en étonner, si on pouvait se convaincre que ces
mesures militaires portent un autre caractère que celui de simples
démonstrations, dans le genre des dernières mesures dont le prince de
Metternich aide si souvent sa politique. Il y a même des personnes,
qu'on peut croire instruites, lesquelles prétendent que lord
Castlereagh et le prince de Metternich n'ont point encore arrêté de
plan à ce sujet, et qu'ils ont peur d'être forcés de s'occuper de
pareilles mesures.

Cependant lord Castlereagh, soit qu'il sente le besoin d'opposer une
digue à l'ambition et aux intrigues russes et prussiennes, soit que
l'opinion de l'Angleterre et de toute l'Allemagne l'ait fait changer
de marche et de système, paraît décidé à provoquer la guerre à la
Russie, si elle ne modère ses prétentions, et il en a parlé à quelques
personnes, en annonçant que l'Angleterre fournirait des subsides. Ce
ministre et le prince de Metternich lui-même, par l'effet des
défiances qu'on porte gratuitement à la politique de la France, et les
craintes que l'on conserve qu'une coopération de cette puissance
puisse compromettre la situation de la Belgique et de la rive gauche
du Rhin, ne demanderont les secours de la France qu'à la dernière
extrémité. Nous pensons même que, s'il leur paraît possible de
l'éviter, ils le feront, et vous pouvez bien croire, monsieur le
comte, qu'on ne les provoquera pas à ce sujet.

L'expérience, au reste, a déjà appris à ces puissances qu'elles ne
peuvent écarter l'intervention de la France, et qu'elle leur est plus
utile que nuisible pour arranger les affaires de l'Europe.

A notre arrivée ici, le désir secret d'éloigner la France de toute
délibération, était manifeste. Elle participe maintenant à ce qui se
traite pour l'Italie, pour la Suisse; elle interviendra utilement dans
les divisions territoriales de l'Allemagne, et nous ne serions pas
étonnés que les arrangements relatifs à la Pologne ne se fassent que
lorsqu'elle y concourra. Pour l'en empêcher et nous contrarier, les
ennemis de la France répandent depuis quelques jours les bruits les
plus absurdes sur sa situation intérieure; et, ce qui a lieu de nous
étonner, c'est que ces bruits se trouvent répétés dans la
correspondance diplomatique des légations anglaise et autrichienne à
Paris. Parmi ces assertions soutenues avec adresse, nous citons celle
que le roi ne serait pas en état de se servir de son armée. Elle a pu
être combattue par la communication d'une lettre de M. le comte
Dupont[393] qui parle de l'état de l'armée de la manière la plus
satisfaisante et la plus positive, et le fait sans laisser la moindre
réplique à opposer. Les autres assertions tomberont dans l'oubli,
lorsque le temps en aura dévoilé l'intrigue.

  [393] Le général Dupont, qui était alors ministre de la guerre.

Les affaires d'Allemagne souffrent comme toutes les autres du retard
que les décisions de l'empereur de Russie leur fait éprouver, et là,
comme ailleurs, il cherche à intervenir pour aider ses vues
principales.

Nous avons eu l'honneur de vous mander que le projet de fédération en
douze articles que nous vous avons adressé par notre dernière dépêche
du 16, avait été modifié dans ses dispositions principales. Les
cabinets prussien et autrichien l'avaient communiqué dès son origine à
celui de Russie. Cette communication était restée sans réponse. Mais,
pour le flatter d'abord et pour égarer l'opinion en Allemagne, qui se
prononce si fortement contre la réunion de la Saxe, le cabinet russe a
cru utile de relever la possibilité d'intervenir dans les affaires
allemandes, et M. le comte de Nesselrode a fait une réponse dont nous
joignons ici la copie. Si la grande alliance est rompue par suite des
affaires de Pologne, on sent que cette note sera regardée comme non
avenue.

Il ne peut, en général, nous échapper que le véritable embarras des
puissances alliées au congrès tient à l'illusion dans laquelle elles
s'entretenaient, en croyant pouvoir régler les affaires de l'Europe
sur des _bases_ qu'elles nous ont annoncées arrêtées, et qui ne le
sont pas.

Nº 15 _bis_.--LES AMBASSADEURS DU ROI AU CONGRÈS, AU MINISTRE DES
AFFAIRES ÉTRANGÈRES A PARIS.

Vienne, le 24 novembre 1814.

Monsieur le comte,

Nous ajoutons à l'expédition de la dépêche en date d'hier la
communication d'une lettre qu'un des hommes principaux du bureau des
affaires étrangères de ce pays-ci a adressée à M. le duc de Dalberg,
en lui signalant un article de la _Gazette de France_ qui a fait
beaucoup de sensation et qu'on ne peut s'expliquer avoir pu être admis
par la censure des journaux à moins que, comme l'observe l'auteur de
la lettre, on ait voulu réconcilier l'opinion avec les persécuteurs
et les spoliateurs du roi de Saxe[394].

  [394] Voici cet article:

  «Après de longues indécisions, le sort de la Saxe paraît enfin
  irrévocablement fixé. Le roi Frédéric-Auguste descend du trône; ses
  États sont partagés entre l'Autriche, la Prusse et le duc de
  Saxe-Weimar. Beaucoup de voix s'élèveront pour déplorer
  l'instabilité des choses humaines. Quelques esprits réfléchis
  méditeront sur les décrets impénétrables de cette providence
  éternelle qui, selon l'expression empruntée à l'Écriture par un de
  nos plus grands poètes: «frappe et guérit, perd et ressuscite».
  (Racine, _Athalie_, acte III).--Les uns, dans la chute de la maison
  régnante, ne verront qu'une révolution; les autres y contempleront
  un retour à l'ordre. C'est pour les premiers, qu'un coup d'oeil sur
  l'origine et les divisions de cette famille illustre ne sera point
  sans utilité.

  »Le second électeur, Frédéric l'Affable ou le Pacifique, mort en
  1464, laissa deux fils, dont l'aîné, Ernest, fut la tige de la
  branche Ernestine, et le cadet Albert, celle de la branche
  Albertine. En vertu du droit reconnu de primogéniture,
  Jean-Frédéric, sixième électeur, régnait sans contestation, quand
  éclatèrent dans l'empire les troubles excités par la fameuse ligue
  de Smalcalde. Charles-Quint, à la tête d'une puissante armée
  commandée par le célèbre duc d'Albe, marcha contre les confédérés.
  La bataille de Muhlberg, donnée en 1547, fut décisive.
  Jean-Frédéric, l'âme de la ligue, tomba au pouvoir de l'empereur.
  Ce prince usa durement de la victoire. Une commission militaire,
  présidée par l'inflexible général espagnol osa condamner à mort
  l'électeur de Saxe comme rebelle à l'autorité impériale. C'était
  introduire une législation toute nouvelle dans l'empire germanique.
  L'illustre prisonnier, après avoir entendu la lecture de son arrêt,
  continua tranquillement sa partie d'échecs avec le prince Ernest de
  Brunswick: «C'est moins ma tête que mon électorat, dit-il, qui leur
  fait envie.» L'événement fit voir qu'il ne se trompait pas:
  Charles-Quint lui accorda la vie, mais dans la diète d'Augsbourg,
  en 1548, il le dépouilla de la dignité électorale, pour en revêtir
  le duc Maurice de Saxe, chef de la branche cadette ou Albertine. On
  ne laissa au malheureux Jean-Frédéric que la petite ville de Gotha
  où il était gardé à vue. Plus à plaindre encore que lui, son fils,
  accusé d'avoir tenté de rentrer dans le palais de ses pères à
  Dresde, est arrêté et conduit â Vienne comme un vil criminel.

  »Quoique redevable de sa nouvelle existence politique à la
  protection de Charles-Quint, l'usurpateur Maurice saisit avidement
  l'occasion de faire éclater en faveur du luthérianisme le zèle qui
  avait servi de prétexte à la spoliation de l'électeur légitime. Il
  souleva les protestants, conclut une alliance secrète avec Henri
  III, roi de France, fondit sur l'empereur et fut sur le point de
  s'emparer de sa personne dans les gorges du Tyrol. Il lui arracha
  le traité de Passau, en 1552.

  »Depuis cette époque, la branche Albertine a conservé l'électorat,
  tandis que la branche aînée ou Ernestine, réduite à des possessions
  très circonscrites, s'est divisée en un grand nombre de rameaux. On
  en a compté jusqu'à quatorze. Il n'en subsiste plus que six. Le
  premier est celui de Weimar; le duc de ce nom est donc l'héritier
  direct et naturel de l'électeur Jean-Frédéric, violemment et
  injustement dépossédé par Charles-Quint.

  »Malgré le laps du temps, les titres de ses descendants n'étaient
  point mis en oubli. Dans la courte apparition qu'il fit au congrès
  de Rastadt, Buonaparte dit un jour au ministre de l'électeur de
  Saxe, avec cette brusquerie qui lui était familière: «Quand donc
  votre maître compte-t-il restituer l'électoral à la branche
  Ernestine[B]?»

    [B] Quelques personnes prétendent que c'est à l'électeur lui-même,
    après la bataille d'Iéna, qu'il adressa ce singulier compliment.

  »Ce fut le même homme cependant, qui, par la suite, voulut que ce
  prince prît le titre de roi.

  »De ce jour datèrent toutes les infortunes de Frédéric-Auguste:
  entouré, enchaîné, il lui fallut oublier qu'il était Allemand pour
  faire cause commune avec l'oppresseur de l'Allemagne.
  L'extravagante expédition de Moscou fit entrevoir aux princes et
  aux peuples l'instant de leur délivrance. Le roi de Saxe se retira
  en Bohême, et là, sur un territoire neutre, jouissant enfin de sa
  liberté, il promit solennellement, dit-on, de joindre ses efforts à
  ceux des libérateurs de l'Europe. Des motifs, que nous ne voulons
  pas discuter ici, le déterminèrent à changer de résolution.

  »Napoléon, fugitif, l'abandonna sans ressources à la vengeance des
  souverains alliés. Frédéric-Auguste demanda à les voir; si nous en
  croyons l'unanimité des relations publiques, son voeu fut repoussé.

  »L'opinion publique qui est unanime relativement aux vertus privées
  de ce prince, est au contraire singulièrement partagée en ce qui
  concerne sa conduite politique. Les uns lui font un crime
  irrémissible de sa persévérance dans son alliance avec l'ennemi du
  genre humain; les autres seraient tentés de révérer en lui
  l'instrument dont s'est servi la Providence pour prolonger
  l'aveuglement de Napoléon. En effet, en mettant à sa disposition
  ses forteresses et ses troupes, le roi de Saxe lui a inspiré le fol
  espoir de conserver la ligne de l'Elbe. Pendant qu'il se
  complaisait dans l'absurde possession de Dresde, pendant qu'il
  sacrifiait des armées, longtemps invincibles, à garder et à couvrir
  cette inutile cité, tout se préparait pour la perte de ce
  conquérant insensé. S'il n'eût pas été maître des places de l'Elbe,
  il eût été contraint d'aller prendre position derrière le Rhin; et
  là, appuyé sur de nombreuses forteresses, assuré désormais de ses
  communications avec la France, il lui restait encore les moyens de
  traiter honorablement avec ses vainqueurs.

  »Ainsi la main invisible et toute-puissante abaisse ce qu'elle
  avait élevé, et relève ce qu'elle avait abaissé: ainsi après trois
  siècles, la branche Albertine tombe du trône qu'elle avait usurpé,
  et la branche Ernestine recouvre une partie de l'héritage qui lui
  avait été ravi. Les Français en plaignant le sort de
  Frédéric-Auguste respecteront en lui un prince issu du même sang
  que l'auguste princesse qui donna le jour à nos souverains
  bien-aimés Louis XVI et Louis XVIII.»

Dans une situation aussi importante qu'est celle où se trouve placé
le sort de ce souverain, au milieu des débats les plus difficiles sur
une pareille question, comment n'a-t-on pas fait connaître à ceux qui
dirigent les journaux le sens et l'esprit dans lesquels le
gouvernement croit qu'il faut diriger l'opinion, pour la gloire autant
que pour le véritable intérêt du roi et de la France?

Il importe de connaître l'origine et l'auteur de cet article inséré
dans le numéro 315 (11 novembre) de la _Gazette de France_. Il importe
également que le _Moniteur_ publie un article raisonné qui, sans être
officiel, discute la même question sous le rapport du droit et de
l'utilité. Le mémoire joint à la dépêche du 23 fournira à M. de
Reinhard[395] les matériaux pour sa rédaction.

  [395] M. Reinhard était alors placé à la tête de la chancellerie du
  département des affaires étrangères.

Nous l'avons fait circuler sous main et nous avons observé qu'il avait
produit quelque impression. Il s'agit de le changer de manière à ce
que l'insertion dans le _Moniteur_ ne paraisse pas être ce mémoire;
mais on peut faire usage des principes et du raisonnement qu'il
renferme.

Nous vous transmettons en même temps un article de la _Gazette
universelle_, qui paraît être sorti des bureaux autrichiens et
répondre à la fameuse circulaire du prince Repnin.

Il est bon de l'insérer dans le _Moniteur_, en y ajoutant qu'on se
plaît à le communiquer au public, comme digne de son attention et
renfermant les meilleurs principes. On pense que le petit coup de
patte donné à la France pourra être omis.

Nos journaux ont pour l'étranger une influence bien autrement forte
que celle que produisent les journaux des autres pays, parce qu'on
sait que les nôtres restent sous la surveillance et la mesure du
gouvernement.

Nous vous prions, monsieur le comte, de nous faire connaître le
résultat des informations que nous vous demandons.

L'importance de la question de la Saxe ne peut vous échapper. Les
principes que nous devons y soutenir sont les mêmes dont nous devons
nous servir pour mettre une digue à la marche de la Révolution, et
pour consacrer de nouveau les principes du droit des gens, sans
lesquels tout l'édifice social en Europe restera ébranlé.

Nº 13.--LE PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND AU ROI LOUIS XVIII.

Vienne, le 24 novembre 1814[396].

  [396] Variante: _25 novembre 1814_.

SIRE,

Aussitôt que nous eûmes proféré ici le mot de _principes_ et demandé
la réunion immédiate du congrès, on se hâta de répandre de tous côtés
le bruit que la France ne cessait point de regretter la rive gauche du
Rhin et la Belgique, et n'aurait de repos qu'après les avoir
recouvrées; que le gouvernement de Votre Majesté pouvait bien partager
ce voeu de la nation et de l'armée, ou que[397], s'il ne le partageait
pas, il ne serait pas assez fort pour y résister; que, dans les deux
suppositions, le péril était le même, qu'on ne pouvait donc trop se
prémunir contre la France; qu'il fallait lui opposer des barrières
qu'elle ne pût point franchir, coordonner à cette fin les arrangements
de l'Europe, et se tenir soigneusement en garde contre ses
négociateurs qui ne manqueraient pas de tout faire pour l'empêcher.
Nous nous trouvâmes tout à coup en butte à des préventions contre
lesquelles il nous a fallu lutter depuis deux mois. Nous avons réussi
à triompher de celles qui nous étaient le plus pénibles. On ne dit
plus qu'il nous ait été donné de doubles instructions (comme M. de
Metternich l'assurait au prince de Wrède); qu'il nous ait été prescrit
de parler dans un sens et d'agir dans un autre, et que nous ayons été
envoyés pour semer la discorde. Le public rend justice à Votre
Majesté. Il ne croit plus qu'elle ait d'arrière-pensée. Il applaudit à
son désintéressement. Il la loue d'avoir embrassé la défense des
principes. Il avoue que le rôle d'aucune autre puissance n'est aussi
honorable que le sien. Mais ceux à qui il importe que la France ne
cesse point d'être un sujet de défiance et de crainte n'en pouvant
exciter sous un prétexte en excitent sous un autre. Ils représentent
sa situation intérieure sous un jour alarmant. Malheureusement ils se
fondent sur des nouvelles de Paris, données par des hommes dont le
nom, la réputation et les fonctions imposent. Le duc de Wellington,
qui entretient avec lord Castlereagh une correspondance très active,
ne lui parle que de conspirations, de mécontentements secrets et de
murmures, sourds précurseurs d'orages prêts à éclater. L'empereur
Alexandre dit que ses lettres de Paris lui annoncent des troubles. De
son côté, M. de Vincent[398] mande à sa cour qu'il se prépare un
changement dans le ministère et qu'il en est sûr. On affecte de
regarder un changement de ministres comme un indice certain d'un
changement de système intérieur et extérieur. On en conclut que l'on
ne peut pas compter sur la France, et qu'on ne doit entrer dans aucun
concert avec elle.

  [397] Variante: _vu que_.

  [398] M. de Vincent était alors ambassadeur d'Autriche à Paris.

Nous avons beau réfuter ces nouvelles, citer des dates ou des faits
qui les détruisent, leur opposer celles que nous recevons nous-mêmes,
indiquer la source où j'ai lieu de croire que le duc de Wellington
prend les siennes, et montrer combien cette source est suspecte, on
veut établir qu'éloignés de Paris, nous ignorons ce qui s'y passe, ou
que nous avons intérêt de le cacher, et que le duc de Wellington et M.
de Vincent étant sur les lieux, sont mieux instruits ou plus sincères.

Je n'accuserai point lord Castlereagh d'avoir propagé les préventions
que nous avons eu à combattre, mais, soit qu'il les eût conçues de
lui-même, soit qu'elles lui aient été inspirées, il en était
certainement imbu plus que personne. La longue guerre que l'Angleterre
a eu à soutenir presque seule et le péril que cette guerre lui a fait
courir, ont produit[399] sur lui une impression si vive, qu'elle lui
ôte, pour ainsi dire, la liberté de juger à quel point les temps sont
changés. De toutes les craintes, la moins raisonnable aujourd'hui,
c'est, sans contredit, celle d'un retour du système continental.
Cependant, ceux qui ont avec lui des relations plus particulières,
assurent qu'il est toujours préoccupé de cette crainte et qu'il ne
croit pas pouvoir accumuler trop de précautions contre ce danger
imaginaire. Il croit encore être à Châtillon, traitant et voulant
traiter de la paix avec Bonaparte. Il est aisé de deviner l'effet que
doivent produire sur un esprit ainsi disposé les nouvelles du duc de
Wellington, qui devient ainsi lui-même un obstacle à cet accord qu'il
paraît regarder comme facile à établir entre lord Castlereagh et nous.

  [399] Variante: et le péril _dans lequel celle guerre l'a mise ont
  fait_.

J'ai provoqué cet accord de toutes manières, et avant que lord
Castlereagh quittât Londres, et lors de son passage à Paris, et depuis
que nous sommes à Vienne. S'il n'a point eu lieu, ce n'est pas
seulement à cause des préventions de lord Castlereagh, mais c'est
parce qu'il y avait une opposition réelle et absolue entre ses vues et
les nôtres. Votre Majesté nous a prescrit de défendre les principes.
La note du 11 octobre que j'ai eu l'honneur de lui envoyer[400] montre
quel respect lord Castlereagh a pour eux. Nous devons tout mettre en
oeuvre pour conserver le roi et le royaume de Saxe. Lord Castlereagh
veut à toute force traiter l'un comme un criminel condamné, dont lui,
Castlereagh, s'est constitué le juge, et sacrifier l'autre. Nous
voulons que la Prusse acquière ou conserve beaucoup du duché de
Varsovie, et lord Castlereagh le veut comme nous; mais, par des motifs
si différents, qu'il emploie pour perdre la Saxe, le même moyen que
nous pour la sauver. Il veut ainsi tourner contre nous l'appui que
nous lui aurons donné dans la question de la Pologne. Des volontés si
contraires sont impossibles à concilier.

  [400] Voir page 470.

J'ai parlé souvent, et à l'empereur Alexandre lui-même, du
rétablissement de la Pologne comme d'une chose que la France désirait
et qu'elle serait prête à soutenir. Mais je n'ai point demandé ce
rétablissement sans alternative, parce que lord Castlereagh ne l'a pas
lui-même demandé, parce que j'aurais été seul à faire cette demande et
que, par là, j'aurais aigri l'empereur Alexandre sans me faire un
mérite aux yeux des autres, et même j'aurais blessé l'Autriche qui,
jusqu'à présent du moins, ne veut pas de ce rétablissement.

Il n'y a pas deux jours que lord Castlereagh auquel je faisais
quelques reproches sur la manière dont il avait conduit les affaires
depuis deux mois, me répondit: «J'ai toujours pensé que quand on était
dans une ligue, il ne fallait pas s'en séparer.»--Il se croit donc
dans une ligue. Cette ligue n'est certainement qu'une suite de leurs
traités antérieurs à la paix. Or, comment espérer qu'il s'entende avec
ceux contre lesquels il avoue qu'il est ligué?

Les autres membres de la ligue ou coalition contre la France sont dans
un cas semblable au sien. La Russie et la Prusse n'attendent que de
l'opposition de notre part. L'Autriche peut désirer notre appui dans
les questions de la Pologne et de la Saxe[401]; mais son ministre le
désire bien moins pour ces deux objets qu'il ne redoute notre
intervention pour d'autres. Il sait combien nous avons l'affaire de
Naples à coeur, et il ne l'a guère moins à coeur lui-même, mais dans un
sens bien différent du nôtre. Je l'allai voir dimanche dernier en
sortant de dîner chez le prince Trautmansdorf. J'avais reçu la veille
une lettre d'Italie, où l'on me disait que Murat avait soixante-dix
mille hommes dont la plus grande partie était armée, grâce aux
Autrichiens qui lui avaient vendu vingt-cinq mille fusils. Je voulais
m'en expliquer avec M. de Metternich, ou du moins lui montrer que je
le savais. Je le mis sur l'affaire de Naples, et, comme nous étions
dans son salon avec beaucoup de monde, je lui offris de le suivre dans
son cabinet pour lui montrer la lettre que j'avais reçue. Il me dit
que rien ne pressait et que cette question reviendrait plus tard. Je
lui demandai s'il n'était donc pas décidé. Il me répondit qu'il
l'était, mais qu'il ne voulait pas mettre le feu partout à la fois; et
comme il alléguait, à son ordinaire, la crainte que Murat ne soulevât
l'Italie: «Pourquoi donc, lui dis-je, lui fournissez-vous des armes,
si vous le craignez? Pourquoi lui avez-vous vendu vingt-cinq mille
fusils?» Il nia le fait, et je m'y étais attendu; mais je ne lui
laissai pas la satisfaction de penser que ses dénégations m'eussent
persuadé. Après que je l'eus quitté, il se rendit à la redoute, car
c'est au bal et dans les fêtes qu'il consume les trois quarts de sa
journée, et il avait la tête tellement remplie de l'affaire de Naples,
qu'ayant trouvé une femme de sa connaissance, il lui dit qu'on le
tourmentait pour cette affaire de Naples, mais qu'il ne saurait y
consentir, qu'il avait égard à la situation d'un homme qui s'était
fait aimer dans le pays où il gouverne; que lui, d'ailleurs, aimait
passionnément la reine et était en relations continuelles avec elle.
Tout cela, et peut-être un peu davantage sur cet article, se disait
sous le masque. Il faut s'attendre à ce qu'il fera jouer tous les
ressorts imaginables pour que l'affaire de Naples ne soit pas traitée
au congrès, conformément à l'insinuation qu'il fit, il y a quelque
temps, dans une conférence, et dont j'ai eu l'honneur de rendre compte
à Votre Majesté.

  [401] Variante: _dans la question de la Pologne et dans celle de la
  Saxe_.

Les quatre cours alliées, ayant chacune quelque raison de craindre
l'influence que la France pourrait avoir dans le congrès, se sont
naturellement unies, et elles craignent de se rapprocher de nous
lorsqu'elles se divisent entre elles, parce que tout rapprochement
entraînerait des concessions qu'elles ne veulent pas faire.

L'amour-propre, comme de raison, s'en est aussi mêlé. Lord Castlereagh
se croyait en état de faire fléchir l'empereur de Russie, et il n'a
fait que l'aigrir.

Enfin, à ces motifs se joint toujours un sentiment de jalousie contre
la France. Les alliés croyaient l'avoir plus abattue; ils ne
s'attendaient pas à lui voir, et les meilleures finances, et la
meilleure armée de l'Europe. A présent ils le croient, ils le disent,
et ils en sont venus jusqu'à regretter d'avoir fait la paix de Paris,
à se la reprocher les uns aux autres, à ne pas comprendre par quel
enchantement ils avaient été amenés à la faire, et à le dire, même
dans les conférences et devant nous.

On ne peut donc raisonnablement s'attendre à ce que l'Angleterre et
l'Autriche se rapprochent réellement et sincèrement de nous, que dans
un cas d'extrême nécessité, tel que serait celui où leurs discussions
avec la Russie finiraient par une rupture ouverte.

Toutefois, malgré ces dispositions, les difficultés qu'elles nous font
éprouver, et celles que les lettres de Paris nous causent, les
puissances sont ici, vis-à-vis de nous, dans une situation d'égards et
même de condescendance telle que nous aurions pu difficilement
l'espérer il y a six semaines. Je puis dire qu'elles-mêmes en sont
étonnées.

Jusqu'ici l'empereur Alexandre n'a point fléchi.

Lord Castlereagh, personnellement piqué, quoiqu'il ait reçu récemment
une note de la Russie, douce d'expression, dit, mais non pas à nous,
que si l'empereur ne veut point s'arrêter à la Vistule, il faut l'y
forcer par la guerre; que l'Angleterre ne pourra fournir que fort peu
de troupes, à cause de la guerre d'Amérique[402]; mais qu'elle
fournira des subsides, et que les troupes hanovriennes et hollandaises
pourront être employées sur le bas Rhin.

  [402] L'Angleterre était en guerre avec les États-Unis depuis plus
  de deux ans. La déclaration de guerre du gouvernement de Washington
  (19 juin 1812) avait été provoquée par la prétention de
  l'Angleterre de faire respecter par les navires américains le
  blocus fictif des côtes de l'empire français, depuis Hambourg
  jusqu'à Saint-Sébastien sur l'Océan, et depuis Port-Vendres jusqu'à
  Cattaro sur la Méditerranée; et de plus, par le droit que
  s'attribuaient les Anglais de confisquer les marchandises ennemies
  sur les navires neutres.

Le prince de Schwarzenberg opine pour la guerre, disant qu'on la fera
maintenant avec plus d'avantages que quelques années plus tard.

On a même déjà fait un plan de campagne à la chancellerie de guerre;
et le prince de Wrède en a fait un de son côté.

L'Autriche, la Bavière et autres États allemands feraient marcher
trois cent vingt mille hommes.

Deux cent mille, sous les ordres du prince de Schwarzenberg, se
porteraient par la Moravie et la Gallicie sur la Vistule.

Cent vingt mille, commandés par le prince de Wrède, se porteraient de
la Bohême sur la Saxe qu'ils feraient soulever; et, de là, entre
l'Oder et l'Elbe. On formerait en même temps le siège de Glatz et de
Neiss.

La campagne ne commencerait qu'à la fin de mars.

Mais ce plan nécessite la coopération de cent mille Français, dont
moitié se porterait sur la Franconie pour empêcher les Prussiens de
tourner l'armée de Bohême, et l'autre moitié les occuperait sur le bas
Rhin.

Il faut donc s'attendre à ce que cette coopération, sur l'absolue
nécessité de laquelle les militaires n'ont qu'une voix, nous sera
demandée, si la guerre doit avoir lieu.

Mais, jusqu'à présent, ni lord Castlereagh ni M. de Metternich ne nous
parlent de guerre, et l'on assure même qu'il n'en a point été question
entre eux. Ce n'est qu'avec la Bavière qu'ils sont séparément entrés
en ouverture à ce sujet.

Soit qu'ils fondent encore quelque espérance sur la négociation, soit
qu'ils veuillent gagner du temps, ils la poursuivent. Lord Castlereagh
ayant échoué, ils ont voulu remettre de nouveau en scène le prince de
Hardenberg. Mais il ne put voir, ni avant-hier ni hier, l'empereur
Alexandre qui, quoique beaucoup mieux, garde encore la chambre, et je
ne crois pas qu'il l'ait vu aujourd'hui.

Les arrangements relatifs à Gênes sont convenus dans la commission
italienne. On est occupé de la rédaction, dont les commissaires ont
prié M. de Noailles de se charger. Les droits de la maison de Carignan
sont reconnus. M. de Noailles a eu par moi l'instruction de n'admettre
les arrangements faits pour le Piémont, que comme partie intégrantes
des arrangements à faire avec le concours de la France pour la
totalité de l'Italie. C'est une sorte de réserve que j'ai cru utile de
faire à cause de Naples.

Les affaires de la Suisse vont se traiter dans une commission dont M.
le duc de Dalberg est membre, ainsi que j'ai eu l'honneur de le mander
à Votre Majesté.

Celles de l'Allemagne sont suspendues par le refus de la Bavière et du
Wurtemberg de prendre part aux délibérations, jusqu'à ce que le sort
de la Saxe ait été fixé.

Mille raisons me font désirer d'être auprès de Votre Majesté. Mais je
me sens retenu ici par l'idée que je puis être ici plus utile à son
service, et par l'espoir qu'en dépit de tous les obstacles, nous
parviendrons à obtenir une bonne partie du moins de ce qu'elle a
voulu.

Je suis...

Nº 9 _ter_.--LE ROI LOUIS XVIII AU PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND.

Paris, le 26 novembre 1814.

Mon cousin,

J'ai reçu votre numéro 12, et je puis dire avec vérité que c'est le
premier qui m'ait satisfait, non que je ne l'aie toujours été de votre
marche et de votre façon de me rendre compte de l'état des choses,
mais parce que, pour la première fois, je vois surnager des idées de
justice. L'empereur de Russie a fait un pas rétrograde; et, en
politique comme en toute autre chose, jamais le premier pas ne fut le
dernier. Ce prince se tromperait cependant s'il croyait m'engager à
une alliance (politique s'entend) avec lui. Vous le savez, mon système
est: alliance générale, point de particulières. Celles-ci sont une
source de guerres; l'autre est un garant de paix; et, sans craindre la
guerre, la paix est l'objet de tous mes voeux. C'est pour l'avoir que
j'ai augmenté mon armée, que je vous ai autorisé à promettre mon
concours à l'Autriche et à la Bavière. Ces mesures ont commencé à
réussir. Je crois pouvoir espérer _otium cum dignitate_, et c'est bien
assez pour éprouver de la satisfaction.

Vous avez dit tout ce que j'aurais pu dire sur la note de lord
Castlereagh. Je m'explique la différence de son langage avec celui de
lord Wellington par leurs positions respectives: l'un suit des
instructions, l'autre en donne.

Je voudrais déjà voir les affaires d'Italie réglées, depuis les Alpes
jusqu'à Terracine: car je désire bien vivement l'importante
conséquence qui doit s'en suivre. Sur quoi, je prie Dieu qu'il vous
ait, mon cousin, en sa sainte et digne garde.

LOUIS.

Nº 16 _bis_.--LES AMBASSADEURS DU ROI AU CONGRÈS, AU MINISTRE DES
AFFAIRES ÉTRANGÈRES A PARIS.

Vienne, le 30 novembre 1814.

Monsieur le comte,

Aucune conférence générale n'a été tenue depuis notre dernière
dépêche. M. le prince de Metternich et M. le prince de Hardenberg sont
l'un et l'autre alités d'une fièvre de rhume.

L'affaire de Gênes, en attendant, a été ajustée et terminée. Les actes
vont être signés et le prochain courrier en portera des copies au
département. M. de Corsini a été chargé de répondre au mémoire de M.
de Labrador, qui réclamait la Toscane pour le roi d'Étrurie. La
discussion sur cette affaire va avoir lieu, et nous craignons que la
reine d'Étrurie n'arrive qu'avec beaucoup de peine à rentrer dans cet
ancien patrimoine de sa famille. Lord Castlereagh s'en est exprimé
ainsi.

Une séance pour arranger les affaires de la Suisse a eu lieu, et le
plénipotentiaire français y a été appelé.

On a écouté les réclamations du canton de Berne, mais on n'a encore
rien conclu. On paraît en général être bien disposé pour le canton de
Berne, mais ne pas vouloir renverser l'existence des dix-neuf cantons,
garantie par l'acte fédéral. On portera à la connaissance du roi les
résultats des conférences à mesure que la discussion les amènera.

L'autorisation que le roi a donnée pour l'échange d'une partie du pays
de Gex servira utilement. Nous observons cependant que, dans cette
circonstance, il n'est plus question d'une spoliation du prince évêque
de Bâle, qui, déjà en 1803, lors du recès de l'empire d'Allemagne, a
perdu ses droits de souveraineté, a obtenu une pension de cent vingt
mille francs et exerce toujours ses droits spirituels[403].

  [403] L'évêché de Bâle était autrefois un État en partie
  indépendant. L'évêque, prince du Saint-Empire depuis 1356,
  possédait, à titre de vassal de l'empire, les places de Porentruy,
  Delemont et Laufen avec leur territoire, le tout incorporé au
  cercle du Haut-Rhin. En outre, il était souverain indépendant des
  villes de Bienne, Neuveville, des seigneuries de Tessemberg,
  d'Erguel et d'Illfingen. En 1792, la Révolution transforma l'évêché
  en république de Rauracie qui ne dura que quelques mois. En 1793,
  les districts de Delemont et de Porentruy furent réunis à la
  France; en 1797, l'Erguel et le Val-Moutiers subirent le même sort.
  Le reste de ses États fut sécularisé en 1803 moyennant une pension
  de dix mille florins. En 1815, l'ancien évêché de Bâle fut adjugé
  par le congrès de Vienne au canton de Berne, à l'exception de douze
  communes qui furent données au canton de Bâle, et d'un district qui
  fut concédé à Neuchâtel.

Les conférences allemandes ont été suspendues. Le Wurtemberg et la
Bavière n'ont pas voulu concourir à river les chaînes qu'on leur
préparait. Une réponse faite par les cabinets autrichien et prussien
aux plénipotentiaires wurtembourgeois a augmenté la défiance à cet
égard. Nous en joignons ici une copie et une traduction française.

Les petits et moyens États de l'Allemagne ont, en attendant, formé une
seconde association et le grand-duc de Bade s'y est joint par l'effet
d'un avis qui lui a été donné à ce sujet par l'impératrice de Russie,
sa soeur.

Quant aux affaires polonaise et saxonne, elles sont dans la même
situation, et à aucune époque du congrès, les puissances alliées n'ont
donné à la France une plus entière conviction de leur désunion
qu'elles ne le font dans ce moment, où l'Angleterre, l'Autriche, la
Russie et la Prusse ne paraissent d'accord sur aucune des bases qui
devaient servir à l'arrangement général de l'Europe.

L'attitude que la France a prise la place de manière à attendre avec
calme le résultat de ces intrigues, et de n'y paraître que pour faire
écouter le langage de la raison. C'est dans cet esprit qu'il nous
semblerait utile de diriger quelques articles de gazettes, contre la
doctrine du _Correspondant de Nuremberg_ et du _Mercure du Rhin_, qui,
l'un et l'autre, se plaisent à altérer les faits et à nourrir
l'animosité qui règne en Allemagne contre la France.

Agréez...

Nº 14.--LE PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND AU ROI LOUIS XVIII.

Vienne, le 30 novembre 1814.

SIRE,

J'ai reçu la lettre dont Votre Majesté a daigné m'honorer le 15 de ce
mois, et, par le même courrier, l'autorisation qu'elle a bien voulu me
donner pour consentir à l'échange d'une petite portion du pays de
Gex, contre une partie du Porentruy.

L'ancien prince évêque de Bâle a déjà repris, comme évêque,
l'administration spirituelle du Porentruy, mais il ne saurait, comme
prince, en recouvrer la possession qu'il a perdue, non par le simple
fait de la conquête, mais par la sécularisation générale des États
ecclésiastiques de l'Allemagne en 1803. Il jouit comme prince d'une
pension de soixante mille florins, et ne prétend à rien de plus. Il ne
peut donc pas être un obstacle à l'échange dont nous avons eu
l'honneur d'entretenir Votre Majesté. Mais cet échange pourrait être
rendu difficile par l'une des conditions dont Votre Majesté le fait
dépendre, savoir: la restitution de l'Argovie bernoise au canton de
Berne, car, selon toute apparence, cette restitution éprouvera de très
grandes et peut-être même d'insurmontables difficultés. Je suppose
toutefois que, si l'on se bornait à restituer à Berne quelques
bailliages de l'Argovie, qu'en compensation du surplus on lui donnât
les parties de l'évêché de Bâle comprises dans les anciennes limites
de la Suisse, et que Berne se contentât de cet arrangement, Votre
Majesté en serait contente elle-même.

La commission chargée des affaires de la Suisse n'a fait, jusqu'à
présent, autre chose que se convaincre que la multiplicité et la
divergence des prétentions, les rendaient fort épineuses. Ceux qui,
dans l'origine, les voulaient régler seuls, et nous contestaient le
droit de nous en mêler, ont été les premiers à demander notre
concours, et, pour ainsi dire notre assistance et nos conseils. Il est
vrai que les envoyés suisses qui sont ici, et qui, dès les premiers
temps de notre séjour à Vienne, se sont liés avec nous, leur ont
déclaré que s'ils croyaient pouvoir établir en Suisse un ordre de
choses solide, sans l'intervention et même sans l'assistance[404] de
la France, ils se berçaient d'une espérance tout à fait vaine.

  [404] Variante: _l'assentiment_.

Quand les alliés traitaient de la paix et la voulaient faire avec
Bonaparte[405], ils s'étaient adressés aux cantons qui avaient le plus
souffert des révolutions de la Suisse, réveillant en eux le souvenir
et le sentiment de leurs pertes, et leur offrant la perspective de les
réparer. Leur but était de détacher la Suisse de la France et ce moyen
leur paraissait infaillible. Mais il s'est trouvé que ces cantons
étaient précisément ceux qui étaient le plus attachés à la maison de
Bourbon. Alors les alliés ne se sont plus souciés d'un moyen qui ne
menait plus et qui, même, était contraire à leur but, et ils n'ont
recueilli de leurs tentatives que l'embarras de savoir comment ils
reviendraient sur leurs pas et parviendraient à tout calmer.
Quelques-uns avaient formé le projet d'unir dans une même ligue[406]
la Suisse et l'Allemagne. C'est encore une idée abandonnée[407]. On
paraît maintenant vouloir d'assez bonne foi terminer, en satisfaisant
aux prétentions les plus considérables et les plus justes, et en
faisant d'ailleurs le moins de changements qu'il est possible. Il est
donc permis d'espérer qu'il y aura pour la Suisse un arrangement,
sinon le meilleur en soi, du moins le meilleur que les circonstances
permettent; que l'on déclarera l'indépendance de ce pays, et, ce qui
n'est pas moins important pour nous, sa neutralité.

  [405] Variante: _Buonaparte_.

  [406] Variante: _de réunir dans la même ligue_.

  [407] Variante: _C'est une idée abandonnée_.

La commission pour les affaires d'Italie a fait, sur celle de Gênes,
un rapport et un projet d'articles qui seront signés demain et
adressés aux huit puissances. J'aurai l'honneur d'envoyer à Votre
Majesté, par le prochain courrier, une copie de ce projet. Après les
affaires de Gênes viendront celles de Parme qui souffriront plus de
difficultés, s'il est vrai, comme on le rapporte, que l'empereur
d'Autriche et M. de Metternich aient donné récemment des assurances
positives à l'archiduchesse Marie-Louise, qu'elle conserverait Parme.
Ce qui est certain, c'est que l'archiduchesse, qui, jusqu'à présent,
avait eu sur ses voitures, les armes de son mari, a fait peindre sur
l'une les armes du duché de Parme. J'espère néanmoins qu'on parviendra
à le faire rendre à la reine d'Étrurie.

C'est à Venise qu'ont été pris les vingt-cinq mille fusils vendus à
Murat. Il paraît que, malgré la protection de M. de Metternich, il ne
se sent pas fort rassuré, car il vient d'écrire à l'archiduchesse
Marie-Louise une longue lettre dans laquelle il lui annonce, entre
autres choses, que si l'Autriche lui prête son appui pour rester à
Naples, il va la faire remonter au rang d'où elle n'aurait jamais dû
descendre. (Ces termes sont textuels.) Une telle extravagance, même
dans un homme de son pays et de son caractère, ne peut s'expliquer que
comme un excès de la peur qui se trahit elle-même.

Les conférences de la commission allemande sont toujours suspendues.
Le Wurtemberg a déclaré qu'il ne pouvait point avoir d'opinion
quelconque sur des parties d'un tout qu'on ne lui montrait que l'une
après l'autre et isolées, et qu'il ne délibérerait sur aucune, avant
qu'on lui eût fait connaître l'ensemble, ce qui lui a attiré de la
part de l'Autriche et de la Prusse une note où ces deux puissances
font assez sentir l'espèce d'empire qu'elles veulent, en se la
partageant, exercer sur l'Allemagne.

Persuadés que l'influence ainsi partagée entre deux puissances se
convertirait bientôt en domination et en souveraineté, tous les États
de l'ancienne confédération rhénane, à l'exception de la Bavière et du
Wurtemberg, se sont réunis pour exprimer le voeu du rétablissement de
l'ancien empire germanique, dans la personne de celui qui en était le
chef.

Ces mêmes États sont sur le point de former une ligue dont l'objet
sera d'opposer une résistance de non consentement et d'inertie au
système que l'Autriche et la Prusse voudraient faire prévaloir. Le
grand-duc de Bade, qui d'abord s'était tenu isolé, s'est joint aux
autres, par le conseil de l'impératrice de Russie, sa soeur, qui n'a
été que l'organe de l'empereur Alexandre.

Les affaires de Pologne et de Saxe sont toujours dans la même
situation; la démarche que M. de Metternich avait fait faire par M. de
Hardenberg, et que lord Castlereagh n'a point approuvée, ayant été
sans résultat, aussi bien que la discussion de lord Castlereagh avec
l'empereur Alexandre.

J'ai l'honneur d'adresser à Votre Majesté les pièces de cette
discussion, au nombre de six. Il me manque encore une lettre que
j'aurai et que j'ai lue. C'est la dernière lettre de l'empereur
Alexandre, où il dit à lord Castlereagh que c'en est assez, et
l'invite à prendre désormais la voie officielle.

Ceux qui ont lu ces pièces ne comprennent pas comment lord
Castlereagh, s'étant mis aussi en avant qu'il l'a fait, pourrait
reculer; mais lui-même ne comprend pas comment et dans quelle
direction il peut faire un pas de plus.

Au reste, Votre Majesté verra que lord Castlereagh ne s'est occupé que
de la Pologne, décidé qu'il était à sacrifier la Saxe, par une suite
de cette politique qui ne voit que des masses, sans s'embarrasser des
éléments qui servent à les former. C'est une politique d'écoliers et
de coalisés.

Je dois faire à Votre Majesté la même prière pour ces pièces que pour
celles que j'ai déjà eu l'honneur de lui adresser. Je les ai eues de
la même manière que celles-ci, et sous les mêmes conditions.

L'empereur Alexandre témoigne l'intention de se rapprocher de nous. Il
se plaint de ceux qui, depuis que nous sommes ici, et dans les
premiers temps surtout, se sont comme interposés entre lui et nous, et
il désigne MM. de Metternich et de Nesselrode. L'intermédiaire dont il
se sert avec moi est le prince Adam Czartoryski, qui a maintenant le
plus de part à sa confiance et qu'il a fait entrer dans son conseil,
où M. de Nesselrode n'est plus appelé, et qu'il a composé du prince
Adam, du comte Capo d'Istria et de M. de Stein.

L'empereur est rétabli et sort. M. de Metternich est malade; il n'est
sorti ni hier ni aujourd'hui[408], ce qui fait qu'il ne peut y avoir
de réunion des ministres des huit puissances.

  [408] Variante: _et ne s'est point levé_ ni hier ni aujourd'hui.

Lord Castlereagh est venu me proposer ce matin de profiter de ce temps
d'inaction pour nous occuper de l'affaire des noirs. Mais, tout en
plaisantant sur sa proposition et sur les motifs[409] qu'il avait de
la faire, je lui ai si positivement dit que cette affaire devait être
la dernière de toutes, et qu'il fallait que celles de l'Europe fussent
faites avant de s'occuper de l'Afrique, que j'espère qu'il ne me
donnera pas l'occasion de le lui répéter une seconde fois.

Nº 10 _ter_.--LE ROI LOUIS XVIII AU PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND.

Paris, ce 4 décembre 1814.

Mon cousin,

J'ai reçu votre numéro 13. Toujours également satisfait de votre
conduite, je le suis, et vous n'en serez pas surpris, fort peu de
l'état des affaires, qui me semble bien éloigné de celui où elles
étaient lorsque vous avez expédié le numéro 12. Dieu seul est maître
des volontés; les hommes n'y peuvent rien, et quoi[410] qu'il en
puisse être, en me tenant fortement attaché aux principes; en méritant
peut-être qu'on me fasse l'application du vers: _Justum et tenacem
propositi virum_, l'honneur au moins me restera, et c'est ce que
j'ambitionne le plus.

  [410] Variante: _mais_ quoi qu'il.

Je ne suis pas surpris des bruits qui courent, des nouvelles que l'on
mande et de la consistance que leur donne la mauvaise volonté;
moi-même, il ne tiendrait qu'à moi de ne pas avoir un moment de repos;
et cependant mon sommeil est aussi paisible que dans ma jeunesse. La
raison en est simple: je n'ai jamais cru que, passé les premiers
instants de la Restauration, le mélange de tant d'éléments hétérogènes
ne produisît pas de fermentation. Je sais qu'il en existe, mais je ne
m'en inquiète point. Résolu à ne jamais m'écarter au dehors de ce que
me prescrit l'équité, au dedans de la constitution que j'ai donnée à
mon peuple, à ne jamais mollir dans l'exercice de mon autorité
légitime, je ne crains rien, et, un peu plus tôt ou un peu plus tard,
je verrai se dissiper ces nuages, dont j'avais prévu la formation.

On vous parle de changements dans le ministère, et moi je vous en
annonce. Je rends toute justice au zèle et aux bonnes qualités du
comte Dupont; mais je n'ai pas à me louer également de son
administration; en conséquence, je viens de lui retirer son
département, que je confie au maréchal Soult. Je donne celui de la
marine au comte Beugnot[411], et la direction générale de la police à
M. d'André[412]. Mais ces déplacements partiels de confiance, dont
j'ai voulu que vous fussiez le premier instruit, ne changent rien au
système de politique qui est _le mien_; c'est ce que vous aurez bien
soin de dire hautement à quiconque vous parlera de ce qui se passe
aujourd'hui.

  [411] Le ministère de la marine était vacant depuis la mort de son
  titulaire, M. Malouet (7 septembre).

  [412] Antoine-Balthazar-Joseph d'André, né à Aix en 1759,
  conseiller au parlement de Provence en 1778, député de la noblesse
  aux états généraux, président de l'Assemblée constituante (août
  1790); il siégea dans les rangs des constitutionnels. En 1792,
  poursuivi comme accapareur, il se réfugia en Angleterre, et passa
  de là en Allemagne (1796). Il ne revint en France qu'en 1814, fut
  nommé directeur général de la police, puis intendant de la maison
  du roi. Il mourut en 1825.

Je serai très aise de vous revoir, quand il en sera temps; mais les
raisons qui m'ont déterminé à me priver de vos services près de moi
subsistent avec une force accrue par les difficultés mêmes que vous
éprouvez. Il est donc nécessaire que vous continuiez aussi bien que
vous faites à me représenter au congrès jusqu'à sa dissolution. Sur
quoi je prie Dieu qu'il vous ait, mon cousin, en sa sainte et digne
garde.

LOUIS.

Nº III.--LE COMTE DE BLACAS D'AULPS AU PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND.

Paris, ce 4 décembre 1814.

Prince[413], la lettre que le roi a reçue de vous par le courrier qui
n'avait pu m'apporter la réponse à celle que j'ai eu l'honneur de vous
écrire, le 9 du mois dernier, m'avait déjà fourni d'importantes
lumières sur les principaux objets traités dans la lettre que vous
avez bien voulu m'adresser le 23. Sa Majesté avait eu la bonté de me
communiquer votre dépêche ainsi que la note de lord Castlereagh, et il
est impossible, comme vous l'observez, de ne pas être frappé de la
différence qui existe entre le style de cette note et le langage du
duc de Wellington.

  [413] Variante: _La lettre, prince_.

Je ne puis cependant[414], je l'avoue, fixer encore mes idées sur les
causes réelles de cette différence. Le roi répugne à ne l'attribuer
qu'à un système d'artifice dont le but serait la déconsidération de la
France. Lord Wellington, par des communications officieuses telles que
celle dont je vous ai parlé au sujet des relations de Naples avec
Paris, et par la conduite qu'il a tenue dernièrement à l'occasion
d'une correspondance saisie sur lord Oxford[415], a montré des
dispositions que ne pourrait guère motiver le projet unique[416] de
répandre au loin des craintes chimériques. Il serait au reste possible
que, s'exagérant à lui-même des périls dont quelques rumeurs trop
généralement accueillies ne cessent d'épouvanter les esprits timides,
il eût souvent desservi, sans le vouloir, la politique du roi, ou
peut-être favorisé par là des intentions moins franches que les
siennes. Ce qu'il y a de certain, c'est que plusieurs circonstances,
indépendantes des vues de l'Angleterre, n'ont que trop fourni de
prétextes aux défiances propres à encourager les opinions fâcheuses
dont vous redoutez l'effet. Vous savez, prince, et vous avez souvent
déploré avec moi le peu d'assurance que donnait au gouvernement de Sa
Majesté le défaut de vigueur et d'ensemble des opérations[417]
ministérielles. Ce vice, dont la connaissance était restée quelque
temps concentrée dans le cabinet, ne pouvait manquer à la longue
d'acquérir une malheureuse publicité. Joignez à cela le mécontentement
de l'armée dont les plaintes n'ont cessé de frapper les oreilles des
princes, pendant leurs voyages[418] dans les départements; le malaise
qu'entretenaient toutes les réclamations contre l'insuffisance de la
police; enfin les délations multipliées contre des hommes que leurs
intentions et leurs discours signalent, peut-être sans fondement, mais
non sans vraisemblance, comme les instigateurs des complots les plus
dangereux; tout, jusqu'aux mesures de sûreté que le dévouement des
commandants militaires a rendues trop ostensibles, a dû produire une
impression dont les étrangers peuvent profiter sans y avoir concouru.

  [414] Variante: _toutefois_.

  [415] Édouard Harley comte d'Oxford, né en 1773, mort en 1849, issu
  de la famille de l'homme d'État anglais de ce nom (1661-1724). Ce
  titre est éteint aujourd'hui.--Lord Oxford résidait alors à Naples
  sans aucun titre officiel. Il était en relation suivie avec Murat
  et sa cour, ce qui excita les défiances du gouvernement français.
  Aussi comme le comte passait par Paris pour retourner en Angleterre
  se saisit-on d'un prétexte quelconque pour l'arrêter. On trouva
  dans ses papiers plusieurs lettres du roi de Naples, mais on y
  chercha en vain des preuves d'une conspiration entre Murat et
  Napoléon.

  [416] Variante: motiver _uniquement le projet de répandre_.

  [417] Variante: _dans les_ opérations.

  [418] Variante: pendant _toute la durée de leurs voyages_.

Cet état de choses vous expliquera, prince, les motifs impérieux
auxquels le roi a pensé devoir céder en faisant un changement partiel
dans son ministère. C'est hier que Sa Majesté a fait connaître sa
résolution sur cet objet. Tout en rendant justice au zèle et aux
bonnes intentions de M. le comte Dupont, elle a reconnu que l'armée,
imputant des torts que peut-être, à ce ministre, les embarras du
moment rendaient inévitables[419], appelait de tous ses voeux un autre
système, et le roi a jeté les yeux sur le maréchal Soult[420] pour lui
confier le portefeuille de la guerre. Ce choix dans lequel Sa Majesté
a été dirigée par le désir de rétablir dans les troupes la soumission,
la confiance et le zèle, si nécessaires au maintien de la puissance
nationale, vous paraîtra sans doute conforme aux principes qu'elle a
invariablement suivis.

  [419] Variante: _imputant peut-être à ce ministre des torts que les
  embarras du moment rendaient inévitables_.

  [420] Variante: sur _M. le duc de Dalmatie_.

Le ministère de la marine donné au comte Beugnot et la direction[421]
de la police à M. d'André sont les autres mutations dans lesquelles le
roi a voulu chercher les moyens de remplir l'attente publique.

  [421] Variante: la direction _générale_.

Vous penserez sans doute, prince, que ce changement peu considérable
lorsqu'on l'envisage dans son rapport avec la composition du conseil,
n'en doit pas moins amener des résultats importants. En effet,
l'esprit de l'armée et la sécurité de la police sont devenus tellement
les principes conservateurs de l'opinion, que, sous ce point de vue,
la détermination du roi acquiert le plus grand intérêt. C'est à vous
que Sa Majesté s'en remet pour présenter à Vienne cet événement sous
son véritable jour, et pour le faire considérer non comme une
révolution ministérielle, mais plutôt comme un accroissement de force
et de lumière dans le gouvernement.

Le roi regrette vivement qu'au lieu d'avoir à confier cette tâche à
vos soins, il ne puisse vous voir auprès de lui, offrir une preuve de
plus à l'appui de l'opinion favorable qu'il veut[422] donner de son
ministère. Mais Sa Majesté sent les effets avantageux qu'ont produits
vos continuels efforts[423]. Il serait, au reste, possible que les
affaires, prenant une marche plus rapide vous retinssent moins de
temps que vous ne nous le faites craindre, et je le désire
vivement[424].

  [422] Variante: _désire_.

  [423] Variante: _Sa Majesté sent néanmoins toute la vérité des
  observations que vous lui faites sur l'effet avantageux qu'ont
  produit vos continuels efforts_.

  [424] Variante: _et pour moi je désire fort que votre retour soit
  plus prochain que vous ne semblez l'espérer_.

_Les dernières nouvelles d'Espagne ne sont point bonnes. Le comte
de Jaucourt vous informe certainement des rapports que M.
d'Agoult[425] vient de lui adresser._

  [425] Hector d'Agoult, secrétaire d'ambassade à Madrid.

_Rien n'est encore décidé ici pour le moment de l'ajournement des
Chambres_[426].

  [426] La fin de cette lettre ne se trouve pas dans le texte des
  archives.

Recevez, prince, avec amitié une nouvelle assurance de mon bien
sincère et invariable attachement.

Nº 17 _bis_.--LES AMBASSADEURS DU ROI AU CONGRÈS, AU MINISTRE DES
AFFAIRES ÉTRANGÈRES A PARIS.

Vienne, le 7 décembre 1814.

Monsieur le comte,

Nous avons l'honneur de vous adresser le rapport de la commission sur
la formation du royaume de Sardaigne; il a été rédigé par M. le comte
de Noailles.

Il est probable que dans une prochaine séance qui réunira les
plénipotentiaires des huit puissances signataires du traité de Paris,
tout ce qui reste à décider sur cet objet sera définitivement arrêté,
savoir:

1º La reconnaissance solennelle de l'hérédité de la maison de
Sardaigne dans celle de Savoie-Carignan;

2º Le titre de roi de Sardaigne en prenant possession de l'État de
Gênes;

3º La disposition à faire des fiefs impériaux.

Nous avons également l'honneur d'adresser au département deux notes
allemandes, dont l'une est celle que la cour de Wurtemberg a donnée
au comité allemand. Elle a provoqué la réponse que les cabinets de
Prusse et d'Autriche ont faite, et dont notre précédente dépêche
renfermait une copie.

La seconde note est celle que la cour de Wurtemberg a présentée pour
expliquer les motifs qui l'ont guidée dans la rédaction de la
première. Les affaires d'Allemagne, au reste, sont toutes en suspens
et attendent la décision de celle de la Saxe qui flotte toujours dans
l'incertitude. De part et d'autre, on ne paraît pas s'être rapproché.

Les conférences suisses ont commencé. M. de Dalberg défend le mieux
qu'il lui est possible les intérêts du canton de Berne, et quoique les
puissances aient arrêté l'intégrité des dix-neuf cantons, on pourra
procurer quelques avantages à ce canton, au moyen de l'évêché de Bâle.
M. de Dalberg en rendra compte dans un rapport général, lorsqu'il y
aura quelque chose de définitivement arrêté.

Agréez...

Nº 15.--LE PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND AU ROI LOUIS XVIII.

Vienne, le 7 décembre 1814.

SIRE,

Cette lettre que j'ai l'honneur d'écrire à Votre Majesté sera courte.
Je ne sais que depuis un moment les faits dont je vais lui rendre
compte. Je les substitue à d'autres moins intéressants et plus vagues
que j'avais recueillis.

On me dit, et j'ai toute raison de croire, qu'un courrier arrivé cette
nuit, a apporté à lord Castlereagh et à M. de Munster l'ordre de
soutenir la Saxe. (J'ignore encore jusqu'où, et si c'est dans toute
hypothèse, ou seulement, dans une supposition donnée.) On ajoute que
dès ce matin lord Castlereagh a adressé à M. de Metternich une note
qui le lui annonce, et que le comte de Munster qui a toujours été,
mais un peu timidement de notre avis sur la Saxe, va se prononcer sur
cette question avec beaucoup de force. Le prince de Wrède doit avoir
lu la note de lord Castlereagh chez M. de Metternich.

Avant-hier matin, M. de Metternich eut avec l'empereur Alexandre un
entretien dans lequel on mit de part et d'autre le plus qu'on put de
subtilités et de ruses, et qui n'aboutit à rien. Mais comme M. de
Metternich avait déclaré que son maître ne consentirait jamais à
abandonner la Saxe à la Prusse, l'empereur Alexandre voulant s'assurer
s'il lui avait dit la vérité, aborda, le soir, après le carrousel,
l'empereur François et lui dit: «Dans le temps actuel, nous autres
souverains, nous sommes obligés de nous conformer au voeu des peuples
et de le suivre. Le voeu du peuple saxon est de ne point être partagé.
Il aime mieux appartenir tout entier à la Prusse, que si la Saxe était
divisée ou morcelée.» L'empereur François lui répondit: «Je n'entends
rien à cette doctrine. Voici quelle est la mienne: un prince peut,
s'il le veut, céder une partie de son pays; il ne peut pas céder tout
son pays et tout son peuple. S'il abdique, son droit passe à ses
héritiers légitimes. Il ne peut pas les en priver et l'Europe entière
n'en a pas le droit.--Cela n'est pas conforme aux lumières du siècle,
dit l'empereur Alexandre.--C'est mon opinion, répliqua l'empereur
d'Autriche, ce doit être celle de tous les souverains et
conséquemment la vôtre. Pour moi, je ne m'en départirai jamais.»

Cette conversation, qui m'a été rapportée de la même manière par deux
personnes différentes, est un fait sûr. On avait donc eu raison de
dire que l'empereur d'Autriche avait sur l'affaire de la Saxe une
opinion qui ne laissait plus à M. de Metternich le choix de la
défendre ou de l'abandonner, et ce n'était pas sans fondement que le
ministre saxon se flattait qu'elle ne serait point abandonnée.

On prétend que l'empereur Alexandre a dit qu'une seule conversation
avec l'empereur François valait mieux que dix conversations avec M. de
Metternich, parce que le premier s'exprimait nettement et qu'on savait
à quoi s'en tenir.

Les princes d'Allemagne, qui se sont réunis pour aviser au moyen de
défendre leurs droits contre les projets qu'ils connaissent ou qu'ils
supposent à la commission chargée des affaires allemandes, vont, je
l'espère, émettre un voeu motivé pour la conservation de la Saxe; le
maréchal de Wrède, auquel la plupart se sont adressés, leur a dit
qu'ils devaient se presser, et que le moment était favorable. Il leur
a promis que la Bavière y donnerait son adhésion.

Le Wurtemberg, au contraire, se range pour le moment du côté de la
Prusse. C'est le prince royal, amoureux de la grande-duchesse
Catherine, qui a influé sur cette nouvelle disposition du cabinet. La
cour de Stuttgard fait en cela une chose vile, qui ne lui profitera
pas, et ne nuira guère qu'à elle. Cette conduite si peu loyale et si
peu noble, pour ne rien dire de plus, du roi de Wurtemberg, ne me
paraît pas très propre à faire désirer bien vivement de devenir son
neveu[427]. Je prierai Votre Majesté de me permettre de lui parler un
jour plus longuement de l'objet que je rappelle ici.

  [427] Si le duc de Berry avait épousé la grande-duchesse Anne, il
  serait devenu le neveu du roi de Wurtemberg. Celui-ci, en effet,
  était le frère de Sophie-Dorothée, princesse de Wurtemberg, qui
  avait épousé l'empereur Paul. La grande-duchesse Anne était la
  dernière fille de Paul Ier. Cette princesse après avoir été sur le
  point d'épouser l'empereur Napoléon en 1810, puis le duc de Berry
  en 1814, s'unit en 1815 au prince d'Orange, qui devint plus tard
  roi des Pays-Bas sous le nom de Guillaume II.

L'empereur de Russie avait voulu me voir; puis, il a voulu auparavant
éclaircir des idées confuses dont il m'a fait dire par le prince Adam
Czartoryski que sa tête était embarrassée. Je n'ai pu me servir auprès
de lui du général Pozzo, qui est avec lui médiocrement. Ses serviteurs
d'ailleurs ne le voient qu'avec difficulté. Il a fallu que le duc de
Richelieu[428] attendît un mois entier une audience. Le prince Adam,
quoique partie intéressée dans nos discussions, est mon intermédiaire
le plus utile. Je n'ai point encore vu l'empereur. On me dit qu'il est
ébranlé, mais toujours indécis. J'ignore quand et à quoi il se fixera.

  [428] Armand du Plessis, duc de Richelieu, petit-fils du maréchal
  de ce nom. Né en 1766, il était, en 1789, premier gentilhomme de la
  chambre. Il émigra la même année, se rendit d'abord à Vienne, puis
  prit du service dans l'armée russe et reçut de l'impératrice
  Catherine le grade de lieutenant général (1790). Il revint un
  instant en France, en 1802, mais retourna en Russie en 1803, et fut
  nommé, par l'empereur Alexandre, gouverneur d'Odessa, puis de toute
  la nouvelle Russie. Il conserva ces hautes fonctions jusqu'en 1814.
  De retour à Paris, il reprit sa charge à la cour et devint, en
  septembre 1815, ministre des affaires étrangères et président du
  conseil. Il se retira en décembre 1818, mais conserva la dignité de
  ministre d'État et reçut celle de grand veneur. Il revint au
  pouvoir en février 1820, mais ne le garda que jusqu'en décembre
  1821. Il mourut l'année suivante.

J'ai l'honneur d'adresser à Votre Majesté les copies des deux pièces
par lesquelles il a, pour me servir de ses expressions, fait la
clôture de sa correspondance avec lord Castlereagh. On l'a
généralement blâmé de s'être engagé, pour ainsi dire, corps à corps
dans une lutte qu'on aurait jugée peu digne de son rang, quand bien
même il y aurait eu de l'avantage, et le contraire est arrivé. Ainsi,
au lieu du triomphe dont il s'était sans doute flatté, son
amour-propre n'en a remporté que des blessures.

Votre Majesté verra par toute cette discussion que lord Castlereagh
n'avait envisagé la question de la Pologne que sous un seul point de
vue, et qu'il l'avait isolée de toute autre question. Non seulement il
n'a pas demandé le rétablissement de la Pologne indépendante, mais il
n'en a pas exprimé le voeu; et même il a parlé du peuple polonais dans
des termes plus propres à dissuader de ce rétablissement qu'à le
provoquer. Il s'est surtout bien gardé de joindre la question
polonaise à celle de la Saxe qu'il avait complètement abandonnée et
qu'il va désormais soutenir.

J'ai aussi l'honneur d'adresser à Votre Majesté une lettre de son
consul à Livourne[429]. J'ai fait usage ici, et avec succès, des
renseignements qu'elle contient et que j'ai fait parvenir à l'empereur
de Russie. M. de Saint-Marsan en a reçu de semblables, et M. de
Metternich a avoué qu'il a reçu de Paris les mêmes avis. La conclusion
que j'en tire est qu'il faut se hâter de se débarrasser de l'homme de
l'île d'Elbe et de Murat. Mon opinion fructifie. Le comte de Munster
la partage avec chaleur. Il en a écrit à sa cour. Il en a parlé à lord
Castlereagh, au point qu'il est allé à son tour exciter M. de
Metternich qui emploie tout moyen pour faire prévaloir l'opinion
contraire.

  [429] Le chevalier Mariotti, qui avait été chargé de surveiller les
  menées de Napoléon à l'île d'Elbe.

Son grand art est de nous faire perdre du temps, croyant par là en
gagner. Il y a déjà huit jours que la commission pour les affaires
d'Italie a réglé celle de Gênes. J'ai déjà eu l'honneur d'annoncer à
Votre Majesté qu'elles avaient été réglées selon ses désirs. Je joins
aujourd'hui à ma lettre au département le travail de la commission.
Votre Majesté y retrouvera les clauses et même les termes prescrits
dans nos instructions. Demain la commission des huit puissances
prendra connaissance du rapport et prononcera[430]. Je ne doute pas
que les conclusions du rapport ne soient adoptées. On s'occupera
ensuite de la Toscane et de Parme. Ce travail, qui devrait être déjà
terminé, a été retardé par la petite maladie de M. de Metternich qui,
pour ne rien finir, appelle son état actuel: convalescence.

  [430] Variante: _sur ce travail_.

Le temps perdu pour les affaires se consume dans des fêtes. L'empereur
Alexandre en demande et même en commande, comme s'il était chez lui.
On nous invite à ces fêtes, on nous y montre des égards, on nous y
traite avec distinction pour marquer les sentiments qu'on porte à
Votre Majesté dont nous entendons partout l'éloge; mais tout cela ne
me fait pas oublier qu'il y après de trois mois que je suis éloigné
d'elle.

J'ai parlé à lord Castlereagh de l'arrestation de lord Oxford, que M.
de Jaucourt m'avait mandée. Loin d'en témoigner du déplaisir, il m'a
dit qu'il en était charmé; et m'a dépeint lord Oxford comme un homme
qui ne méritait aucune sorte d'estime. Je voudrais bien que dans ses
papiers on en eût trouvé de propres à compromettre Murat vis-à-vis de
cette cour-ci.

Les deux courriers que j'ai reçus de Paris m'ont apporté les lettres
dont Votre Majesté m'a honoré, en date du 22 et du 26 novembre.

Je suis...

Nº 11 _ter_.--LE ROI LOUIS XVIII AU PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND.

Paris, ce 10 décembre 1814.

Mon cousin,

J'ai reçu votre numéro 14.

Vous avez fort bien interprété mon intention au sujet du canton
d'Argovie. J'aimerais assurément beaucoup mieux que la Suisse redevînt
ce qu'elle fut jadis; mais je ne veux pas l'impossible, et pourvu que
le canton de Berne soit satisfait autant qu'il peut l'être, vu les
circonstances, je le serai aussi. Quant au prince évêque de Bâle, je
ne m'étais pas rappelé le dernier recès de l'empire; mais je vois
qu'il tranche[431] la question à son égard, et je n'ai plus
d'objection à faire contre les dispositions à faire du Porentruy.

  [431] Variante: _qu'il a tranché_.

J'ai lu avec intérêt et je conserverai avec soin les pièces que vous
m'avez envoyées. Lord Castlereagh parle très bien relativement à la
Pologne; mais sa note du 11 octobre fait grand tort à son langage. Si,
cependant, il réussissait à persuader l'empereur de Russie, ce serait
d'un grand avantage pour la Saxe; mais je n'y vois guère d'apparence,
et il faut continuer à marcher dans notre ligne.

Vous connaissez le prince Czartoryski; je le connais aussi; le choix
que l'empereur Alexandre a fait de lui pour intermédiaire me fait
croire que Sa Majesté impériale voudrait plutôt me rapprocher d'elle
que se rapprocher de moi. Continuez néanmoins ces conférences en
continuant également à suivre mes intentions. Il n'en pourra résulter
aucun mal et peut-être feront-elles quelque bien.

J'aime à croire que c'est par frayeur que Murat fait le fanfaron; ne
perdons cependant jamais de vue que s'il existe une ressource à
Buonaparte, c'est en Italie, par le moyen de Murat; et qu'ainsi:
_delenda est Carthago_.

Sur quoi je prie Dieu, qu'il vous ait, mon cousin, en sa sainte et
digne garde.

Nº 18 _bis_.--LES AMBASSADEURS DU ROI AU CONGRÈS, AU MINISTRE DES
AFFAIRES ÉTRANGÈRES A PARIS.

Vienne, le 14 décembre 1814.

Monsieur le comte,

La dépêche du 5 novembre au département avait exposé l'avantage qui
pouvait résulter de l'échange d'une partie du pays de Gex contre une
partie de l'évêché de Bâle; échange désiré par le corps helvétique,
sollicité par les Genevois et proposé par les puissances.

Ce sacrifice aurait pu faire espérer une plus grande influence sur le
corps helvétique, si on avait pu procurer au canton de Berne, le
retour d'un de ses cantons.

On aurait dû croire aussi que les Genevois reconnaîtraient le prix de
cette condescendance, et travailleraient de leur côté à engager les
Vaudois et les Argoviens à satisfaire aux justes prétentions
pécuniaires que présentait le canton de Berne.

Pressé par le plénipotentiaire anglais de faire connaître à quelles
conditions la France attachait l'échange d'une partie du pays de Gex,
le plénipotentiaire français lui remit la note verbale numéro 1, en le
priant de ne la communiquer qu'aux ministres, pour savoir si leurs
instructions admettaient qu'on s'écartât en faveur de Berne du
principe de l'intégrité des dix-neuf cantons. Le ministre anglais, au
lieu de s'en tenir à cette communication confidentielle, en fit part
aux députés genevois qui dressèrent un contre-projet (nº 2).

Les conditions qu'il renferme sont toutes en opposition aux ordres du
roi qui voulait que l'échange eût lieu sans qu'on prît de territoire
sur le roi de Sardaigne, et que Berne recouvrât la partie de l'Argovie
que ce canton avait possédée.

Dans cet intervalle, on fut instruit que les puissances, et surtout
l'Angleterre, attachaient à cet échange l'espoir qu'il devait
augmenter leur influence en Suisse. Elles faisaient sentir à la ligue
helvétique combien on leur devait de reconnaissance pour l'avoir fait
réussir.

Les Genevois, loin de reconnaître le sacrifice que la France faisait,
avaient la prétention de tout obtenir du congrès, et soutenaient que,
par la protection des alliés, rien ne pouvait leur être refusé. Pour
le prouver ils assuraient que, quoique l'échange fût contraire à
l'opinion en France, le roi, cependant, y acquiesçait.

Ces observations dont on eut connaissance excitèrent l'attention; et
dans les conférences, le plénipotentiaire français eut occasion de
pénétrer que l'Angleterre ne protégeait si ardemment cet échange, que
pour mieux se faire valoir; et pouvoir réaliser des promesses faites
aux Genevois à l'époque du traité de Chaumont.

Plusieurs lettres de Paris, adressées à des députés suisses,
annoncèrent en même temps que l'opinion désapprouvait cet échange, et
qu'on était étonné que le gouvernement français y consentît.

On crut donc plus utile aux intérêts du roi et de la France de
l'écarter, et on insista d'autant plus fortement à le faire que la
situation intérieure de la Suisse et les obstacles qu'opposait
l'empereur de Russie à tout changement des nouveaux cantons rendaient
impossible d'obtenir les conditions auxquelles le roi attachait
l'exécution de l'échange.

Le plénipotentiaire français remit en conséquence une réponse (nº 3)
au projet genevois, et déclara que l'échange ne pouvait plus avoir
lieu. Le plénipotentiaire anglais, en exprimant ses regrets de ce
changement, annonça que son gouvernement allait faire une nouvelle
démarche à Paris pour en obtenir l'exécution, et proposa de réserver
la partie de l'évêché de Bâle qui devait servir d'équivalent, en la
laissant sous une administration provisoire. Les autres
plénipotentiaires s'y refusèrent; mais ils consentirent à ce que cette
réserve durât jusqu'à la fin du congrès, et à ce qu'on appuyât les
démarches proposées par l'Angleterre.

Quoique le plénipotentiaire d'Autriche et celui de France observassent
que cela prolongeait les incertitudes et nuisait aux intérêts réels de
la Suisse, la proposition de l'Angleterre fut maintenue.

Nous croyons donc que lord Wellington recevra l'ordre de provoquer une
nouvelle décision du roi pour savoir si, malgré la reconnaissance de
l'intégrité des dix-neuf cantons, le roi voudrait consentir à cet
échange. Nous pensons qu'il est de l'intérêt du roi de le refuser:

1º Parce qu'il ne donne plus les avantages qu'on en attendait;

2º Que l'influence de la France ne peut s'augmenter en Suisse que par
le canton de Berne et ses alliés;

3º Qu'aussi longtemps que tout ce qui concerne le corps helvétique se
fait sous les auspices des puissances alliées, la France doit réserver
ses moyens, et n'agir que plus tard, pour fortifier son influence.

En vous instruisant ainsi, monsieur le comte, de ce qui s'est passé à
ce sujet, vous serez prévenu de tout lorsque l'ambassadeur anglais se
présentera pour relever cette discussion.

Il pourra encore être utile que l'ambassadeur du roi à Londres
connaisse cette affaire, et nous vous prions, monsieur le comte, de
lui en transmettre les détails, que vous voudrez bien porter à la
connaissance du roi.

M. le prince de Talleyrand, pour écarter plus facilement les
importunités des ministres anglais, leur a dit que le roi avait
demandé au chancelier de France sous quelle forme les cessions ou
échanges de territoire pouvaient se faire, et que M. le chancelier
avait répondu que cela n'était point assez déterminé et qu'il fallait
éviter de s'engager dans des questions semblables. D'après quoi, les
plénipotentiaires français ne pouvaient point donner de suite à cette
question.

Il sera bon, monsieur le comte, d'en prévenir M. le chancelier pour
qu'il évite une explication à ce sujet, dans le cas où l'ambassadeur
d'Angleterre lui en parlerait, ou qu'il fasse une réponse analogue à
celle que nous avons faite ici.

Nº 19 _bis_.--LES AMBASSADEURS DU ROI AU CONGRÈS, AU MINISTRE DES
AFFAIRES ÉTRANGÈRES A PARIS.

Vienne, le 14 décembre 1814.

Monsieur le comte,

Nous avons l'honneur de vous adresser le protocole de la dernière
conférence. Une plus récente a eu lieu, mais le protocole n'en est
point encore expédié. On s'est réservé de décider, à l'égard de la
proposition de M. de Labrador sur les fiefs impériaux, à l'époque où
le sort du roi d'Étrurie, celui de l'archiduchesse Marie-Louise...
seront fixés; le plénipotentiaire français a proposé, suivant le
principe d'une exécution fidèle des dispositions du traité de Paris la
formation de trois nouvelles commissions:

La première pour régler, conformément à l'article V, la navigation des
fleuves;

La seconde, pour régler le rang et la préséance des couronnes, et tout
ce qui en était une conséquence;

La troisième, pour discuter l'abolition de la traite des nègres.

Cette dernière a éprouvé quelques difficultés parce que le
plénipotentiaire portugais a observé que la commission ne pouvait être
formée que par les puissances intéressées. M. de Labrador a fortement
appuyé l'opposition du Portugal. La discussion a été si positive que
cette commission a été ajournée, et que cet objet sera replacé dans la
voie de simples négociations.

Nous observons encore que le Portugal a établi pour principe qu'il ne
renoncerait à la traite des nègres qu'après l'époque de huit années,
et si l'Angleterre voulait regarder le traité de commerce qui existe
entre elle et le Portugal comme non avenu.

La proposition faite par la France était conforme à l'engagement pris
avec l'Angleterre d'interposer ses bons offices pour faire prononcer
par toutes les puissances l'abolition de la traite; nous n'aurons donc
plus maintenant à nous en occuper.

Les deux autres commissions ont été formées.

M. le prince de Talleyrand a nommé à celle de la navigation M. le duc
de Dalberg, et à celle chargée de fixer les préséances et le rang
entre les couronnes M. le comte de la Tour du Pin, en qualité de
commissaires.

La Russie a demandé de nommer un délégué à la commission d'Italie et a
désigné M. le comte de Nesselrode. Il n'y a eu aucune difficulté à ce
sujet.

L'affaire de Pologne et de Saxe a été avancée, sans donner encore un
résultat positif. Tout, cependant, est amélioré à l'égard de la Saxe.
L'Autriche est décidée à la soutenir; l'Angleterre a changé de
langage; toutes les intrigues prussiennes et russes ont été dévoilées.
Les explications qui ont eu lieu ont toutes conduit à prouver que la
Prusse peut obtenir son rétablissement sur la base de population
qu'elle avait en 1805, sans enlever à la Saxe plus de trois à quatre
cent mille âmes.

Nous sommes parvenus à cet égard à ce que nous voulions, et le roi et
sa politique ont obtenu les premiers avantages. Il est possible que la
Prusse, secondée par la Russie, veuille ne pas céder; mais, dans ce
cas, les forces seraient très inégales, et la Prusse risquerait tout.
Nous espérons avec quelque fondement qu'elle jugera sa position et
qu'elle cédera.

L'Autriche paraît toujours décidée à ne point laisser éloigner Murat.
On a donc voulu s'assurer plus positivement de l'Angleterre, la
Russie paraissant assez bien disposée à cet égard. Lord Castlereagh va
demander de nouvelles instructions à sa cour. Il a communiqué à M. le
prince de Talleyrand toute la correspondance qui avait rapport aux
affaires de Naples, et a eu l'air de désirer, plutôt pour appuyer ce
qu'il écrit, qu'on recherchât dans nos cartons tout ce qui peut
prouver aux coalisés que Murat avait eu une double intrigue avec
Bonaparte. Nous ne doutons pas que plusieurs lettres de lui, et des
dépêches qui ont été conservées, ne le prouvent. Vous voudrez bien,
monsieur le comte, nous les transmettre en original.

Le prince Eugène a dit posséder à cet égard des preuves matérielles,
mais il s'est refusé à les donner.

M. le prince de Talleyrand présente dans sa correspondance plus de
détails sur la position générale, mais nous pouvons le dire avec
confiance: le roi et la France ont obtenu au congrès l'attitude qui
leur appartient, et la considération qui leur est donnée laisse les
moyens d'exercer le degré d'influence qui est honorable pour le roi et
qui assure une entière garantie à l'Europe.

Nº 16.--LE PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND AU ROI LOUIS XVIII.

Vienne, le 15 décembre 1814.

SIRE,

La note par laquelle les princes allemands du second et du troisième
ordre devaient manifester leur voeu pour la conservation de la Saxe
était sur le point d'être signée; elle ne l'a point été et ne le sera
pas.

Le duc de Cobourg[432] était à la tête de ces princes. Sa conduite ne
saurait être trop louée.

  [432] Ernest-Antoine de Saxe-Cobourg-Saafeld, né en 1784. Il servit
  d'abord dans l'armée russe. Après la paix de Tilsitt, il revint
  dans ses États qu'il conserva dans leur intégrité. Le congrès de
  Vienne lui donna la principauté de Lichtenberg, mais il la vendit à
  la Prusse en 1834. Il promulgua une constitution en 1821, et mourut
  en 1844.

L'une de ses soeurs[433] est mariée au grand-duc Constantin. Son frère
puîné est aide de camp du grand-duc et général-major au service de
Russie[434]. Lui-même, il a porté dans la dernière campagne l'uniforme
russe. Fort avant dans les bonnes grâces de l'empereur Alexandre, il
est lié intimement avec le roi de Prusse. Leur ressentiment pouvait
lui paraître à craindre s'il contrariait leurs desseins, et, d'un
autre côté, il avait toute raison d'espérer que, si la Saxe venait à
être sacrifiée, il pourrait en obtenir quelques lambeaux. Tous ces
motifs n'ont pu faire taire en lui la voix de la reconnaissance et
celle de la justice, ni lui faire oublier ce qu'il devait à sa maison
et à son pays. Lorsqu'en 1807, après la mort du duc son père, ses
possessions furent séquestrées, parce qu'il était dans le camp des
Russes, et que Bonaparte voulait le proscrire, il fut protégé par
l'intercession du roi de Saxe. Depuis, le roi avait été le maître
d'étendre sa souveraineté sur tous les duchés de Saxe, et il l'avait
refusé. A son tour, le duc s'est montré zélé défenseur de la cause du
roi. Il l'avait fait plaider à Londres par le duc Léopold, son frère,
qui avait trouvé le prince régent dans les dispositions les plus
favorables. Il l'a plaidée ici auprès des souverains et de leurs
ministres. Il est allé jusqu'à remettre, en son nom, à lord
Castlereagh, un mémoire où il combattait ses raisonnements et qu'il
avait concerté avec nous.

Informé par le duc de Weimar[435] de la note qui se préparait,
l'empereur Alexandre a fait appeler le duc de Cobourg et l'a accablé
de reproches, tant pour le mémoire qu'il avait remis à lord
Castlereagh, que pour ses démarches récentes, l'accusant d'intrigues,
lui citant la conduite du duc de Weimar comme un modèle qu'il aurait
dû suivre, lui disant que s'il avait des représentations à faire,
c'était au prince de Hardenberg qu'il aurait dû les adresser, et lui
déclarant qu'il n'obtiendrait rien de ce qui lui avait été promis.

  [433] Julie-Henriette-Ulrique, princesse de Saxe-Cobourg, née en
  1781. Elle épousa, en 1796, le grand-duc Constantin, frère de
  l'empereur Alexandre, qui la répudia en 1810.

  [434] Ferdinand-Charles-Auguste, duc de Saxe-Cobourg, né en 1785,
  marié à la princesse de Kohary. Il en eut trois fils dont l'un
  épousa dona Maria II, reine de Portugal, et un autre la princesse
  Clémentine, fille du roi Louis-Philippe. Sa fille Victoria épousa,
  en 1840, le duc de Nemours. Le duc Ferdinand mourut en 1851.

  [435] Charles-Auguste, duc, puis grand-duc de Saxe-Weimar, né en
  1757, perdit son père à l'âge de huit mois, et fut proclamé duc
  sous la régence de sa mère Amélie de Brunswick, âgée alors
  seulement de dix-huit ans. Il prit du service dans l'armée
  prussienne et reçut un commandement important dans la campagne de
  1806. Après la bataille d'Iéna, il entra dans la confédération du
  Rhin. En 1814, il se rendit au congrès de Vienne. C'est alors que
  le titre de grand-duc lui fut conféré. Il mourut en 1828. Son fils
  aîné, Charles-Frédéric, qui lui succéda, avait épousé la soeur de
  l'empereur Alexandre, la grande-duchesse Marie Paulowna.

Le duc a été noble et ferme. Il a parlé de ses droits comme prince de
la maison de Saxe; de ses devoirs comme prince allemand, et, comme
homme d'honneur, il ne se croyait pas libre de ne point les remplir.
Si le duc de Weimar en jugeait autrement, il ne pouvait que le
plaindre. Du reste, il avait, dit-il, compromis deux fois son
existence par attachement pour Sa Majesté Impériale. S'il fallait
aujourd'hui la sacrifier pour l'honneur, il était prêt.

De leur côté[436], les Prussiens, leurs émissaires, et,
particulièrement, le prince royal de Wurtemberg, ont intimidé une
partie des ministres allemands, en déclarant qu'ils tiendraient pour
ennemis tous ceux qui signeraient quelque chose en faveur de la Saxe.

  [436] Variante: _d'un autre côté_.

Voilà pourquoi la note n'a point été signée. Mais on sait qu'elle a dû
l'être, et ce qui a empêché qu'elle ne le fût. Le voeu qu'elle devait
exprimer a peut-être acquis plus de force par la violence employée
pour l'étouffer.

Si je me suis étendu sur cette circonstance particulière plus qu'il ne
l'aurait fallu peut-être, je l'ai fait par le double motif de rendre
au duc de Cobourg la justice que je crois lui être due, et de faire
mieux connaître à Votre Majesté le genre et la diversité des obstacles
contre lesquels nous avons à lutter.

Pendant que ces choses se passaient, les Prussiens recevaient de M. de
Metternich une note où il leur déclarait que le royaume de Saxe devait
être conservé, en établissant par des calculs statistiques joints à sa
note, que leur population sera la même qu'en 1805, si, à celle des
pays qu'ils ont conservés et à celle des pays disponibles qui leur
sont destinés, on ajoute seulement trois cent trente mille Saxons.

Je me hâte de dire à Votre Majesté que le comte de Munster a déclaré
qu'il renonçait aux agrandissements promis pour le Hanovre, si cela
était nécessaire pour que la Saxe fût conservée. Votre Majesté
l'apprendra sûrement avec plaisir, et à cause des affaires que cela
facilite, et à cause de l'estime dont elle honore le comte de Munster.

Un passage de la note de M. de Metternich, dans lequel il s'étayait de
l'opposition de la France aux vues de la Prusse sur la Saxe, ayant
probablement fait craindre à l'empereur Alexandre qu'il n'y eût un
concert déjà formé ou prêt à se former entre l'Autriche et nous, il
m'envoya sur-le-champ le prince Adam Czartoryski.

A son début, le prince m'a renouvelé la proposition que l'empereur
Alexandre m'avait faite lui-même, dans le dernier entretien que j'ai
eu l'honneur d'avoir avec lui, de nous prêter à ses désirs dans la
question de la Saxe, nous promettant tout son appui dans celle de
Naples. Sa proposition lui paraissait d'autant plus acceptable que,
maintenant, il ne demandait plus l'abandon de la Saxe entière, et
qu'il consentait à ce qu'il restât _un noyau_ du royaume de Saxe.

Je répondis que quant à la question de Naples, je m'en tenais à ce que
l'empereur m'avait dit, que je me fiais à sa parole, que d'ailleurs
ses intérêts dans cette question étaient les mêmes que les nôtres, et
qu'il n'y pourrait pas être d'un autre avis que nous; que si la
question de Pologne, que l'on devait regarder comme personnelle à
l'empereur Alexandre, puisqu'il y attachait sa satisfaction et sa
gloire, avait été décidée selon ses désirs (elle ne l'est pas encore
complètement, mais peu s'en faut), il le devait à la persuasion où
étaient l'Autriche et la Prusse que nous ne serions à cet égard qu'en
seconde ligne; que dans la question de la Saxe, réellement étrangère
aux intérêts de l'empereur, nous avions pris sur nous d'engager le roi
de Saxe à quelques sacrifices, mais que l'esprit de conciliation ne
pouvait pas porter à aller aussi loin que l'empereur paraissait le
désirer.

Le prince me parla d'alliance et de mariage. Je lui dis que tant
d'objets si graves ne pouvaient se traiter à la fois; qu'il y avait
d'ailleurs des choses qu'on ne pouvait mêler à d'autres, parce que ce
serait leur donner le caractère avilissant d'un marché.

Il me demanda si nous avions des engagements avec l'Autriche: je lui
dis que non; si nous en prendrions avec elle, dans le cas où l'on ne
s'entendrait pas sur la Saxe, à quoi je répondis: _J'en serais fâché._
Après un moment de silence, nous nous quittâmes poliment, mais
froidement.

L'empereur, qui devait aller le soir à une fête que donnait M. de
Metternich, n'y vint point. Un mal de tête subit en fut la cause ou le
prétexte. Il y envoya l'impératrice et les grandes-duchesses.

Il fit engager[437] M. de Metternich à se rendre chez lui le lendemain
matin.

  [437] Variante: _Le lendemain matin_, il fit engager.

Pendant le bal, M. de Metternich s'approcha de moi, et, après m'avoir
remercié d'un petit service que je lui avais rendu, il se plaignit à
moi de l'embarras dans lequel les notes de lord Castlereagh sur la
Saxe le mettaient. Je pensais qu'il n'y en avait eu qu'une de très
compromettante (celle du 11 octobre); mais il me parla d'une autre que
j'ai pu me procurer aujourd'hui, et dont j'ai l'honneur d'envoyer une
copie à Votre Majesté. Quoiqu'elle porte le titre de Note verbale de
lord Castlereagh, je sais qu'elle est l'ouvrage de M. Cook, auquel, et
comme doctrine et comme style, elle ne fera pas beaucoup d'honneur.
Elle a été remise aux trois puissances qui se sont si longtemps
appelées alliées.

M. de Metternich me promit qu'en sortant de chez l'empereur Alexandre,
il viendrait chez moi, s'il n'était pas trop tard, pour me dire ce qui
se serait passé. Cette fois il tint sa parole.

L'empereur fut froid, sec et sévère. Il prétendit que M. de Metternich
lui disait, au nom des Prussiens, des choses qu'ils désavouaient, et
que, de leur côté, les Prussiens lui disaient, de la part de M. de
Metternich, des choses tout opposées à celles qu'il mettait dans ses
notes, de sorte qu'il ne savait ce qu'il devait croire. Il reprocha à
M. de Metternich d'avoir inspiré je ne sais quelles idées au prince de
Hardenberg. M. de Metternich avait et produisit un billet[438] qui
prouvait le contraire. L'empereur prit occasion de ce billet pour
reprocher à M. de Metternich d'en écrire de peu convenables. Ce
reproche avait quelque fondement. L'empereur avait dans les mains des
communications toutes particulières et toutes confidentielles qu'il ne
pouvait tenir que d'une indiscrétion fort coupable de la part des
Prussiens. L'empereur, ensuite, parut vouloir douter que la note de M.
de Metternich contînt l'expression des véritables sentiments de
l'empereur d'Autriche, et ajouta qu'il voulait s'en expliquer avec
l'empereur lui-même. M. de Metternich fit[439] immédiatement prévenir
son maître, qui, si l'empereur Alexandre fait quelques questions sur
ce sujet, répondra que la note a été faite par son ordre, et ne
contient rien qu'il n'avoue.

  [438] Variante: _de M. de Hardenberg_.

  [439] Variante: _alla_.

Dans une conférence entre M. de Metternich et M. de Hardenberg, les
difficultés n'ont porté que sur les calculs statistiques qui étaient
joints à la note de M. de Metternich. Ils se séparèrent sans être
convenus de rien, sur la proposition faite par M. de Metternich de
nommer une commission pour les vérifier.

Voilà, Sire, présentement l'état des choses.

L'Autriche ne fait entrer la Saxe dans ses calculs que pour une perte
de quatre cent mille âmes. Elle ne veut[440] point abandonner la haute
Lusace, à cause des défilés de Gabel, qui ouvrent l'entrée de la
Bohême. C'est par là que les Français y pénétrèrent en 1813.

  [440] Variante: _voudrait_.

L'empereur de Russie consent à laisser subsister un royaume de Saxe,
lequel, selon le prince Adam Czartoryski, ne devrait être que la
moitié de ce qu'il est aujourd'hui.

Enfin, la Prusse semble aujourd'hui réduire ses prétentions à des
calculs de population, et conséquemment les subordonner aux résultats
et à la vérification de ces calculs.

Sans doute, la question n'est pas encore décidée, mais les chances
sont maintenant plus favorables qu'elles ne l'ont jamais été.

M. de Metternich m'a proposé de me faire lire sa note. Je l'ai
remercié en lui disant que je la connaissais, mais que je désirais
qu'il me la communiquât officiellement; qu'il me semblait qu'il le
devait, puisqu'il nous y avait cités, ce que je pourrais lui reprocher
d'avoir fait sans nous en avoir prévenus; qu'il fallait que nous
pussions la soutenir, et que nous ne le pouvions convenablement que
sur une communication régulière. Il m'a donné sa parole de faire ce
que je désirais. Mon motif particulier, pour tenir à une participation
formelle, est que ce sera là la véritable date de la rupture de la
coalition.

Je proposai, il y a quelques jours, la formation d'une commission pour
s'occuper de l'affaire de la traite des nègres. Cette proposition
allait être faite, et je voulus m'en emparer pour faire une chose
agréable à lord Castlereagh, et le disposer par là à se rapprocher de
nous dans les questions difficiles d'Italie, que nous commençons à
aborder. J'ai obtenu quelque chose, car, de lui-même, il m'a demandé
de lui indiquer de quelle manière je proposerais de régler l'affaire
de Naples, me promettant d'envoyer un courrier pour demander les
ordres dont il pourrait avoir besoin. Je lui ai écrit la lettre
ci-jointe. Après l'avoir reçue, il m'a proposé de me montrer sa
correspondance avec lord Bentinck. Je l'ai lue, et il est certain que
les Anglais sont parfaitement libres dans cette question. Mais on a
fait à Murat de certaines promesses que l'on pourrait être, comme
homme, embarrassé de ne pas tenir, s'il avait lui-même tenu fidèlement
toutes les siennes. «Je crois savoir, m'a dit lord Castlereagh[441],
que Murat a entretenu des correspondances avec Bonaparte, dans les
mois de décembre 1813, de janvier et de février 1814; mais je serais
bien aise d'en avoir la preuve. Cela faciliterait singulièrement ma
marche. Si vous aviez dans vos archives de telles preuves, vous me
feriez plaisir de me les procurer.» J'écris aujourd'hui dans ma lettre
au département de faire faire des recherches pour trouver celles qui
pourraient exister aux affaires étrangères. Il serait possible qu'il
y eût quelques traces d'intelligence entre Murat et Bonaparte à la
secrétairerie d'État[442].

  [441] Variante: _m'a-t-il dit_.

  [442] Variante: _Du reste, lord Castlereagh n'a fait aucune
  objection à la forme que je lui ai proposé de suivre._

M. le comte de Jaucourt mettra sûrement, sous les yeux de Votre
Majesté, les deux lettres que j'adresse aujourd'hui au département. Je
supplie Votre Majesté de vouloir bien se refuser aux propositions qui
lui seraient[443] faites à Paris relativement au pays de Gex. On ne
tient aucune des conditions auxquelles Votre Majesté avait subordonné
l'échange proposé. Nous avons d'ailleurs beaucoup de raisons d'être
mécontents des Genevois qui se trouvent ici. L'autorité de M. le
chancelier est plus que suffisante pour motiver l'abandon de cette
question qui a été conduite avec un peu de précipitation.

Nº 12 _ter_.--LE ROI LOUIS XVIII AU PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND.

Paris, ce 18 décembre 1814.

Mon cousin,

J'ai reçu votre numéro 15 qui m'a causé une vive satisfaction. Si
l'Angleterre se déclare franchement en faveur de la Saxe, sa réunion
avec l'Autriche et la plus grande partie de l'Allemagne doit triompher
_des lumières du siècle_. J'aime la fermeté de l'empereur François, et
la défection du roi de Wurtemberg me touche peu. J'attends
l'explication que vous me dites au sujet de ce prince, mais, d'après
ce que je connais de lui, je ne serais tenté de conseiller à personne
de s'y allier de bien près.

Les lettres trouvées dans la portefeuille de lord Oxford n'ont produit
aucune lumière sur les menées de Murat, mais les faits contenus dans
la lettre de Livourne, et de la vérité desquels on ne peut douter,
puisque le prince de Metternich avoue en avoir connaissance, parlent
d'eux-mêmes, et il est temps[444] que toutes les puissances
s'entendent pour arracher la dernière racine du mal. A ce sujet, M. de
Jaucourt vous a sûrement instruit du reproche injuste, et j'ose dire
ingrat, qui a été fait au comte Hector d'Agoult. Il serait bon que
vous en parlassiez à M. de Labrador, afin que son témoignage servît à
éclairer M. de Cevallos[445], s'il est dans l'erreur, ou du moins à le
confondre, si, comme je le soupçonne très violemment, il se ment à
lui-même.

  [444] Variante: et _il est plus que temps_.

  [445] Ministre des affaires étrangères d'Espagne.

Je regarde comme d'un bon augure le désir que l'empereur de Russie
témoigne de vous revoir. Je n'ai rien à ajouter à ce que je vous ai
dit sur les grandes affaires; mais il en est une que, d'une manière ou
d'autre, je voudrais voir terminer, c'est celle du mariage. J'ai donné
mon _ultimatum_. Je ne regarderai point à ce qui pourra se passer en
pays étrangers, mais la duchesse de Berry, quelle qu'elle puisse être,
ne franchira les frontières de la France que faisant profession
ouverte de la religion catholique, apostolique, romaine. A ce prix, je
suis non seulement prêt, mais empressé de conclure. Si, au contraire,
ces conditions ne conviennent pas à l'empereur de Russie, qu'il
veuille bien le dire: nous n'en resterons pas moins bons amis, et je
traiterai un autre mariage.

Je ne m'aperçois pas moins que vous de votre absence, mais dans des
affaires aussi importantes, il faut s'appliquer à ce que Lucain dit de
César[446]. Sur quoi je prie Dieu qu'il vous ait, mon cousin, en sa
sainte et digne garde.

LOUIS.

  [446] Variante: il faut s'appliquer _ce que Lucain_.

Nº 20 _bis_.--LES AMBASSADEURS DU ROI AU CONGRÈS, AU MINISTRE DES
AFFAIRES ÉTRANGÈRES A PARIS.

Vienne, le 20 décembre 1814.

Monsieur le comte,

Les questions sur la Pologne et la Saxe ne sont point encore résolues.
M. le prince de Talleyrand rend compte au roi de la communication que
le prince de Metternich lui a faite de la note que ce dernier a
adressée aux Prussiens et par laquelle il déclare: «Que le cabinet de
Vienne réprouve l'incorporation de la Saxe à la Prusse.»

M. le prince de Talleyrand a répondu par une note qui expose avec
force les principes qui doivent être suivis dans l'arrangement des
affaires de l'Europe. On attend que les Prussiens fassent connaître
leur décision. On assurait qu'ils avaient rédigé une note très forte
dans laquelle ils posent en principe que l'incorporation de la Saxe à
leur monarchie n'admettait plus de contradiction. On nous a dit que
l'empereur de Russie lui-même n'avait pas voulu que cette note fût
remise.

Lord Castlereagh ne peut cacher son embarras, mais ne s'explique
encore sur rien. L'embarras de sa position tient à ce qu'il a, dans
plusieurs circonstances, abandonné la Saxe, même par écrit; et de
plus, lorsqu'il a défendu dans les mêmes notes la Pologne, il n'a
point parlé de la Pologne _grande et indépendante_, mais seulement de
la Pologne.

Les affaires d'Italie, celle de Naples exceptée, sur laquelle rien n'a
été dit, avancent et se traitent dans un bon sens. Rien cependant
n'est encore terminé.

Les conférences sur les affaires de la Suisse ont fait des progrès et
on rédige le rapport qui doit être soumis au comité des huit
puissances. Nous aurons l'honneur de le transmettre au département dès
qu'il aura été présenté.

Nº 17.--LE PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND AU ROI LOUIS XVIII.

Vienne, le 20 décembre 1814.

SIRE,

J'ai reçu la lettre dont Votre Majesté a daigné m'honorer, en date du
10 décembre et sous le numéro 11.

J'ai l'honneur de lui envoyer les copies de la note de M. de
Metternich à M. de Hardenberg, au sujet de la Saxe, des tableaux qui y
étaient joints[447] et de la lettre officielle que M. de Metternich
m'a écrite en me communiquant ces pièces. Il avait accompagné le tout
d'un billet de sa main, où il me répétait, mais moins explicitement,
ce qu'il m'avait déjà dit de vive voix, que cette note serait la
dernière pièce de la coalition, en ajoutant qu'il se félicitait de se
trouver sur la même ligne que le cabinet de Votre Majesté pour la
défense d'une aussi belle cause.

  [447] Variante: _annexés_.

Je désirais ardemment cette communication pour la raison que j'ai eu
l'honneur de dire à Votre Majesté dans ma précédente lettre. Je la
désirais encore comme devant m'offrir une occasion toute naturelle de
faire une profession de foi qui fît connaître les principes, les vues
et les déterminations de Votre Majesté. Je cherchais depuis longtemps
cette occasion: j'avais essayé de diverses manières de la faire
naître, et dès qu'elle s'est offerte, je me suis hâté d'en profiter,
en adressant à M. de Metternich la réponse dont j'ai l'honneur de
joindre ici une copie.

J'ai montré ce que la question de Pologne eût été pour nous, si on
l'eût voulu; pourquoi elle a perdu de son intérêt, et j'ai ajouté que
la faute n'en était pas à nous.

En traitant la question de la Saxe, j'ai réfuté les arguments
révolutionnaires des Prussiens et de M. Cook dans son _Saxon-point_ et
je crois avoir prouvé ce que jusqu'ici lord Castlereagh n'a pas pu ou
voulu comprendre, que, sous le rapport de l'équilibre, la question de
la Saxe était plus importante que celle de la Pologne, dans les termes
où celle-ci s'est trouvée réduite. Il est évident que l'Allemagne,
après avoir perdu son équilibre propre, ne pourrait plus servir à
l'équilibre général, et que son équilibre serait détruit si la Saxe
était sacrifiée.

En cherchant à convaincre, je me suis attaché à ne pas blesser. J'ai
rejeté les opinions que j'ai combattues sur une sorte de fatalité, et
j'ai loué les monarques qui les soutiennent pour les porter à les
abandonner.

Quant à Votre Majesté, je ne lui ai pas donné d'éloges. J'ai exposé
les ordres qu'elle nous a donnés; qu'aurais-je pu dire de plus? les
faits parlent.

On assure que, de leur côté, les Prussiens avaient préparé une note,
en réponse à celle de M. de Metternich, et qu'elle était violente;
mais que l'empereur de Russie, à qui elle a été montrée, n'a pas voulu
qu'elle fût envoyée.

Lord Castlereagh est comme un voyageur qui a perdu sa route et ne peut
la retrouver. Honteux d'avoir rapetissé la question polonaise et
d'avoir épuisé vainement tous ses efforts sur cette question, d'avoir
été dupe de la Prusse, quoique nous l'eussions averti, et de lui avoir
abandonné la Saxe, il ne sait plus quel parti prendre. Inquiet
d'ailleurs de l'état de l'opinion en Angleterre, il se propose,
dit-on, d'y retourner pour la rentrée du parlement et de laisser ici
lord Clancarty, pour continuer les négociations.

Les affaires d'Italie marchent dans un assez bon sens. Je suis fondé à
espérer que la reine d'Étrurie aura, pour Parme, l'avantage sur
l'archiduchesse Marie-Louise, et je tâche de disposer les choses de
manière à ce que ces arrangements se fassent sans toucher aux
légations.

La commission des préséances, pour laquelle j'ai nommé M. de la Tour
du Pin, à qui j'ai donné des instructions conformes à celles qu'avait
arrêtées Votre Majesté à ce sujet, sera probablement en état de faire
son rapport, d'ici à dix ou douze jours.

Votre Majesté trouvera peut-être un peu longue la lettre que j'ai
adressée à M. de Metternich, mais je n'ai pas pu la faire plus courte.
Elle est calculée comme pouvant être un jour publiée et lue en
Angleterre comme en France. Tous les mots que j'emploie ont un but
particulier, que Votre Majesté retrouvera dans ma volumineuse
correspondance.

Je suis...

Nº 13 _ter_.--LE ROI LOUIS XVIII AU PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND.

Paris, ce 23 décembre 1814.

Mon cousin,

J'ai reçu votre numéro 16. J'y ai vu avec grande satisfaction la
conduite noble et ferme du duc de Saxe-Cobourg et du comte de Munster.
Vous savez le cas que je fais de ce dernier, et le duc, outre les
liens de parenté entre nous, est frère d'une princesse que j'aime
beaucoup, la duchesse Alexandre de Wurtemberg[448]. Mais cette
satisfaction ne m'empêche pas de regretter que la note ne soit pas
signée: _Verba volant, scripta autem manent._ Je suis content de votre
entretien avec le prince Adam Czartoryski; vous aurez vu dans mon
dernier numéro que je désire une réponse définitive sur l'affaire du
mariage; mais que je suis loin de vouloir lui imprimer le caractère
d'un marché.

  [448] Antoinette-Ernestine-Amélie de Saxe-Cobourg-Saafeld, née en
  1779 épousa, en 1798, Charles-Alexandre-Frédéric, duc de Wurtemberg
  (1771-1833), général au service de la Russie, gouverneur de Livonie
  et de Courlande. Elle eut plusieurs enfants, parmi lesquels un
  fils, Frédéric-Guillaume-Alexandre, né en 1804, qui épousa la
  princesse Marie d'Orléans, fille du roi Louis-Philippe.

L'affaire de la traite me paraît en bonne position. Quant à celle de
Naples qui me touche de bien plus près, il courait dans Vienne, au
départ du duc de Richelieu, un bruit infiniment fâcheux, bruit
confirmé par des lettres particulières, mais auquel votre silence à
cet égard m'empêche d'ajouter foi: celui que l'Autriche s'était
hautement déclarée en faveur de Murat, et cherchait à entraîner
l'Angleterre dans le même parti. Le succès de votre lettre à lord
Castlereagh, celui des démarches que j'ai ordonnées en conséquence, ne
tarderont pas à m'éclairer sur ce que je dois espérer ou craindre.
Rien n'est mieux que ce que vous proposez dans cette lettre, mais je
ne suis pas sans inquiétude sur certaines promesses faites à Murat.
Dussions-nous, ce dont je ne suis pas sûr, car Bonaparte a, dans ses
derniers moments, fait anéantir bien des choses, dussions-nous trouver
les preuves les plus évidentes, il n'est que trop connu qu'une
politique astucieuse sait tirer de tout les inductions qu'elle juge à
propos. Quoi qu'il en soit, poursuivons notre marche; jamais on ne m'y
verra faire un seul pas en arrière.

C'était pour l'avantage du canton de Berne que j'avais consenti à
l'échange d'une partie[449] du pays de Gex; mais, puisqu'on ne veut
pas des conditions que j'y avais mises, je refuserai toute espèce de
consentement, et je ne l'accorderai pas davantage à un arrangement qui
enlèverait quelque chose de plus au roi, mon beau-frère[450]. Sur quoi
je prie Dieu qu'il vous ait, mon cousin, en sa sainte et digne garde.

LOUIS.
