individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you
from copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating
derivative works based on the work as long as all references to Project
Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope that you will support the
Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ mission of promoting free access to electronic works
by freely sharing Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ works in compliance with the terms
of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ name associated

copyright status of any work in any country outside the United States.

*1.F.*

*1.F.1.* Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ collection.
Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ electronic works, and the
medium on which they may be stored, may contain ‚ÄúDefects,‚Äù such as, but
not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription
errors, a copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a
defective or damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢


Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢‚Äôs goals
and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ collection will remain freely
available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and
permanent future for Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ and future generations. To learn
more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how
your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the
Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org .


Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation


The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state
of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue
Service. The Foundation‚Äôs EIN or federal tax identification number is
64-6221541. Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf . Contributions to the
Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation


Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of
equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with
the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside
the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,
please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ electronic
works.


Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless
a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks
in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook‚Äôs eBook
number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.
_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

    http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢, including
how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to
our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

Vorbemerkung


Josefine Mutzenbacher -- ihr Name lautete in Wirklichkeit ein wenig
anders -- wurde zu Wien, in der Vorstadt Hernals am 20. Februar 1852
geboren. Sie stand fr√ºhzeitig unter sittenpolizeilicher Kontrolle, und
√ºbte ihr Gewerbe zuerst in wohlfeilen Freudenh√§usern, der √§u√üeren
Bezirke, dann im Dienste einer Kupplerin, die w√§hrend des
wirtschaftlichen Aufschwungs- und Ausstellungsjahres 1873 die vornehmere
Lebewelt mit M√§dchenware versorgte.

Josefine verschwand damals mit einem Russen aus Wien, kehrte nach
wenigen Jahren wohlhabend und gl√§nzend ausgestattet in ihre Vaterstadt
zur√ºck, wo sie als Dirne der elegantesten Sorte noch bis zum Jahre 1894
ein auffallendes und vielbemerktes Dasein f√ºhrte.

Sie bezog dann in der N√§he von Klagenfurt ein kleines Gut, und
verbrachte ihre Tage in ziemlicher Einsamkeit, zu der sich dann bald
auch ihre Erkrankung gesellte. W√§hrend dieser Krankheit, einem
Frauenleiden, dem Josefine sp√§ter auch erlag, schrieb sie die Geschichte
ihrer Jugend.

Das Manuskript √ºbergab sie, etliche Wochen vor der schweren Operation,
an deren Folge sie starb, ihrem Arzt. Es erscheint hier als ein seltenes
Dokument seelischer Aufrichtigkeit, als ein wertvolles und sonderbares
Bekenntnis, das auch kulturgeschichtlich f√ºr das Liebesleben der
Gegenwart Interesse verdient. An den Bekenntnissen der Josefine
Mutzenbacher wurde im Wesentlichen nicht viel ge√§ndert. Nur sprachliche
Unrichtigkeiten, stilistische Fehler wurden verbessert, und die Namen
bekannter Pers√∂nlichkeiten, die Josefine in ihren √Ñu√üerungen meint,
durch andere ersetzt.

Sie starb den 17. Dezember 1904 in einem Sanatorium.

ERSTES KAPITEL


Man sagt, da√ü aus jungen Huren alte Betschwestern werden. Aber das
trifft bei mir nicht zu. Ich bin fr√ºhzeitig zur Hure geworden, ich habe
alles erlebt, was ein Weib im Bett, auf Tischen, St√ºhlen, B√§nken, an
kahle Mauerecken gelehnt, im Grase liegend, im Winkel dunkler Haustore,
in chambres s√©par√©es, im Eisenbahnzug, in der Kaserne, im Bordell und im
Gef√§ngnis √ºberhaupt nur erleben kann, aber ich bereue nichts von
alledem. Ich bin heute bei Jahren, die Gen√ºsse, die mein Geschlecht mir
bieten kann, sind im Entschwinden begriffen, ich bin reich, bin
verbl√ºht, und sehr oft ganz vereinsamt. Aber es f√§llt mir nicht ein,
obgleich ich immer fromm und gl√§ubig gewesen bin, jetzt Bu√üe zu tun. Aus
Armut und Elend wie ich entstammt bin, habe ich alles meinem K√∂rper zu
verdanken. Ohne diesen gierigen, zu jeder Sinnenlust fr√ºhzeitig
entz√ºndeten, in jedem Laster von Kindheit auf ge√ºbten K√∂rper, w√§re ich
verkommen, wie meine Gespielinnen, die im Findelhaus starben oder als
abgerackerte, stumpfsinnige Proletarierfrauen zugrunde gingen. Ich bin
nicht im Dreck der Vororte erstickt. Ich habe mir eine sch√∂ne Bildung
erworben, die ich nur einzig und allein der Hurerei verdanke, denn diese
war es, die mich in Verkehr mit vornehmen und gelehrten M√§nnern brachte.
Ich habe mich aufkl√§ren lassen und gefunden, da√ü wir armen, niedrig
geborenen Weiber nicht so viel Schuld haben, als man uns einreden
m√∂chte. Ich habe die Welt gesehen und meinen Gesichtskreis erweitert,
und alles das verdanke ich meinem Lebenswandel, den man einen
¬ªlasterhaften¬´ nennt. Wenn ich meine Schicksale jetzt aufschreibe, so
tue ich das nur, die Stunden meiner Einsamkeit damit zu k√ºrzen, und was
mir jetzt abgeht, aus der Erinnerung wenigstens herbeizuschaffen. Ich
halte das f√ºr besser als bu√üfertige Erbauungsstunden, die meinem Pfarrer
wohl gefielen, die mir aber nicht zu Herzen gingen und mir nur eine
grenzenlose Langeweile bereiten w√ºrden. Auch finde ich, da√ü der
Lebensgang von Meinesgleichen nirgends aufgeschrieben steht. Die B√ºcher,
die ich danach durchsucht habe, erz√§hlen nichts davon, und es w√§re
vielleicht doch gut, wenn die vornehmen und reichen Herren, die sich an
uns erg√∂tzen, die uns locken und sich von uns alle unm√∂glichen Dinge
aufbinden lassen, einmal erfahren w√ºrden, wie es in einem jener M√§dchen
aussieht, die sie so br√ºnstig in ihre Arme schlie√üen, woher es stammt,
was es erlebt hat, und was es denkt.

                   *       *       *       *       *

Mein Vater war ein blutarmer Sattlergehilfe, der in einem Gesch√§ft in
der Josefstadt arbeitete. Wir wohnten ganz weit drau√üen in Ottakring, in
einem damals neuen Hause, einer Zinskaserne, die von oben bis unten mit
armen Leuten angef√ºllt war. Alle diese Leute hatten viele Kinder, und im
Sommer war der Hof zu klein f√ºr ihre Schar. Ich selbst besa√ü zwei
Br√ºder, die beide um wenige Jahre √§lter waren als ich. Mein Vater, meine
Mutter, wir drei Kinder wohnten in einer K√ºche und einem Zimmer und
hatten noch einen Bettgeher mit dazu. Solche Bettgeher waren der Reihe
nach wohl ein halbes hundert bei uns; sie kamen und gingen, bald
friedlich, bald in Streit, und die meisten von ihnen verschwanden
spurlos, ohne da√ü wir jemals wieder etwas von ihnen h√∂rten. Ich erinnere
mich haupts√§chlich an zwei von ihnen. Der eine war ein Schlossergeselle,
ein schwarzer, traurig aussehender Bursche, der ganz kleine schwarze
Augen hatte, und immer voll Ru√ü im Gesicht war. Wir Kinder f√ºrchteten
uns vor ihm. Er war auch immer schweigsam und sprach kein Wort. Ich
entsinne mich, da√ü er eines Nachmittags nach Hause kam, w√§hrend ich
allein in der Wohnung mich befand. Ich war damals f√ºnf Jahre alt und
spielte am Boden des Zimmers. Meine Mutter war mit den beiden Buben am
F√ºrstenfeld, mein Vater von der Arbeit noch nicht zur√ºck. Der Schlosser
nahm mich vom Boden auf und hielt mich auf seinem Scho√ü. Ich wollte
schreien, aber er sagte leise: ¬ªSei stad, ich tu' dir nix!¬´ Und dann
legte er mich zur√ºck, hob mein R√∂ckchen auf, und betrachtete mich, wie
ich nackt vor ihm auf seinen Knien lag. Ich f√ºrchtete mich sehr vor ihm,
aber ich verhielt mich ganz still. Wie er meine Mutter kommen h√∂rte,
setzte er mich rasch auf den Fu√üboden und ging in die K√ºche. Ein paar
Tage sp√§ter kam er wieder fr√ºhzeitig nach Hause und die Mutter ersuchte
ihn auf mich aufzupassen. Er versprach es, und hielt mich wieder die
ganze Zeit auf seinen Knien, in Betrachtung meines nackten Mittelst√ºckes
begriffen. Er sprach kein Wort, sondern schaute nur immer auf die eine
Stelle hin, und ich traute mich auch nicht, etwas zu reden. Das
wiederholte sich, solange er bei uns wohnte, einigemale. Ich begriff
nichts davon, und machte mir auch, nach Kinderart, keine Gedanken
dar√ºber. Heute wei√ü ich, was das bedeutet hat, und nenne den
Schlossergesellen oft meinen ersten Geliebten.

Von dem zweiten Bettgeher werde ich sp√§ter reden.

Meine beiden Br√ºder Franz und Lorenz waren sehr ungleich. Lorenz, der
√§lteste, er war um vier Jahre √§lter als ich, war immer sehr
verschlossen, in sich gekehrt, flei√üig und heilig. Franz, der nur
anderthalb Jahre mehr z√§hlte als ich, war dagegen lustig, und er hielt
sich auch viel mehr zu mir als zum Lorenz. Ungef√§hr sieben Jahre war ich
alt geworden, als ich eines Nachmittags mit Franz zu Nachbarskindern auf
Besuch ging. Es war auch ein Bruder und eine Schwester, und diese Kinder
waren immer allein, weil sie keine Mutter hatten, und ihr Vater in die
Arbeit gehen mu√üte. Die Anna war damals schon neun Jahre alt, ein
blasses, mageres, wei√üblondes M√§dchen mit einer gespaltenen Lippe. Und
ihr Bruder Ferdl, ein dreizehnj√§hriger, robuster Bub, auch ganz
wei√üblond, aber rotwangig und breitschultrig. Wir spielten zuerst ganz
harmlos. Da sagte die Anna auf einmal: ¬ªSpiel'n wir doch Vater und
Mutter.¬´ Ihr Bruder lachte und sagte: ¬ªDie will immer nur Vater und
Mutter spielen.¬´ Aber Anna bestand darauf, trat zu meinem Bruder Franz
und meinte: ¬ªAlso du bist der Mann und ich bin die Frau.¬´ Und Ferdl war
gleich bei mir, fa√üte mich am Arm und erkl√§rte: ¬ªDa bin dann halt ich
dein Mann und du meine Frau.¬´ Sofort nahm Anna zwei Polster√ºberz√ºge,
machte zwei Wickelkinder daraus, und gab mir eines. ¬ªDa hast dazu ein
Kind¬´, meinte sie. Ich begann die Lappendocke gleich zu wiegen, aber
Anna und Ferdl lachten mich aus. ¬ªSo geht das nicht. Z'erst mu√ü man das
Kind machen, dann mu√ü man in der Hoffnung sein, dann mu√ü man es kriegen,
und dann erst kann man's hutschen!¬´ Ich hatte nat√ºrlich schon manchmal
davon reden geh√∂rt, da√ü Frauen ¬ªin der Hoffnung¬´ sind, da√ü sie ein Kind
kriegen werden. An den Storch glaubte ich auch nicht mehr so recht, und
wenn ich Frauen mit einem gro√üen Bauch sah, wu√üte ich ungef√§hr, was das
bedeutet. Aber genauere Vorstellungen davon hatte ich bisher nicht
gehabt. Auch mein Bruder Franz nicht. Wir standen deshalb g√§nzlich
verdutzt und ratlos da, und wu√üten nicht, wie wir dieses Spiel werden
versuchen, oder uns daran beteiligen k√∂nnen. Aber Anna war schon zu
Franz getreten und griff nach seinem Hosent√ºrl. ¬ªKomm nur¬´, sagte sie,
¬ªtu ihn heraus, dein' Zipfel!¬´ Und dabei hatte sie ihm die Hose auch
gleich aufgekn√∂pft und seinen ¬ªZipfel¬´ zum Vorschein gebracht. Ferdl und
ich sahen zu. Ferdl lachend. Ich mit einem Gef√ºhl, das aus Neugierde,
Staunen, Entsetzen und noch einer besonderen, mir bisher fremden
Erregung gemischt war. Franz stand ganz bewegungslos da, und wu√üte
nicht, wie ihm geschah. Unter Annas Ber√ºhrung richtete sich sein
¬ªZipfel¬´ ganz steif in die H√∂he. ¬ªJetzt komm¬´, h√∂rte ich Anna leise
fl√ºstern. Ich sah, wie sie sich auf den Boden warf, ihre R√∂cke hob und
die Beine spreizte. In diesem Moment ergriff mich Ferdl. ¬ªLeg dich
nieder¬´, zischelte er mir zu, und dabei sp√ºrte ich auch schon seine Hand
zwischen meinen Beinen. Ganz willig legte ich mich auf den Boden, hatte
meine R√∂cke aufgeschlagen, und Ferdl rieb sein steifes Glied an meiner
Fut. Ich mu√üte lachen, denn sein Schwanz kitzelte mich nicht wenig, weil
er mir auch auf dem Bauch und sonst √ºberall herumfuhr. Er keuchte dabei,
und lag schwer auf meiner Brust. Mir kam das Ganze unsinnig und
l√§cherlich vor, nur eine kleine Aufregung war in mir, und nur dieser
allein ist es wohl zuzuschreiben, da√ü ich liegen blieb, ja sogar
ernsthaft wurde. Ferdl wurde pl√∂tzlich ruhig und sprang auf. Ich erhob
mich gleichfalls, und er zeigte mir jetzt seinen ¬ªZipfl¬´, den ich ruhig
in die Hand nahm. Ein kleiner heller Tropfen war auf der Spitze zu
sehen. Dann zog Ferdl die Vorhaut zur√ºck, und ich sah die Eichel zum
Vorschein kommen. Ich schob nun die Vorhaut ein paarmal hin und her,
spielte damit, und freute mich, wenn die Eichel, wie der rosige Kopf
eines kleinen Tieres hervorspitzte. Anna und mein Bruder lagen noch auf
dem Boden, und ich sah, wie Franz ganz aufgeregt hin und her wetzte. Er
hatte rote Wangen und keuchte, ganz wie Ferdl vorhin. Aber auch Anna war
ganz ver√§ndert. Ihr bleiches Gesicht hatte sich gef√§rbt, ihre Augen
waren geschlossen, und ich glaubte, ihr sei schlecht geworden. Dann
wurden die beiden auch pl√∂tzlich still, lagen ein paar Sekunden
aufeinander, und standen dann auf. Wir sa√üen eine Weile zusammen. Ferdl
hielt mich unter den R√∂cken mit der Hand an der Mitte, Franz tat
dasselbe mit Anna. Ich hatte Ferdls Schwanz in der Hand, Anna den meines
Bruders; und es war mir ganz angenehm, wie Ferdl bei mir herumfingerte.
Es kitzelte mich, aber nicht mehr so, da√ü ich lachen mu√üte, sondern so,
da√ü mir ein Wohlgef√ºhl durch den ganzen K√∂rper lief. Diese Besch√§ftigung
wurde von Anna unterbrochen, die jetzt die beiden Puppen nahm, von denen
sie die eine sich selbst unter das Kleid auf den Bauch legte, die andere
mir. ¬ªSo¬´, sagte sie. ¬ªJetzt sind wir in der Hoffnung.¬´ Wir zwei gingen
nun im Zimmer herum, streckten unsere ausgestopften B√§uche heraus und
lachten dar√ºber. Dann brachten wir unsere Kinder zur Welt, wiegten sie
in den Armen, gaben sie unseren Ehem√§nnern, damit sie sie halten und
bewundern sollten, und spielten eine Weile wie unschuldige Kinder. Anna
kam auf die Idee, da√ü sie ihr Kind s√§ugen m√ºsse. Sie kn√∂pfte ihre Jacke
auf, zog das Hemd herab und tat so, als ob sie einem Kind die Brust
reichen w√ºrde. Ich bemerkte, da√ü sie schon leise anschwellende Warzen
hatte; und ihr Bruder trat hinzu und spielte damit; auch Franz machte
sich bald an Annas Brust zu schaffen, und Ferdl meinte, es sei schade,
da√ü ich keine Duteln habe. Dann kam eine Erkl√§rung vom Kindermachen. Wir
erfuhren, da√ü das, was wir eben getan hatten v√∂geln hei√üe, da√ü unsere
Eltern dasselbe tun, wenn sie miteinander im Bett liegen, und da√ü die
Frauen davon die Kinder bek√§men. Ferdl war schon ein Ausgelernter. Er
sagte uns M√§dchen, da√ü unsere Fut noch zugewachsen sei, da√ü man deshalb
nur von au√üen daran herumwetzen k√∂nne. Er sagte ferner, da√ü wir einmal,
wenn wir gr√∂√üer werden, Haare darauf bekommen, da√ü dann unser Loch sich
√∂ffnen wird, und da√ü man dann mit dem ganzen Schwanz hineinfahren k√∂nnen
wird. Ich wollte es nicht glauben, aber Anna erkl√§rte mir, Ferdl wisse
das ganz genau. Er habe auf dem Boden die Frau Reinthaler gev√∂gelt, und
da sei sein Schwanz ganz in ihr Loch hineingegangen. Die Frau Reinthaler
war die Frau eines Tramwaykondukteurs, der in unserem Haus im letzten
Stock wohnte. Es war eine dicke, schwarze Frau, klein und h√ºbsch und
immer sehr freundlich. Ferdl erz√§hlte uns die Geschichte: ¬ªDie Frau
Reinthaler ist vom Waschen 'kommen. Ein' ganzen Korb voller W√§sch' hats
'tragen, und ich bin g'rad auf der Stieg'n g'wesen. Na, und wie ichs
gr√º√üt hab' sagt sie zu mir: `Geh Ferdl, bist ein starker Bub, k√∂nntst
mir wirklich helfen, den schweren Korb am Boden tragen.¬¥ So bin ich halt
mit ihr auffi gangen, und wie wir droben sein, fragt sie mich, `was
willst denn jetzt daf√ºr, da√ü du mir g'holfen hast?¬¥ -- `Nix¬¥, sag ich
drauf. `Komm, ich zeig' dir was¬¥, sagt sie, packt mich bei der Hand und
legt sich's auf die Brust. `Gelt ja, das ist gut?¬¥ Da hab' ich schon
g'wu√üt, was los ist, denn mit der Anna hab' ich ja schon oft fr√ºher
gewetzt -- was?¬´ -- Anna nickte bekr√§ftigend, als ob sich das alles ganz
von selbst verst√ºnde, Ferdl fuhr fort: ¬ªAber ich hab' mich doch nicht
getraut, und hab' nur ihre Brust fest z'sammendruckt. Sie hat sich
gleich ihr Leibl aufg'macht, und hat mir's alser nackter herausgeben,
und hat mich spielen lassen, und dann hat's mich bei der Nudel packt,
und hat alleweil gelacht, und hat g'sagt: `Wenn's d' niemanden was
ausplauschen m√∂chst, derfest noch was andres tun¬†...¬¥ -- `Ich red' nix¬¥,
hab' ich drauf g'sagt, -- `g'wi√ü nix?¬¥ fragt sie noch amal. `Nein, g'wi√ü
nix.¬¥ Na da hat sie sich √ºbern W√§schkorb g'legt, und hat mich auf sich
g'nommen, und hat mir den Schwanz mit der Hand hineingesteckt in ihre
Fut. Ganz drinn war er, ich hab's ganz genau g'sp√ºrt. Und die Haar, was
sie drauf hat, hab' ich auch g'sp√ºrt.¬´

Anna wollte noch nicht, da√ü die Erz√§hlung aus sei. ¬ªWar's gut?¬´ forschte
sie weiter. ¬ªSehr gut war's¬´, antwortete Ferdl trocken, ¬ªund g'sto√üen
hat sie, wie nicht g'scheit, und druckt hat's mich, und mit ihre Duteln
hab' ich spielen m√ºssen. Und wie's dann aus war, is sie rasch
aufg'sprungen, hat sich ihr Leibl zukn√∂pfelt und hat ein ganz b√∂ses
Gesicht g'macht. `Schau, da√ü d' weiterkommst, du Lausbub¬¥, hat's zu mir
g'sagt, `und wenn du dich verplauscht, rei√ü' ich dir dein Sch√§del
aber¬†...¬¥¬´ Ferdl machte ein ganz nachdenkliches Gesicht. Anna aber
meinte pl√∂tzlich: ¬ªGlaubst du nicht, da√ü er bei mir schon hineingeht?¬´
Ferdl sah sie an, sie hielt noch immer ihr Puppenkind an der blo√üen
Brust, und er griff sie an, strich wie versuchend daran herum, und sie
entschied endlich: ¬ªVersuch's ein bi√ül¬†...¬´ -- ¬ªAlsdann spielen wir
wieder Vater und Mutter¬´, schlug Anna vor. Franz ging gleich zu ihr, und
auch ich nahm jetzt, nach all den Belehrungen, die ich empfangen hatte,
und nach der Geschichte, die ich eben vernommen, diesen Vorschlag
bereitwillig an. Aber Anna wies Franz von sich. ¬ªNein¬´, sagte sie,
¬ªjetzt soll der Ferdl mein Mann sein, und du bist der Pepi ihrer.¬´ Damit
r√ºckte sie ihrem Bruder an die Seite, schob ihre Hand in seinen
Hosenspalt, und er griff ihr sogleich unter die R√∂cke. Ich packte Franz
und erinnere mich, da√ü ich das mit einer starken Aufregung tat. Als ich
seine kleine blo√üe Nudel aus der Hose nahm, und die Vorhaut auf- und
niederschob, spielte er mit seinen Fingern an meinem Loch, und da wir
jetzt beide wu√üten, wie's gemacht wird, lagen wir in der n√§chsten
Sekunde auf dem Boden, und ich regierte mit der Hand seinen Zapfen so
genau, da√ü er mir nicht den Bauch hinauffuhr, sondern mich genau in
meiner Spaltung bestreichelte. Dies machte mir ein Vergn√ºgen, von dem
ich im ganzen K√∂rper eine wohlige Spannung versp√ºrte, so da√ü auch ich
mich gegen ihn rieb und wetzte, wann ich nur konnte. Das dauerte eine
Weile, bis Franz ersch√∂pft auf mich fallend niedersank und sich nicht
r√ºhrte. Wir lagen ein paar Momente so, dann h√∂rten wir einen Disput
zwischen Ferdl und Anna, und schauten nach, was sie machten. Sie lagen
noch immer aufeinander, aber Anna hielt ihre beiden Beine so hoch, da√ü
sie √ºber Ferdls R√ºcken sich ber√ºhrten. ¬ªEr geht schon hinein¬†...¬´ sagte
Ferdl, aber Anna meinte: ¬ªJa, hinein geht er, aber weh tut's -- la√ü
gehn, es tut weh.¬´ Ferdl beruhigte sie: ¬ªDas macht nix, -- das ist im
Anfang -- wart nur, vielleicht geht er ganz hinein.¬´ Wir legten uns
flach auf den Boden, rechts und links von den beiden, um festzustellen,
ob Ferdl drin sei oder nicht. Er war wirklich ein wenig drin. Der untere
Teil von Annas Fummel war breit ge√∂ffnet, wie wir mit Staunen
wahrnahmen, und da drinnen steckte Ferdls Schwanz bis √ºber den Kopf und
fuhr unbeholfen hin und her. Wie Ferdl eine heftige Bewegung machte,
glitt er ganz hinaus, aber ich ergriff ihn sofort und f√ºgte ihn wieder
in Annas Eingang, der mir schon ganz rotgerieben vorkam. Ich hielt ihn
fest, und versuchte ihn tiefer hineinzudr√§ngen. Ferdl selbst stie√ü in
der Richtung, die ich ihm gab, kr√§ftig nach, aber Anna fing auf einmal
laut zu schreien an, so da√ü wir erschrocken auseinanderfuhren. Sie
weigerte sich, das Spiel fortzusetzen, und ich mu√üte Ferdl noch einmal
auf mich nehmen, weil er sich nicht beruhigen wollte. Nun war aber auch
ich einigerma√üen rot gerieben, und weil es inzwischen schon Zeit wurde,
gingen wir heim. Mein Bruder und ich sprachen auf dem Weg in unsere
Wohnung kein Wort. Wir wohnten auch im letzten Stockwerk dieses Hauses,
T√ºr an T√ºr mit der Frau Reinthaler. Als wir oben auf dem Gang ankamen,
sahen wir die kleine dicke Frau im Gespr√§ch mit einer anderen Nachbarin
stehen. Wir gafften sie an und begannen laut zu lachen. Als sie sich
nach uns umdrehen wollte, fl√ºchteten wir in unsere T√ºr.

Seit jenem Tage betrachtete ich Kinder und Erwachsene, M√§nner und Frauen
mit v√∂llig ver√§nderten Blicken. Ich war erst sieben Jahre alt, aber
meine Geschlechtlichkeit kam voll zum Ausbruch. Sie mu√ü in meinen Augen
zu lesen gewesen sein, mein ganzes Gesicht, mein Mund, mein Gang mu√ü
eine einzige Aufforderung gewesen sein, mich anzupacken und
hinzuschmei√üen. Nur so kann ich mir die Wirkung erkl√§ren, die damals
schon von mir ausging, die ich in der Folge √ºbte, und die es zustande
brachte, da√ü fremde und wie mir scheint, besonnene M√§nner gleich bei der
ersten Begegnung mit mir alle Vorsicht au√üer Acht lie√üen und
unbedenklich alles wagten. Diese Wirkung kann ich auch jetzt noch
bemerken, wo ich weder jung bin noch sch√∂n und wo mein K√∂rper welk
geworden und die Spuren meines Wandels greifbar zu erkennen gibt.
Trotzdem gibt es noch M√§nner, die auf den ersten Blick von mir in
Flammen geraten und sich dann in meinem Scho√ü wie die Rasenden geb√§rden.
Diese Wirkung mag schon viel fr√ºher t√§tig gewesen sein, als ich noch
wahrhaft unschuldig war, und vielleicht ist sie es gewesen, die den
Schlossergesellen dazu trieb, die Scham der F√ºnfj√§hrigen zu entbl√∂√üen.

Ein paar Tage sp√§ter waren wir Kinder allein zu Hause, und da begann der
Franz den Lorenz zu fragen, ob er denn wisse, woher die Kinder kommen
und wie sie gemacht werden. Lorenz meinte: ¬ªWei√üt du's vielleicht?¬´
Franz und ich lachten, und ich holte Franzens kleinen Stift aus dem
Hosent√ºrl, streichelte ihn ein wenig, w√§hrend Lorenz mit ernster Miene
zusah, wie Franz mich an meiner Spalte kitzelte. Dann legten wir uns
aufs Bett und spielten unser St√ºckchen, das wir von Anna und Ferdl
gelernt hatten, mit allem Talent herunter. Lorenz sprach kein Wort, auch
nicht, als wir fertig waren, aber als ich mich ihm n√§herte, und die Hand
in seine Hose stecken wollte, indem ich ihm sagte: ¬ªKomm, jetzt mu√üt
du's auch probieren¬†...¬´ stie√ü er mich weg und zu unserem gro√üen
Erstaunen erz√§hlte er: ¬ªDas V√∂geln kenn' ich schon l√§ngst. Glaubt's ihr
vielleicht, ich werd' auf euch warten? Aber das darf man nicht. Das ist
eine schwere S√ºnd', Unkeuschheit ist das, und wer v√∂gelt, kommt in die
H√∂ll'.¬´ Wir erschraken nicht wenig, aber dann bestritten wir die
Behauptung. ¬ªGlaubst du am End'¬´, fragten wir ihn, ¬ªda√ü der Vater und
die Mutter auch in die H√∂ll' kommen?¬´ Er war fest √ºberzeugt davon, und
gerade deshalb gaben wir alle Angst auf und verh√∂hnten ihn. Lorenz aber
drohte, er werde uns beim Vater, beim Lehrer und beim Katecheten
verklagen, und seitdem haben wir unsere kleinen Vergn√ºgungen niemals
wieder in seiner Gegenwart vorgenommen. Er wu√üte trotzdem, da√ü Franz und
ich fortfuhren, aufeinander zu liegen, oder uns mit anderen Kindern
abzugeben; aber er schwieg und wich uns aus.

Wir waren sehr oft bei Anna und Ferdl und spielten immer dasselbe. Immer
wurde ich zuerst vom Ferdl, Anna von Franz gev√∂gelt, dann die Anna von
ihrem Bruder und ich von dem meinigen. Trafen wir die beiden einmal
nicht daheim, oder mu√üten wir selbst zu Hause bleiben, dann v√∂gelten wir
eben allein. Aber es verging kein Tag, an dem wir nicht aufeinander
lagen. Unsere gemeinsamen Gespr√§che aber drehten sich nur um den
einzigen Wunsch, es einmal mit einem Gro√üen tun zu d√ºrfen. Anna und ich
w√ºnschten sich einen wirklichen, erwachsenen Mann, Ferdl und Franz
w√ºnschten sich die Frau Reinthaler.

Einmal als wir wieder zu Anna kamen, war Besuch da. Eine dreizehnj√§hrige
Kousine von ihr, Mizzi und ihr Bruder Poldl. Die Mizzi war ein h√ºbsches,
schon recht entwickeltes M√§dchen, und ihre jungen Br√ºste standen fest
und frei unter ihrer d√ºnnen Bluse. Es wurde nat√ºrlich gleich von dem
gesprochen, was uns am meisten interessierte, und Poldl r√ºhmte sich, da√ü
seine Schwester schon Haare auf der Fut h√§tte. Er hob ihr ganz ruhig die
Kleider auf, und wir sahen respektvoll auf das dreieckige, dunkle
B√ºschel, das sich dort befand, wo wir noch nackt waren. Dann wurden die
Br√ºste der Mizzi entbl√∂√üt und von uns allen bestaunt und gestreichelt.
Mizzi geriet in Aufregung. Sie schlo√ü die Augen, lehnte sich zur√ºck und
streckte die H√§nde nach Franz und nach ihrem Bruder aus. Jeder gab ihr,
was er in der Hose trug, zu halten, und Ferdl stellte sich zwischen ihre
Beine und spielte mit seinem Schwanz an ihrem Spalt. Endlich sprang sie
auf, eilte zum Bett, warf sich darauf und rief: ¬ªPoldl, komm her, ich
halt's nimmer aus.¬´ Ihr Bruder schwang sich zu ihr hinauf. Wir waren
alle um das Bett getreten und sahen zu. W√§hrend Ferdl seinen Schweif der
atemlos daliegenden Mizzi zu halten gab, vertraute Franz den seinigen
Annas H√§nden an; ich aber schaute voll Interesse zu, wie einmal
¬ªwirklich gev√∂gelt¬´ wird. Denn Mizzi und ihr Bruder, der erst zw√∂lf
Jahre alt war, erkl√§rten uns, da√ü sie es genauso machen k√∂nnten wie die
Gro√üen. Ich sah mit Verwunderung, wie Poldl seine Schwester auf den Mund
k√º√üte. Denn ich hatte bisher nicht gedacht, da√ü das K√ºssen mit
dazugeh√∂rt. Ich sah auch, wie Poldl Mizzis beide Br√ºste in der Hand
hielt, w√§hrend er auf ihr lag, sie fortw√§hrend streichelte und ich
bemerkte, wie die Brustwarzen spitz und hoch herausstanden. Ich sah, wie
Poldls Schweif g√§nzlich in dem schwarzen Haarb√ºschel seiner Schwester
verschwand, und griff selbst hin, um mich zu √ºberzeugen, ob er wirklich
in ihrem Leib steckte. Und ich war pl√∂tzlich furchtbar erregt, als ich
mit eigenen H√§nden f√ºhlte, wie Poldls Stange, die √ºbrigens viel gr√∂√üer
war als die von Franz und Ferdl, tief in Mizzis Leib hineinfuhr, bis ans
Ende, wieder herauskam, und wieder darin versank. Am meisten aber setzte
mich Mizzis Gehaben in Verwunderung. Sie warf sich mit ihrem Popo ihrem
Bruder entgegen, vollf√ºhrte hitzige St√∂√üe, zappelte mit den F√º√üen in der
Luft, war ganz atemlos und seufzte immerfort, so da√ü ich glaubte, es
m√ºsse ihr doch furchtbar weh tun. Ich merkte aber dann, da√ü es anders
war, als sie keuchend ein ums andere Mal ausrief: ¬ªFester! Fester! Noch
fester, so, so, gut, gut, gut, aah!¬´ Kaum hatte Poldl seinen Schwanz
herausgezogen und stieg vom Bett herab, als Ferdl und Franz sich
herandr√§ngten. Mizzi war mit gespreizten Beinen liegen geblieben, mit
nackten Schenkeln und mit nackten Br√ºsten. L√§chelnd sah sie zu, wie
Ferdl und Franz sich stie√üen, wer sie zuerst haben sollte, und eben als
die beiden Miene machten, miteinander ernstlich zu raufen, entschied sie
den Streit, indem sie nach meinem Bruder griff und erkl√§rte: ¬ªZuerst der
Kleine da!¬´ Franz warf sich auf Mizzi. Aber er fing an, sie in der Art
zu reiben, wie er es an mir und Anna gew√∂hnt war. Mizzi hielt seine
Bewegung auf, erwischte ihn am Zipfel und schob ihn mit einem Ruck in
die Spalte. Franz war ganz verbl√ºfft, h√∂rte auf, sich zu r√ºhren, und tat
so, als wollte er mit seinem Schwanz erst f√ºhlen, wo er sich befand.
Aber Mizzi duldete diese Ruhe nicht. Sie begann sich unter ihm zu
werfen, fing ihre Gegenst√∂√üe an, und gleich war Franz wieder
herausgerutscht ohne hineinzufinden. Jetzt half ich ihm aber, ich hielt
meine Hand hin und brachte ihn, wenn er ausgleiten wollte, jedesmal auf
den rechten Weg. Eine neue Schwierigkeit ergab sich, weil Mizzi durchaus
wollte, Franz solle mit ihren Br√ºsten spielen. Aber wenn er sie in die
Hand nahm und sie zu kitzeln und zu streicheln begann, verga√ü er ganz
das V√∂geln, und wenn ihn Mizzi dann wieder zum V√∂geln trieb, verga√ü er
ihre Br√ºste. Er konnte beides zugleich nicht bew√§ltigen, und Mizzi
beklagte sich schweratmend: ¬ªSchad is, der kann noch gar nix!¬´ Ferdl,
der ungeduldig dabeistand, bem√§chtigte sich jetzt der Duteln Mizzis,
dr√ºckte sie, k√º√üte sie auf die Warzen, da√ü sie wieder hoch aufgerichtet
wurden, und nahm damit Franz die eine H√§lfte seiner Aufgabe ab. Franz
kam in ein regelm√§√üiges schnelles Sto√üen, was Mizzi sehr recht war. Sie
seufzte und jammerte und schnalzte mit den Lippen, und warf sich hoch im
Bett in die H√∂he und sagte dabei zu uns: ¬ªAh, das ist gut, das ist gut,
der kleine Schwanz ist gut.¬´

Kaum waren sie fertig, als sich Ferdl mit gez√ºcktem Speer, ohne dabei
Mizzis Br√ºste loszulassen, seitlich aufs Bett und zwischen Mizzis Beine
schwang, die ihn begierig aufnahm. Auch dem Ferdl half ich die rechte
√ñffnung finden, und unterhielt mich, meine Finger an seinem Hodensack zu
halten, wodurch ich jedesmal genau f√ºhlte, wenn der Schwanz bis zum Rest
in Mizzi eindrang. Ferdl verk√ºndigte gleich das erstemal, als er
hineingeglitscht war, mit Sachkenntnis: ¬ªGanz so wie bei der Frau
Reinthaler.¬´ Und er zeigte sich so gewandt und geschickt im Bohren,
Sto√üen und Wetzen, da√ü das Bett unter den Beinen krachte und Mizzi laut
zu schnaufen begann. Wie nun die beiden fertig waren, wollten Anna und
ich auch unsern Teil haben. Mizzi hatte sich vom Bett erhoben, war eilig
heruntergesprungen, lachend, frisch, als w√§re gar nichts geschehen. Und
doch hatte sie dreimal hintereinander die verschiedenen Schw√§nze in sich
gehabt, und hatte eine Remmelei ausgehalten, die, wie ich glaube,
beinahe eine Stunde gedauert haben mu√ü. Sie brachte ihre Kleider unten
ein wenig in Ordnung, lie√ü aber ihre Br√ºste frei und meinte, jetzt wolle
sie zuschauen. Anna warf sich gleich aufs Bett und rief den Poldl, der
sie √ºberhaupt sehr zu interessieren schien. Aber Poldl hatte wieder mit
den Br√ºsten seiner Schwester zu tun. Er hob sie mit den F√§usten in die
H√∂he, pre√üte sie fest zusammen und nahm ihre Warzen in den Mund. Mizzi
lehnte an einem Schrank, lie√ü sich diese Liebkosungen mit Behagen
gefallen und bearbeitete daf√ºr ihres Bruders Schweif mit ihren H√§nden.
Anna lag vergebens auf dem Bett in Bereitschaft; denn Poldl hob nach ein
paar Minuten seiner Schwester die R√∂cke auf, und mit ihrer Beihilfe
brachte er seine Rute wieder in ihr unter. Stehend v√∂gelten die beiden
mit einer Heftigkeit, da√ü der Kasten pumperte. Wir hatten noch nicht
gewu√üt, da√ü man die Sache auch so betreiben k√∂nne, und schauten diese
neue Kunst mit Verwunderung an. Es war beinahe selbstverst√§ndlich, da√ü
dann wieder Franz an die Reihe kam. Er machte es diesmal besser, denn er
klammerte sich im Stehen an die Br√ºste von Mizzi, w√§hrend sie seinen
Schwanz nicht loslie√ü und daf√ºr sorgte, da√ü er nicht aus dem Geleise
kam, und zuletzt v√∂gelte auch Ferdl in dieser neuen Stellung Mizzi, die
jetzt die sechste Nummer sehr vergn√ºgt aushielt und nicht die Spur einer
Ersch√∂pfung zeigte.

Daf√ºr waren Anna und ich ganz entt√§uscht. Anna machte sich wieder an
Poldl heran, und versicherte ihm, da√ü man auch bei ihr hineink√§me, und
nicht auswendig zu wetzen brauche. Er hob ihr die R√∂cke auf, bohrte ein
wenig mit dem Finger in ihrer Fotze herum, und meinte, es ginge noch
nicht. Anna aber wollte ihn nicht loslassen. Sie hielt seinen Schweif in
der Hand, und arbeitete daran herum, denn er hing ganz matt und weich
herunter. Ich hatte mich zu Ferdl gewendet, fand aber keine Geneigtheit
bei ihm vor. Er erlaubte mir nur gn√§dig mit seinem Schweif zu spielen,
was ich auch tat. W√§hrenddessen betastete er nun meine Brust, die noch
ganz flach war, und meinte bedauernd: ¬ªDu hast halt keine Duteln.¬´ Ich
mu√üte es aufgeben, von ihm gev√∂gelt zu werden, und probierte nun Franz
zu kriegen. Mit dem war aber nichts zu machen, weil er wieder auf Mizzi
lag. Er v√∂gelte sie gerade nicht, spielte aber mit ihrer Brust, und als
ich ihm an die Hose griff, und sein Gezeug wieder stand, forderte er
mich auf, ihm wieder zu Mizzi hineinzuhelfen. Das mochte ich nicht, doch
er fand den Weg ohne mich, und am Boden liegend, machte Mizzi die
siebente Partie, die wohl die ausgiebigste war, weil sie mehr als eine
halbe Stunde dauerte.

An diesem Tage waren Anna und ich sehr entt√§uscht, und ich ging betr√ºbt
nach Hause, diese elende Mizzi, mit ihren Br√ºsten und ihren Haaren
verw√ºnschend. Daf√ºr wurde aber dann in den n√§chsten Wochen alles wieder
eingeholt. Mizzi und ihr Bruder wohnten weit weg und konnten nur selten
auf Besuch kommen. Und in der Zwischenzeit gen√ºgten Anna und ich unsern
beiden Partnern. Das Spiel ¬ªVater und Mutter¬´ wurde ganz ausgesetzt, wir
spielten jetzt nicht mehr, sondern v√∂gelten ganz ohne Vorwand, genau so
wie Mizzi und Poldl. Wir v√∂gelten stehend und liegend, und hatten, Anna
ebenso wie ich oft sogar Schmerzen zu leiden, weil Ferdl und Franz jetzt
durchaus immer probieren wollten, ob es nicht doch m√∂glich sei, uns ihre
Schw√§nze einzupfropfen. Es ging aber nicht.

Dieses Leben dauerte den ganzen Sommer. Dann zogen unsere Freunde in
eine andere Gegend, und ich sah die blonde Anna erst viel sp√§ter wieder.
Vorher aber war Mizzi mit ihrem Bruder noch einmal da, und mit ihnen war
ein gro√üer Bursch gekommen, der schon f√ºnfzehn Jahre alt war. Er hie√ü
Robert, war schon in der Lehre, und er √ºbernahm sogleich den Oberbefehl
√ºber unsere Spielerei. Als er uns seinen Schwanz zeigte, bemerkten wir,
da√ü er schon Haare hatte, und wir drei M√§dchen spielten lange mit ihm.
Wir streichelten ihn, liebkosten seine Eier, hielten seine Stange, die
sich ganz hei√ü anf√ºhlte, in unseren H√§nden und freuten uns, wenn wir sie
leise zucken f√ºhlten. Wir waren ganz entz√ºckt von ihm, denn er hatte
einen gro√üen, vollen Schweif, wie wir noch keinen gesehen. Mizzi
forderte ihn auf, mit ihr den Anfang zu machen. Er sagte: ¬ªNein. Ich
will zuerst die Pepi v√∂geln.¬´ Und ich erinnere mich, wie gro√ü meine
Freude war. Ich lief sofort zum Bett, legte mich r√ºcklings darauf und
indem ich mich aufdeckte, spreizte ich die Beine, um ihn zu empfangen.
Robert kam ans Bett, griff mich bei meiner nackten Fut an, und sagte:
¬ªUj jegerl, da kann man nur von au√üen wetzen.¬´ Mizzi rief eifrig
dazwischen: ¬ªAber nat√ºrlich, und nicht einmal Haar hat sie noch darauf,
geh v√∂gel mich, bei mir kannst du ihn ganz hineinstecken, wei√üt schon.¬´
Und schon lag sie auch neben mir im Bett und wollte mich verdr√§ngen.
Aber Robert antwortete: ¬ªDas gibt's net, ich will die Pepi v√∂geln.¬´ Ich
lag ganz still und schaute ihn an, und er war sehr rot im Gesicht und
rieb mir fortw√§hrend seinen Finger in die Spalte, so da√ü ich geil wurde
wie noch nie. Er √ºberlegte einen Augenblick, dann erkl√§rte er: ¬ªIch
werd' euch was zeigen.¬´ Nun rief er Anna, die sich auch ins Bett, aber
an die Wand legen mu√üte. Ich lag in der Mitte, Mizzi am √§u√üersten Rand.
Robert stieg ins Bett, legte sich aber nicht auf mich, sondern befahl
mir: ¬ªDreh dich um.¬´ Ich lag nun auf dem Bauch, und er schob mir die
Kleider in die H√∂he, so da√ü mein Popo entbl√∂√üt war. Anna mu√üte h√∂her
gegen das Kopfende des Bettes kriechen, so da√ü sich ihre Fut neben
meiner Schulter befand. Er deckte sie auch auf. Und von Mizzi verlangte
er, da√ü sie ihre Br√ºste entbl√∂√üe. Sie lie√ü ihr Hemd herab, und ich sah,
da√ü ihre Brustwarzen wieder spitz hervorgetreten waren. Jetzt nahm
Robert mich unter dem Bauch, da√ü mein Popo ein bi√üchen in die H√∂he kam.
Er hie√ü mich, die Schenkel fest zusammenpressen und schob mir seinen
Schweif von hinten nach vorne, so da√ü ich die hei√üe Nudel an den
Hinterbacken am Damme und au√üen zwischen meiner Spalte sp√ºrte und so
zwischen Schenkeln, Damm und Popo hielt ich ihn ganz eingeschlossen.
Robert zog die Hand unter meinem Bauch hervor und begann leise zu
sto√üen. Ich versp√ºrte eine solche Annehmlichkeit, da√ü es mir durch alle
Glieder fuhr. Pl√∂tzlich begann ich wie Mizzi zu st√∂hnen und zu seufzen
und erwiderte seine St√∂√üe mit meinem Popo. Den Kopf hatte ich im Bett so
vergraben, da√ü ich nichts sah, sondern nur empfand, wie Robert mich
v√∂gelte. Zu meinem Erstaunen aber h√∂rte ich auch Anna und Mizzi seufzen
und √§chzen. Ich schaute auf und sah, wie Robert mit der linken Hand ganz
an der Fut von Anna spielte, und er mu√ü es sehr gut getan haben, denn
sie warf sich hin und her. Mit der rechten Hand spielte Robert auf einer
Brustwarze von Mizzi, die immer h√∂her und spitzer wurde. Dabei v√∂gelte
er mich in langsamen St√∂√üen und atmete schwer. Ferdl und Franz standen
neben dem Bett und schauten zu. Mizzi schrie am lautesten: ¬ªAh, ah, --
ich will was in die Fut, ah, Franzl, Ferdl, steckt's mir ihn einer
hinein, -- ah, ich mu√ü v√∂geln. -- kleiner Franzl komm¬†...¬´ Sie tastete
mit der einen Hand herum, und Franz beeilte sich, ihr seinen Schwanz zu
geben. Sie ri√ü ihn zu sich, und Franz lag nun neben Robert auf dem Bett
und v√∂gelte Mizzi nach Noten. Dabei hatte er wieder die Annehmlichkeit,
da√ü Robert ihm die Pflicht abnahm, mit den Br√ºsten Mizzis zu spielen.
Denn Robert lie√ü nicht nach. Mizzi war so geil, da√ü sie wieder ihre Hand
ausstreckte und diesmal gab ihr ihr Bruder Poldl seinen Schwanz zu
halten. Sie fuhr daran herum, Poldl war auch ganz aufgeregt, und auf
einmal hatte sie den Schwanz zwischen ihren Lippen in den Mund genommen
und begann daran zu saugen. Ferdl, der leer ausgegangen war, hielt es
nicht mehr aus. √úber den Kopf von Mizzi weg kroch er in das Bett zu
seiner Schwester Anna, nahm ihren Kopf und stie√ü ihr seinen Schwanz in
den Mund. Sie lie√ü sich's nicht nur ruhig gefallen, es schien sie sogar
nur noch mehr aufzureizen, und ich schaute ihr zu, wie sie an dem
Zapfen, der in ihren Mund ein- und ausfuhr, leckte und schmatzte. So
waren wir hier alle sieben auf einmal besch√§ftigt. Robert fuhr fort mich
langsam zu v√∂geln, und mir war es, als habe ich noch nie etwas gef√ºhlt,
das so gut war wie dieser dicke, hei√üe Schweif. Auf einmal wurde Roberts
Schweifsto√ü heftiger und rascher, und pl√∂tzlich sp√ºrte ich mit
Schrecken, da√ü ich mit etwas Nassem, Hei√üem am Bauch √ºbergossen wurde.
Ich schrie auf. Aber Robert fuhr mich, emsig wetzend an: ¬ªSei stad, mir
kommt's jetzt.¬´ Ich wehrte mich und wollte weg: ¬ªDu tust mich ja
anbrunzen.¬´ Er sagte: ¬ªNein, ich tu' spritzen -- das mu√ü sein.¬´ Danach
war er fertig. Wir l√∂sten uns alle voneinander, und alle waren √ºber die
Neuigkeit, da√ü Robert gespritzt hatte, ganz erstaunt. Robert versicherte
uns, da√ü Ferdl, Franz und Poldl noch zu klein seien und da√ü deshalb nur
ein kleines Tr√∂pferl erscheine, wenn's ihnen kommt. Bis sie Haare auf
dem Schwanz kriegen, w√ºrden sie auch so viel spritzen wie er.

Mizzi wollte wissen: ¬ªWirst du mich jetzt v√∂geln?¬´ Aber die Buben, Anna
und ich verlangten Robert spritzen zu sehen. Robert war dazu bereit.
¬ªIhr m√º√üt's mir's halt mit der Hand machen¬´, meinte er. Aber wir kannten
das nicht. So zeigte er uns, wie man die Sache anf√§ngt, indem er sich in
einen Sessel setzte und sich einen abzuwichsen begann. Das begriffen wir
bald und wetteiferten darin, Robert einen herunterzurei√üen. Abwechselnd
bearbeiteten Anna, Mizzi und ich sein steif dastehendes Glied, und Mizzi
begann es in den Mund zu nehmen und daran zu saugen. Sie tat es mit
solcher Begierde, da√ü der lange Spargel beinahe g√§nzlich in ihrem Mund
verschwand. Wir beiden anderen sahen ihr zu, und Anna wollte sie
abl√∂sen. Aber Robert ergriff mich bei den Haaren, stie√ü Mizzi zur Seite
und dr√§ngte meinen Mund gegen seinen Schweif. Nun war ich daran. Ich
hatte nicht viel Zeit zu √ºberlegen, spitzte die Lippen und empfing
dieses Ding, das ich schon von einer andern Stelle meines Leibes her
kannte. Aber kaum sp√ºrte ich, wie er in meinen Mund eindrang, als ich
von einer ungeahnten Geilheit ergriffen wurde. Jedes Hin und Her und
jedes Aus und Ein versp√ºrte ich in meiner noch verschlossenen Fut und
wie ich so auf- und abfuhr an Roberts Schweif, hatte ich auf einmal eine
Ahnung, wie das wirkliche V√∂geln sein m√ºsse. Nach mir kam Anna an die
Reihe. Aber kaum hatte sie ein wenig geleckt, als Robert zu spritzen
begann. Sie fuhr zur√ºck und spuckte die erste Ladung, die sie erhalten
hatte, aus. Robert erfa√üte seinen Schwanz und ri√ü sich den kalten Bauer
bis zu Ende herunter, und wir dr√§ngten uns alle um ihn, um das
Schauspiel zu sehen. Ruckweise wurde die wei√üe, dicke Masse in gro√üen
Tropfen emporgeschleudert, so hoch, da√ü ich einen ganzen Patzen davon
ins Gesicht bekam. Wir waren alle voll Bewunderung und furchtbar
aufgeregt.

Mizzi fiel gleich wieder √ºber Robert her und bat ihn: ¬ªAber jetzt, jetzt
wirst du mich v√∂geln, willst du!¬´ Doch Roberts Schweif war schlapp
geworden und hing wie erm√ºdet herab. ¬ªEs geht nicht¬´, meinte Robert, ¬ªer
steht mir nimmer.¬´ Mizzi war au√üer sich. Sie setzte sich zwischen
Roberts Knie auf den Fu√üboden, nahm seinen Schwanz und saugte daran,
schob sich ihn ganz in den Mund, schmatzte und leckte und rief
dazwischen zu Robert aufsehend: ¬ªAber wenn er wieder steht, dann v√∂gelst
du mich, was?¬´

Unterdessen wollten die anderen, Franz, Poldl und Ferdinand, das
neuentdeckte Mundv√∂geln auch erproben. Anna und ich mu√üten herhalten,
und es ging ganz leicht, denn ihre Schw√§nze waren alle noch klein und
viel d√ºnner als der von Robert. Ich nahm Annas Bruder, Ferdl, Anna nahm
Franz. Ferdl war so rasend, da√ü er mir seinen Schweif bis in die Kehle
stie√ü. Ich mu√üte ihn an der Wurzel halten und fuhr nun selbst sanfter
hin und her. Nach zehn-, zw√∂lfmalen kam es ihm. Ich f√ºhlte das Zucken,
sp√ºrte aber nichts Nasses, weil ja nur ein Tropfen kam. Mir aber war es,
als h√§tte ich den Schwanz tief in meiner Fut gehabt, und ich sp√ºrte,
da√ü auch mir etwas kommen m√ºsse. Ich hielt Ferdls Schweif im Mund, bis
er ganz weich geworden war. Und weil die Anna immer noch den Franz
schleckte, nahm ich gleich den Poldl, der schon wartete. Poldl hatte
diese Sache mit seiner Schwester erfunden. Er war sehr geschickt, und
ich konnte mich ruhig verhalten, indessen er so geschickt aus- und
einfuhr, als sei er in einer Fut. Mich befiel ein Jucken, ein Krampf,
eine Wonne, die ich nicht beschreiben m√∂cht, ohne zu wissen was ich tat,
spielte ich mit meiner Zunge an dem Schweif, der mir im Mund war, was
nur bewirkte, da√ü es Poldl sofort kam. Er hielt mich am Genick fest auf
seinen Schweif gedr√ºckt, und das Klopfen seiner Adern erh√∂hte mein
Lustgef√ºhl. Auch ihn behielt ich, bis er ganz weich war.

Dann schauten wir uns nach Anna und Franz um. Mizzi lag noch immer vor
Robert am Boden und sog an seiner weichen Nudel. Anna aber h√∂rte auf
einmal zu schlecken auf und sagte: ¬ªProbiern wir's, vielleicht geht er
doch hinein.¬´ Franz warf sich an sie und wir eilten hin, um zuzuschauen.
Sei es nun, da√ü der Schweif von Franz so klein war oder da√ü er durch den
Speichel, der auf ihm haftete, besser glitschte oder da√ü die vielen
Bohrversuche, die Anna und ihr Bruder vorgenommen hatten, schon den Weg
geebnet haben mochten, genug es ging. ¬ªEr ist drin¬´, rief Anna und
jubelte. ¬ªDrin is er¬´, rief Franz, und ich erkundigte mich bei Anna, ob
es weh tue. Aber ich bekam keine Antwort. Denn die zwei v√∂gelten mit
einer Vehemenz, da√ü ihnen H√∂ren und Sehen verging. Erst nachher sagte
mir Anna, das sei doch das Beste gewesen.

Mittlerweile hatte Mizzi Erfolg gehabt. Sie hatte Roberts Zipfel so
lange gereizt und gewuzelt, bis er sich wieder aufrichtete und Robert
bereit war, sie endlich zu v√∂geln. Franz und Anna konnten nicht schnell
genug Platz machen. Und Mizzi war wie eine Verr√ºckte. Sie hielt sich
selbst bei den Br√ºsten. Sie nahm einen Finger Roberts nach dem andern,
und steckte sich ihn in den Mund, sie fuhr mit der Hand herunter,
erwischte Roberts Schweif, dr√ºckte ihn z√§rtlich und stie√ü sich ihn dann
wieder tief hinein. Sie schleuderte sich unter ihm, da√ü das Bett
krachte. Auf einmal lie√ü Robert seinen Kopf sinken, ergriff eine Brust
von Mizzi und begann an ihrer Warze zu lecken und sie in den Mund zu
stecken, genau so wie wir's mit seinem Schweif getan hatten. Mizzi
weinte und jammerte vor Geilheit: ¬ªV√∂gel mich, v√∂gel mich¬´, jammerte
sie, ¬ªalle Tag mu√üt du mich v√∂geln¬†..., das ist ein Schwanz, ein guter
Schwanz ist das¬†..., fester sto√üen¬†..., noch fester, noch, noch ... nimm
die andere Dutel auch¬†..., die andere Dutel auch zuzeln, fester,
schneller, ah, ah ... noch fester ... und du wirst morgen wieder
v√∂geln? ... Du? Morgen ... komm morgen nachmittag¬†..., alle Tag mu√üt du
mich v√∂geln¬†..., Jesus, Maria und Josef ... ah ... ah!¬´ Robert stie√ü ein
kurzes Grunzen aus und spritzte ... Mizzi lag wie tot da.

Es war kein Zweifel. Robert war die Hauptperson. Anna freute sich, da√ü
sie nun endlich wie eine Gro√üe gev√∂gelt habe. Allein an diesem Tag
achtete niemand von uns darauf. Und Robert erz√§hlte uns, da√ü er schon
seit zwei Jahren v√∂gele. Seine Stiefmutter hat ihn dazu abgerichtet.
Sein Vater war gel√§hmt und schlief im Zimmer mit der Mutter. Robert
schlief in der K√ºche allein. Eines Abends, als er in der K√ºche war, der
Vater war noch wach, kam die Mutter heraus. Und wie es langsam dunkel
wurde, r√ºckte sie ganz nah zu Robert heran. Sie sa√üen auf der
K√ºchenbank nebeneinander. Und da fing sie an ihn zu streicheln. Zuerst
am Kopf. Dann die H√§nde. Dann die Schenkel und endlich schl√ºpfte sie mit
ihrer Hand in seine Hose. Sein Schweif wurde gleich hart und stellte
sich auf, kaum da√ü die Mutter ihn ber√ºhrte. Sie spielte eine Weile mit
ihm, und er griff ihr, rasend in seiner Aufregung, an die Brust. Da lie√ü
sie ihn los, um selbst das Kleid aufzukn√∂pfeln, und sie lie√ü ihn mit
ihrem nackten Busen spielen, f√ºhrte ihn selbst zu den Brustwarzen und
zeigte ihm, wie er es machen solle. Und sie atmete dabei so laut, da√ü
der Vater aus dem Zimmer herausrief, was denn los sei. Die Mutter
antwortete schnell: ¬ªNichts, nichts, ich bin nur beim Robertl da.¬´ Dabei
hielt sie Robert wieder am Schwanz und streichelte ihn. In der Nacht
aber, als der Vater schlief, kam sie zu ihm im Hemd heraus, stieg zu
Robert ins K√ºchenbett, setzte sich rittlings auf und steckte sich seinen
kleinen Schwanz hinein. Robert lag auf dem R√ºcken und r√ºhrte sich nicht.
Aber wie die Duteln seiner Mutter so √ºber seinem Gesicht hingen, griff
er wieder danach und spielte mit ihren Brustwarzen, und sie beugte sich
tiefer nieder, damit er bald die eine, bald die andere ihrer beiden
Br√ºste in den Mund nehmen k√∂nne. Und da ward ihm sehr wohl dabei, und er
v√∂gelte seine Stiefmutter, bis es ihr kam, und sie schwer auf ihn
niedersank.

Am n√§chsten Abend sa√ü er wieder mit ihr in der K√ºche, und sie spielten
wieder miteinander wie gestern; und in der Nacht, wenn der Vater
eingeschlafen war, kam sie wieder zu ihm heraus und lie√ü sich von ihm
v√∂geln. Einmal aber kam sie nicht, obwohl er vorher in der K√ºche mit ihr
gespielt hatte. Er konnte nicht einschlafen und sa√ü im Bett aufrecht
und konnte, weil der Mond ins Zimmer schien, auf die beiden Betten
hinschauen, in denen seine Eltern lagen. Und da sah er, wie die Mutter
rittlings auf dem Vater sa√ü. Sie war ganz nackt und hob sich auf und
nieder, und beugte sich herab und schob ihre Br√ºste dem Mann, der sich
nicht r√ºhren konnte, abwechselnd in den Mund. Robert wartete bis sie
fertig waren, dann rief er nach der Mutter, als sei ihm schlecht. Sie
kam zu ihm heraus und erkannte gleich, da√ü er durch die d√ºnnen Vorh√§nge
der T√ºrfenster im Mondlicht alles beobachtet haben m√ºsse. ¬ªHast was
g'sehn?¬´ fragte sie ihn. Robert antwortete ¬ªJa, -- alles.¬´ Sie gab ihm
sofort ihre Br√ºste zum Spielen und legte sich zu ihm ins Bett. ¬ªDiesmal
sollst du oben liegen¬´, versprach sie. Robert hatte das noch nie getan.
Sie zeigte ihm, wie er es machen solle, und sie zog ihr Hemd aus, so da√ü
sie ganz nackt vor ihm lag. Robert v√∂gelte sie mit aller Kraft, denn er
war furchtbar geil. Aber kaum hatte er seinen Schwanz hinausgesteckt,
als der Vater aus dem Zimmer herausschrie: ¬ªWas will denn der Robert?¬´
Die Mutter dr√ºckte ihn fester in sich hinein und rief zur√ºck: ¬ªMich will
er.¬´ Der Vater wollte wissen: ¬ªWas will er denn?¬´ Und v√∂gelnd antwortete
dann die Mutter: ¬ªAch nichts, jetzt ist ihm schon besser.¬´ Bald darauf
schlief der Vater ein, und die zwei arbeiteten weiter. Robert erz√§hlte,
da√ü sie ein paarmal aufh√∂ren mu√üten, weil das Bett so laut krachte. Als
er dann fertig war, wollte seine Mutter es noch einmal haben, und weil
ihm seine Nudel nicht gleich stand, nahm sie sie in den Mund und suzelte
daran, so lange, bis Robert beinahe laut aufgeschrien h√§tte vor Wonne.
Und dann mu√üte er aus dem Bett, mu√üte sich auf den K√ºchensessel
niedersetzen, und seine Mutter sa√ü so fest auf ihm, da√ü sie ihn beinahe
erdr√ºckt h√§tte. Zuletzt zog sie ihr Hemd wieder an und ging zu ihrem
Manne hinein. Robert aber mu√üte den n√§chsten Tag im Bett bleiben, so
schwach war er von dieser Nacht. Da sah der Vater, da√ü ihm wirklich
schlecht gewesen sei. Jetzt v√∂gelte Robert seine Stiefmutter seit zwei
Jahren beinahe alle Tage. Wir hatten einen gro√üen Respekt vor ihm, als
er uns die Geschichte erz√§hlte, und wir waren wieder alle bereit zu
v√∂geln, denn an der ganzen Sache hatte uns das oben Liegen am meisten
interessiert. Robert aber meinte, es g√§be noch andere Arten. Er habe
seine Stiefmutter auch schon von hinten gev√∂gelt, und ich bemerkte, das
sei sehr angenehm, ich h√§tte es ja von ihm auch so gekriegt. Anna und
Mizzi wollten das oben Liegen probieren. Anna nahm sich Franz, weil
seine Nudel die einzige war, die zu ihr hinein pa√üte, und Mizzi mu√üte
mit ihrem Bruder Poldl die Sache versuchen. Ich wollte es auch haben,
jedoch stand er dem Robert und dem Ferdl nicht, und so begann ich den
Ferdl wieder zu schlecken, bis er mich auf sich legen lie√ü und mir die
Spalte wetzte, da√ü es mir kam. Robert allein schlo√ü sich der allgemeinen
Geselligkeit nicht mehr an, weil er, wie er sagte, sich doch noch etwas
f√ºr seine Mutter aufheben m√ºsse, die ja sicherlich am Abend wieder zu
ihm kommen werde.

Kurze Zeit darauf zogen Anna und Ferdl mit ihrem Vater in eine andere
Wohnung. Ich war jetzt mit Franz allein. Wir v√∂gelten nimmer, weil wir
in unserer Wohnung wegen des Lorenz und wegen der Mutter nicht so
ungeniert waren. Ich schlief, wie schon gesagt, im Zimmer meiner Eltern
und verlegte mich nun darauf, sie zu belauschen. Oft genug h√∂rte ich die
Betten krachen, h√∂rte den Vater schnaufen und die Mutter seufzen,
konnte aber im Finstern nichts ausnehmen. Jedesmal geriet ich aber in
eine heftige Aufregung und begann mit dem Finger an meiner Muschel zu
spielen, bis ich endlich die Fertigkeit erreicht hatte, mich selbst, so
gut es ging, zu befriedigen. Oft h√∂rte ich auch leise Gespr√§che. Eines
Abends, an einem Samstag, kam der Vater nach Hause, w√§hrend wir schon
schliefen. Ich wachte auf und bemerkte, da√ü er angetrunken war. Im
Zimmer brannte ein Licht. Die Mutter war aufgestanden und half ihm beim
Auskleiden. Wie er nun im Hemd war, haschte er nach ihrer Brust, sie
wehrte ihn ab, doch er packte sie und fl√ºsterte: ¬ªGeh her, Alte, gib die
F√º√ü' auseinand.¬´ Meine Mutter wollte nicht: ¬ªGib an Ruh', du bist
b'soffen.¬´ -- ¬ªWann ich auch b'soffen bin, das macht nix¬†...¬´ -- ¬ªNein,
ich mag nit.¬´ -- ¬ªAh, was!¬´ Mein Vater war ein starker Mann mit einem
gro√üen Schnurrbart und wilden Augen. Ich sah, wie er die Mutter ergriff,
ihr das Hemd abri√ü, sie bei beiden Br√ºsten packte und aufs Bett warf, so
da√ü er gleich auf ihr lag. Meine Mutter spreizte quer √ºber dem Bett die
Beine und wehrte sich nicht mehr. Sie sagte nur: ¬ªL√∂sch das Licht doch
aus!¬´ Der Vater fuhr auf ihr herum und herrschte sie an: ¬ªSteck'n doch
hinein! Sakra!¬´ Die Mutter wiederholte: ¬ªErst l√∂sch das Licht aus, wenn
eins von die Kinder aufwacht¬†...¬´ Er brummte: ¬ªAh was, die schlafen ganz
gut¬´, und blieb auf ihr liegen und gleich darauf begannen seine St√∂√üe
und ich h√∂rte die Mutter sagen: ¬ªAh, das ist gut, h√∂rst, was du heut f√ºr
einen gro√üen Tremmel hast, ah, langsamer, sch√∂n langsam hin und her und
ganz tief hinein, ganz tief¬†..., jetzt schneller, schneller¬†...,
schneller ... und jetzt spritz, spritz, was d'kannst!! Aaaah!¬´ Mein
Vater stie√ü ein tiefes Brummen aus, dann waren sie beide still. Nach
einer Weile l√∂schten sie das Licht aus und bald h√∂rte ich sie alle zwei
schnarchen. Ich schl√ºpfte aus dem Bett, schlich zum Ledersofa, auf dem
Franz schlief. Er war wach, hatte von seinem Platz aus nichts sehen
k√∂nnen, aber alles geh√∂rt. Sofort war er auf mir. Ich drehte mich aber
um, legte mich auf den Bauch, wie ich's von Robert gelernt hatte und
lie√ü mir's von r√ºckw√§rts machen. Wir verfuhren sehr leise, und niemand
h√∂rte uns. Ich bemerkte aber dabei, da√ü es des Nachts und nackt, wie wir
alle beide waren, viel besser sei. Und nun v√∂gelten wir ein wenig √∂fter,
weil wir es nachts wagen konnten, wenn wir sicher waren, da√ü alles
schlief.

Etliche Monate nach unserer Trennung von Anna und ihrem Bruder zog ein
neuer Bettgeher zu uns. Das ist der andere, von dem ich erz√§hlen mu√ü. Er
war schon ein √§lterer Mann, so zirka f√ºnfzig Jahre alt, was er
eigentlich f√ºr eine Besch√§ftigung hatte, wei√ü ich nicht. Er war viel zu
Hause, sa√ü in der K√ºche und plauderte mit der Mutter, und wenn alle
weggegangen waren, blieb ich oft mit ihm allein. Weil er einen gro√üen
Vollbart hatte, besch√§ftigte ich mich oft mit dem Gedanken, wie viel
Haare er wohl zwischen seinen F√º√üen haben mochte. Aber als ich ihm
einmal an einem Sonntag zusah, wie er sich in der K√ºche wusch und zu
meinem nicht geringen Staunen entnahm, wie seine ganze Brust mit Haaren
bedeckt war, f√ºrchtete ich mich einigerma√üen vor ihm, ohne da√ü jedoch
meine Neugierde sich verminderte.

Er war gleich von Anfang sehr freundlich zu mir, streichelte mich an den
Haaren, fa√üte mich unterm Kinn, und ich dr√ºckte mich schmeichelnd an
ihn, wenn ich ihn begr√º√üte. Wie wir nun wieder einmal allein waren,
wurde ich sehr geil, denn es fiel mir ein, da√ü man jetzt alles in Ruhe
machen k√∂nne. Ich ging zu Herrn Ekhard -- so hie√ü er -- in die K√ºche,
lie√ü mich wieder von ihm streicheln und fuhr ihm mit den H√§nden in den
Bart, was mich noch mehr in Aufregung brachte. Und wieder mu√ü etwas in
meinem Blick gewesen sein, etwas, was ihm die Besinnung raubte. Er
klopfte mir pl√∂tzlich mit dem Handr√ºcken auf mein Kleid, gerade an die
kritische Stelle. Ich stand vor ihm, er sa√ü auf einem Sessel, und so
klopfte er da unten bei mir an. Es konnte ganz zuf√§llig sein. H√§tte ich
nichts geahnt, w√§re es mir gar nicht aufgefallen. So aber l√§chelte ich
ihn an, und mein L√§cheln mochte wohl alles gesagt haben. Denn jetzt
griff er schon ein wenig fester zu, aber immer noch √ºber meinem Kleid.
Ich trat zwischen seine ge√∂ffneten Knie n√§her an ihn heran, wehrte ihn
nicht ab, sondern l√§chelte nur weiter. Da wurde er auf einmal ganz rot
im Gesicht, ri√ü mich an sich heran, k√º√üte mich st√ºrmisch, hob mir dabei
meinen Rock auf und spielte mit seinen Fingern an meiner Spalte. Aber
das war ein ganz anderes Spielen, als ich es bisher gekannt hatte. Ich
wu√üte gar nicht, ob er mit einem Finger oder mit allen f√ºnfen spielte,
mir war gleich als ob ich gev√∂gelt w√ºrde, als dr√§nge er tief in mich
ein, obwohl er's gar nicht tat und ich begann langsam zu wetzen, w√§hrend
ich an seiner Brust lehnte. Er fa√üte mich bei der Hand und f√ºhrte mich,
und gleich darauf hielt ich seinen Schweif. Der war so riesengro√ü, da√ü
ich ihn gar nicht umspannen konnte. Ich fuhr sofort an dieser gro√üen
gl√ºhenden Stange auf und ab, und er spielte mit mir und k√º√üte mich. So
rieben wir uns gegenseitig eine Weile, bis er zu spritzen anfing. Ich
f√ºhlte, wie meine Hand ganz warm √ºberrieselt wurde und h√∂rte die
schweren Tropfen auf dem Fu√üboden aufklatschen, und dabei kam es auch
mir, denn w√§hrend er spritzte, hatte er die Geschwindigkeit seiner
Finger verzehnfacht.

Wie alles vor√ºber war, sa√ü er ganz erschrocken da, dr√ºckte mich in seine
Arme und fl√ºsterte mir zu: ¬ªWirst du's niemandem sagen?¬´ Ich sch√ºttelte
den Kopf. Da k√º√üte er mich, stand auf und ging fort. Ein paar Tage lang
sah ich ihn nur fl√ºchtig. Er wich meinem Blick aus und schien sich vor
mir zu sch√§men. Das ber√ºhrte mich ganz sonderbar, so da√ü ich immer
davonlief, wenn er kam. Nach einer Woche aber, w√§hrend ich einmal mit
meinen Br√ºdern im Hof unten umherlief, -- die Mutter war nicht zu Hause
-- sah ich ihn kommen und die Stiege hinaufgehen. Eine Weile nachher
schlich ich hinterdrein. Das Herz klopfte mir, als ich die K√ºche betrat.
Er griff rasend nach mir, gierig, und seine H√§nde zitterten, wie ich gut
bemerkte. Ich warf mich in seine Arme und hatte sofort wieder den Genu√ü,
von seinen Fingern bedient zu werden. Wir sa√üen nebeneinander, und er
gab mir seinen Schweif. Heute konnte ich mir ihn genau betrachten. Er
war doppelt so lang und doppelt so dick wie der von Robert, und er war
ganz gebogen. Jetzt, wo ich manches Tausend dieser Liebesinstrumente in
meinen H√§nden wie auch sonst in allen L√∂chern meines Leibes gehabt habe,
kann ich nachtr√§glich feststellen, da√ü es ein ausnehmend sch√∂nes und
r√ºstiges Exemplar von einem Schweif gewesen ist, der mich noch ganz
anders erg√∂tzt h√§tte, w√§re ich nur damals um paar Jahre √§lter gewesen.
Ich wichste ihm ganz feurig einen herunter, und so gut ich's von Robert
gelernt hatte. Wenn ich aber inne hielt, sowie ich erm√ºdete, oder wenn
ich tiefer rutschte, um den weichen Haarbuschen, der aus seiner Hose
hervorquoll, n√§her zu betasten, fl√ºsterte er mir zu: ¬ªWeiter, mein
Engerl, mein Mauserl, mein s√º√ües Schatzerl, meine kleine Geliebte, ich
bitt' dich um Gottes willen, weiter, weiter¬†...¬´ Ich war √ºber diese
Namen, die er mir gab, ganz paff, bildete mir ungeheuer viel darauf ein
und arbeitete, um es ihm recht zu machen, so flei√üig weiter, da√ü sein
Samen bald hoch aufspritzte und mich beinahe ins Gesicht getroffen
h√§tte, weil ich dicht √ºber seinen Schwanz gebeugt war.

Ein paar Tage sp√§ter, als wir wieder im Begriffe waren, uns gegenseitig
einen herunterzurei√üen, sagte er mir wieder: ¬ªSchatzerl, Engerl,
Mauserl, Herzerl, Geliebte¬´, und auf einmal, ich streichelte seinen
Schweif gerade besonders gut, und dabei warf ich meinen Popo hin und
her, denn er bearbeitete meine Fut, da√ü es mir jeden Augenblick kommen
wollte, da fl√ºsterte er mir zu: ¬ªAch Gott, wenn ich dich nur v√∂geln
k√∂nnte¬†...¬´ Mit einem Ruck hatte ich mich von seiner Hand befreit, lie√ü
ihn los und warf mich zur Erde, breitete die F√º√üe auseinander und lag in
Erwartung da. Er kam zu mir, beugte sich herab und keuchte: ¬ªAber das
geht ja nicht, du bist ja noch zu klein¬†...¬´ -- ¬ªDas macht nichts, Herr
Ekhard¬´, sagte ich ihm, ¬ªkommen Sie nur.¬´ Er legt sich, halbtoll vor
Geilheit, auf mich, schob mir seine Hand unter den Popo, so da√ü er mich
aufheben konnte und rieb nun mit seinem Schwanz an meiner Fut. Ich hielt
ihn dabei am Schweif fest, und sorgte daf√ºr, da√ü er meine ganze Spalte
bestrich. Er stie√ü, so rasch er konnte, und fragte dabei: ¬ªHast du denn
schon einmal gev√∂gelt?¬´ Ich h√§tte ihm gerne alles erz√§hlt, von Franz und
Ferdl und von Robert, aber ich wei√ü nicht was mich dazu trieb, nein zu
sagen. Er fuhr fort: ¬ªGeh Engerl, sag mir, du hast schon gev√∂gelt, ich
merk' es ja, -- sag mir nur mit wem? Oft? War's gut?¬´ Ich arbeitete mit
meinem Popo und atmete schon schwer, denn er lag auf meiner Brust, und
ich f√ºhlte auch schon, wie sein Schweif schon zu zucken begann. Aber ich
log ganz frech weiter: ¬ªNein, g'wi√ü nicht ... heut zum erstenmal¬†...¬´ --
¬ªIst's gut¬†...?¬´ fragte er weiter. -- ¬ªJa, sehr gut¬†...¬´ In diesem
Augenblick flo√ü er √ºber und benetzte mir den Bauch, so da√ü mir die Suppe
an den Leisten herunterrann. ¬ªBleib so liegen¬´, meinte er und sprang
auf, zog sein Taschentuch und trocknete mich sauber ab.

Dann forschte er mich weiter aus: ¬ªDas gibt's nicht¬´, sagte er, ¬ªda√ü du
noch von gar nichts wei√üt, das erz√§hl mir nicht. Das kenn' ich schon.¬´
Und als ich weiter leugnete, meinte er: ¬ªWahrscheinlich hast du aber
einmal zug'schaut, was?¬´ Das schien mir ein Ausweg. Ich nickte
zustimmend. ¬ªWo denn?¬´ drang er weiter in mich. Ich deutete ins Zimmer.
¬ªAch ja, dem Vater und der Mutter?¬´ -- ¬ªJa.¬´ -- Jetzt wollte er mehr
wissen: ¬ªWie haben sie's denn gemacht?¬´ Und er gab nicht nach, bis ich
ihm alles erz√§hlte. Und w√§hrend ich sprach, hatte er mir wieder die
R√∂cke aufgehoben und spielte wieder an meiner Fut, so da√ü es mir noch
einmal kam.

Ich hatte es nun auch mit einem ¬ªGro√üen¬´ gemacht, wor√ºber ich nicht
wenig stolz war. Aber ich schwieg doch Franz gegen√ºber, und wenn wir
manchmal bei unseren Nachmittagsunterhaltungen davon sprachen, wie es
erst mit ¬ªGro√üen¬´ sein m√ºsse, lie√ü ich mir nichts merken und brachte das
Gespr√§ch immer auf die Frau Reinthaler, weil Franz sich alle M√ºhe gab,
dieser Frau vor die Augen zu gehen, und davon tr√§umte, ihr auch einmal
W√§sche auf den Boden tragen zu helfen.

Seit ich von Herrn Ekhard gev√∂gelt worden war, sah ich mich nach
erwachsenen M√§nnern noch mehr um, malte es mir von jedem aus, wie er
mich auf die Knie nehmen w√ºrde und freute mich, mit ganz andern Augen
nach ihnen zu blicken. Es kam auf der Stra√üe oft vor, da√ü M√§nner, die
ich angeschaut hatte, sich erstaunt nach mir umdrehten. Manche blieben
sogar stehen, und einer winkte mir, aber ich getraute mich nicht ihm zu
folgen, obwohl ich dann pl√∂tzlich geil wurde. Aber seit mir dieser eine
zugewinkt hatte, lief ich Nachmittags oft auf das F√ºrstenfeld, weil es
dort einsamer war und ich dort viel eher einen zweiten Herrn Ekhard zu
treffen hoffte. Einmal war ich l√§nger und auch weiter umherspaziert, und
es d√§mmerte bereits stark, als ich mich auf den R√ºckweg machte. Langsam
kam mir ein Soldat entgegen, und als er ganz nahe war, schaute ich ihm
l√§chelnd ins Gesicht. Er blickte mich betroffen an, ging aber weiter.
Ich sp√§hte rasch umher und sah, da√ü weit und breit niemand war. Dann
drehte ich mich um. Der Soldat war stehengeblieben und schaute mir nach.
Ich l√§chelte ihm zu und ging weiter. Nach einer Weile drehte ich mich
wieder um, und jetzt winkte er. Mein Herz klopfte, meine Fut brannte,
meine Neugierde war aufs H√∂chste erregt. Trotzdem hielt ich mich aus
Angst zur√ºck, und blieb nur stehen. Jetzt kam der Soldat ganz eilig zu
mir heran. Ich r√ºhrte mich nicht. Er beugte sich zu mir nieder und stie√ü
mit ernstem Gesicht heraus: ¬ªBist allein¬†...?¬´ -- Ich nickte mit dem
Kopf. ¬ªAlsdann komm¬´, fl√ºsterte er und schritt querfeldein auf ein
Geb√ºsch zu. Ich trottete hinter ihm her, zitternd vor Angst, doch
folgte ich ihm Schritt vor Schritt, ich konnte nicht anders. Kaum waren
wir hinter das Geb√ºsch getreten, als er mich ohne ein weiteres Wort zu
Boden warf und auch schon auf mir lag. Ich sp√ºrte seinen Schweif gegen
meine Fut sto√üen und griff mit der Hand dazwischen. Er aber dr√§ngte mich
fort und probierte nun seinerseits mit der Hand nachhelfend, ob er mir
nicht seine Nudel hineinstecken k√∂nne. Mir taten diese Versuche sehr
weh, aber ich muckte nicht. So wechselte die Sache ab. Einmal fuhr er
mir so √ºber meine Spalte hin, und das war mir angenehm, dann suchte er
wieder den Eingang und pre√üte dagegen an, und das verursachte mir
Schmerzen. Zuletzt wurde er ganz wild und wollte mit Gewalt
hineinkommen. Er lenkte sein Gescho√ü mit der einen Hand, mit der anderen
spreizte er meine Fut. Ich sp√ºrte seine Schwanzspitze schon in meinem
Loch sitzen, er bohrte, bohrte und bohrte, und ich glaubte, er werde
mich auseinandersprengen. Schon wollte ich aufschreien, so heftig
schmerzte mich die Sache, da spritzte er und √ºberschwemmte mich mit
seinem Samen. Gleich darauf sprang er auf, lie√ü mich liegen und ging
davon, ohne mich auch nur anzusehen. Als ich dann wieder hervorkam und
den Wiesenweg erreichte, sah ich ihn in der Ferne stehen und sein Wasser
lassen. Es dunkelte schon, und ich wollte eilig nach Hause. Kaum aber
war ich hundert Schritte gegangen, klopfte mir jemand auf die Schulter.
Erschrocken fuhr ich zusammen. Vor mir stand ein zerlumpter Junge, etwas
kleiner als ich, vielleicht auch etwas j√ºnger. ¬ªDu, was hast denn mit
dem Soldaten getan?¬´ fragte er mich. ¬ªNichts¬´, schrie ich ihn zornig an.
¬ªSo -- nichts --?¬´ lachte er h√∂hnisch. ¬ªIch hab's ganz gut g'sehn, was
du getan hast.¬´ Ich bekam Angst. ¬ªNichts hast du g'sehn, du Lausbub¬´,
fuhr ich ihn an, aber schon weinerlich, ¬ªmeiner Seel', ich hab' nichts
getan.¬´ Er fuhr mir mit der Hand zwischen die Beine: ¬ªDu Luder, du! Ich
hab's g'sehn, g'v√∂gelt hast im Gras dort, verstehst¬†...?¬´ Er stand
zornig da und puffte mich immerfort in die Fut. ¬ªWas willst denn von
mir?¬´ fragte ich ihn bittend, denn ich sah wohl ein, da√ü ich ihm das
Gesehene nicht ableugnen durfte. ¬ªWas ich will?¬´ Er trat ganz dicht zu
mir. ¬ªAuch v√∂geln will ich, verstehst?¬´ Jetzt gab ich ihm einen Sto√ü vor
die Brust: ¬ªSchau, da√ü d' weiterkommst.¬´ Aber pl√∂tzlich schlug er mir
eine Ohrfeige ins Gesicht, da√ü es nur so klatschte. ¬ªIch werd' dir
geben, sto√üen¬´, rief er. ¬ªMit ein' Soldaten m√∂chtest v√∂geln und mich
t√§tst sto√üen, was? Na wart nur, ich geh' dir bis z' Haus nach und sag's
deiner Mutter ... Ich kenn' dich schon.¬´ Mit einem Satz trat ich zur
Seite und rannte davon. Aber er holte mich ein, erwischte mich bei der
Schulter und wollte mich wieder schlagen. ¬ªKomm v√∂geln¬´, sagte ich jetzt
rasch. Ich gab es auf, ihm zu entrinnen. Wir traten hinter das Geb√ºsch,
legten uns ins Gras und er schob mir die Kleider in die H√∂he. Dann legte
er sich auf mich und sagte: ¬ªDen ganzen Nachmittag wart ich schon auf
ein M√§del zum V√∂geln.¬´ Er mochte sieben Jahre alt sein. ¬ªWie hast mich
denn g'sehn?¬´ fragte ich. ¬ªIch bin ja im Gras g'legen, wie der Soldat zu
dir herkommen ist, und dann bin ich euch nachgeschlichen.¬´ Er hatte
einen ganz kleinen spitzigen Schwanz, der mich nicht schlecht v√∂gelte,
so da√ü es mir auf einmal ganz recht war, ihm nachgegeben zu haben und
ich nicht begriff, warum ich mich geweigert hatte, ihn v√∂geln zu lassen.
Sein Zipfel war so klein und d√ºnn, wie ich noch keinen gesp√ºrt hatte und
mir kam die Idee, da√ü diesem Buben da gelingen k√∂nnte, was der Soldat
bei mir vergebens versucht hatte, n√§mlich zu mir hineinzukommen. Ich
erwischte ihn deshalb mit der Hand und f√ºhrte ihn, und offenbar weil ich
schon von dem dicken Schweif des Soldaten ein wenig angebohrt war, dann
auch weil noch von seinem Samen alles ganz na√ü und glitschrig in mir
war, rutschte er gleich ein ganzes St√ºck herein. Ich wetzte nun und
stemmte mich dagegen, und er kam wirklich beinahe vollst√§ndig in meine
Fut. Es tat mir doch ein wenig weh, aber dem Buben gefiel die Sache,
denn er remmelte wie ein Uhrwerk so rasch, und ich war viel zu stolz,
jetzt endlich wie eine wirkliche Frau gev√∂gelt zu werden, als da√ü ich
das nicht ausgehalten h√§tte. Es dauerte eine ganze Weile bis der Bub
fertig war. Er lief gleich davon, und ich ging endlich nach Hause. Der
Vater war mit der Mutter im Gasthaus, der Herr Ekhard lag in der K√ºche
im Bett, meine Br√ºder schliefen schon. Ich wollte bei Ekhard vorbei,
aber er rief mich leise an, so da√ü ich an sein Bett trat. Er zog meine
Hand unter die Decke und ich tastete nach seiner Nudel. Sie stand nach
wenigem Streicheln voll und steif in die H√∂he, und da er stets unter der
Decke nackt war, konnte ich seinen Hodensack, seine Schenkeln, kurz
alles genau bef√ºhlen. Ich wollte aber nicht, da√ü er mich anr√ºhren solle,
denn ich war noch ganz na√ü. Er aber fl√ºsterte mir zu: ¬ªWillst du nicht
v√∂geln?¬´ -- ¬ªNein¬´, sagte ich, ¬ªheute nicht¬´, ich wichste nun drauf los,
damit es ihm eher kommen solle. Er versuchte mit seiner Hand unter meine
Kleider zu geraten, ich entzog mich ihm. ¬ªWas ist denn?¬´ fragte er. ¬ªDie
Buben k√∂nnten's h√∂ren¬†...¬´, antwortete ich. Aber von dem Wichsen und von
dem Gef√ºhl, das sein hei√üer gro√üer Schwanz in meiner Hand erregte, war
ich wieder geil geworden, und ich dachte an nichts weiter mehr, als er
mich kraftvoll aufhob und mich auf seinen Schwanz setzte. Ich raffte nur
geschwind die Kleider in die H√∂he und rieb mich an dieser hei√üen und
dicken Stange. Herr Ekhard merkte gar nicht, da√ü ich na√ü war. ¬ªMein
Engerl¬´, sagte er, ¬ªmein Schatzerl¬´, und gerade als es mir so heftig
kam, da√ü ich am ganzen K√∂rper zuckte, spritzte er auch, und es war so
reichlich, da√ü ich die N√§sse noch die ganze Nacht auf dem Hemd sp√ºrte.
Es war ein ereignisreicher Tag f√ºr mich gewesen, fast so wie jener, an
dem uns Robert das richtige V√∂geln und Schlecken beigebracht hatte.

Franz sp√ºrte noch immer der Frau Reinthaler nach, und auch ich
beobachtete sie, wo ich nur konnte, um alles meinem Bruder erz√§hlen zu
k√∂nnen. Ich sah sie oft beim Haustor mit allerlei M√§nnern reden und
scherzen und glaubte jedesmal, da√ü diese M√§nner sie v√∂gelten. Besonders
oft bemerkte ich sie mit dem Herrn Horak, und die Folge zeigte, da√ü ich
wenigstens in diesem einen Falle recht vermutet hatte. Herr Horak war
ein Bierversilberer, der alle Tage mit einem gro√üen Bierwagen vor das
Haus gefahren kam und da F√§sser abladen und aufladen lie√ü. Im Keller
unseres Hauses war n√§mlich ein Bierdepot. Herr Horak war ein gro√üer
starker Mann, etwa drei√üig Jahre alt, ein athletischer Kerl mit einem
roten, feisten Gesicht, einem kleinen blonden Schnurrbart und einem
glattgeschnittenen Sch√§del. Er hatte auch ein goldenes Ohrringel, was
mir besonders an ihm gefiel. Mir schien damals √ºberhaupt, als ob Herr
Horak ein sch√∂ner und pr√§chtiger Mann sei. Er trug immer einen wei√üen
Piket-Janker oder einen grauen Sommeranzug, und immer hatte er eine
schwere silberne Uhrkette, an der ein schweres silbernes Pferd baumelte,
was meine besondere Bewunderung erregte. Als ich einmal aus der Schule
nach Hause kam, stand die Frau Reinthaler mit dem Herrn Horak beim Tor.
Sie hatte eine rote Bluse an, die nicht in ihrem Rock befestigt war,
sondern vorne ganz lose herunterhing. Geschn√ºrt war sie auch nicht, und
ich sah wie ihre starken Br√ºste voll hervorstanden, jede Brust einzeln
und seitw√§rts, und man konnte sogar die Brustwarzen durchsehen. Herr
Horak lehnte in seinem wei√üen Janker vor ihr, und sie lachten
miteinander. Eben als ich n√§herkam, haschte Herr Horak nach ihrer Brust,
und sie wehrte ihn ab, indem sie ihn auf die Hand schlug. Er rang ein
paar Sekunden mit ihr, fuhr ihr wieder nach der Brust und quetschte sie
ganz zusammen. Frau Reinthaler stie√ü ihn fort, und er b√ºckte sich und
tat so, als ob er ihr unter die R√∂cke fahren wollte. Sie kreischte laut
auf, hielt sich die H√§nde vor, und schlug auch wieder nach ihm, aber sie
war gar nicht b√∂se. Ich schlich unbemerkt um sie herum und beobachtete
sie. Denn dieses Treiben interessierte mich nat√ºrlich, und am liebsten
h√§tte ich mich dazugestellt und alles angeh√∂rt, was sie sprachen. Herr
Horak aber unternahm keinen Angriff mehr, sondern hatte offenbar ein
ernstes Gespr√§ch begonnen. Dann verschwand er im Haustor und gleich nach
ihm Frau Reinthaler. Ich huschte eilig nach und sah, wie die Frau
Reinthaler in den Keller ging. Eine Weile wartete ich, dann stieg ich
ganz leise die Kellertreppe hinunter. Ich kannte mich aus und gewann
eine Mauerecke, in der ich Posto fa√üte. Von da aus konnte ich in den
langen Gang blicken, der vor mir lag, und an dessen Ende der Kellerraum
war, der von einer Luke sein Licht empfing und die Bierf√§sser enthielt.
Frau Reinthaler und Herr Horak standen gerade in der Mitte und hielten
sich umarmt und k√º√üten sich, und dabei hatte er ihr die Bluse
aufgehoben, ihr ins Hemd gegriffen und hielt jetzt ihren Busen in der
Hand. Es war eine volle, milchwei√üe runde Brust, auf der die gro√üen
roten H√§nde des Herrn Horak jetzt herumdr√ºckten und patschten. Die Frau
Reinthaler aber stand ganz an ihn geschmiegt, und w√§hrend sie sich von
ihm k√ºssen lie√ü, sah ich, wie sie ihm das Hosent√ºrl aufkn√∂pfte. Wie dann
aber sein Schwanz in ihre Hand kam, fing sie zu zittern an und lehnte
sich noch fester an ihn. Es war ein unglaublich langer, d√ºnner Schweif
und auffallend wei√ü. Er war so lang, da√ü man die Hand der Frau
Reinthaler gar nicht bemerkte, so hoch schaute er dr√ºber heraus, und sie
brauchte schon eine h√ºbsche Weile, wenn sie ihn auf und nieder in seiner
ganzen L√§nge abreiben wollte. Aber da√ü er gar so d√ºnn war, erstaunte
mich. Herr Horak, der so laut schnaufte, da√ü ich ihn bis zu mir h√∂ren
konnte, dr√§ngte nun die Frau gegen ein hohes Fa√ü, nahm ihr noch die
zweite Brust aus dem Hemd und streichelte und pre√üte beide, und Frau
Reinthaler lehnte sich gegen die Wand, und ich h√∂rte, wie sie leise
sagte: ¬ªGehn S' kommen S' schon, ich halt's nicht mehr aus.¬´ Ich war
neugierig, wie sie es machen werden, denn diese Stellung hatte ich noch
nicht gesehen. Herr Horak, dem sein langer d√ºnner Schweif bis zum
baumelnden Silberpferd hinaufstand, nahm die Beine der Frau √ºber seine
Arme, und so dr√ºckte er ihr ihn stehend hinein, w√§hrend sie auf dem Fa√ü
sitzen blieb und mit dem R√ºcken gegen die Wand lehnte. ¬ªJesus, Maria und
Josef¬´, schrie die Reinthaler leise auf, als sie den Stachel zu f√ºhlen
bekam. ¬ªJesus, Maria, Sie sto√üen mir ja den Magen ein¬†...¬´ Horak
v√∂gelte rasch und mit aller Kraft, und sein Kopf war gesenkt dabei, so
da√ü er die blo√üen Br√ºste der Frau betrachtete. Es war, als ob er sie
durch und durch spalten wolle, so heftig fuhr er in sie hinein und
heraus, und sie k√º√üte ihn bald auf das glattgeschorene Haar, bald pre√üte
sie seinen Kopf zwischen ihre Br√ºste, bald wieder redete sie zu ihm oder
keuchte auf vor Entz√ºcken: ¬ªAh¬†..., ah¬†..., das halt' ich nicht aus, ...
mir kommt's ja alle Augenblick¬†..., jetzt¬†..., jetzt¬†..., jetzt¬†..., so
-- jetzt ist mir's wieder 'kommen¬†..., ah, das ist gut¬†..., gehn S'
halten S' noch zur√ºck¬†..., noch nicht spritzen¬†..., Jesus, Maria¬†...,
wenn mein Mann so v√∂geln k√∂nnt'¬†..., ah¬†..., das ist gut¬†..., so hat's
mir noch keiner gemacht¬†..., ah¬†..., das g'sp√ºr' ich bis in Mund
herauf¬†..., ah¬†..., wenn ich das g'wu√üt h√§tt', wie Sie's k√∂nnen, dann
h√§tt' ich's schon lang hergegeben ... Noch mehr¬†..., Herrgott¬†..., da
w√§r' man ja der reine Narr, wenn man so an Mann nicht dr√ºberlasset¬†...,
ah es kommt mir schon wieder¬†..., fester¬†..., fester¬†..., so ist
gut¬†..., gehn S' Herr Horak¬†..., einmal m√ºssen wir aber als nackender
v√∂geln¬†..., was¬†...? Als nackender¬†..., ja¬†...? Im Hotel¬†..., ja¬†...?¬´
Er gab keine Antwort, sondern stie√ü ihr nur immer seinen Schwanz in den
Leib, da√ü es ihr jedesmal einen Ruck gab. Sie begann zu schnappen, zu
keuchen, zu r√∂cheln und stie√ü zuletzt ein leises Geheul aus, das wie ein
Weinen klang. Ihr Atem ging pfeifend, sie warf sich ganz zur√ºck, so da√ü
jetzt ihr Popo in der Luft schwebte, √ºber das Fa√ü hervorragend. Er hielt
sie an den Hinterbacken fest und bohrte sich in sie ein, und keuchte nur
einmal: ¬ªJetzt.¬´ Damit rannte er ihr ihn noch einmal so tief in den
Leib, da√ü sie laut aufbr√ºllte vor Wonne. Dann r√ºhrte er sich nicht
mehr; und nach einer Weile zog er seinen Schweif langsam heraus und gab
sie frei. Frau Reinthaler richtete sich auf, ordnete ihr Haar, und dann
fiel sie dem Herrn Horak um den Hals und k√º√üte ihn. ¬ªH√∂ren S'¬´, sagte
sie, ¬ªso kann's aber wohl der zehnte nicht. Das hab' ich mein Lebtag
noch nicht g'sehn¬†...¬´ Er z√ºndete sich eine Zigarette an und fragte:
¬ªWie oft ist's dir denn gekommen?¬´ -- ¬ªIch wei√ü gar nicht¬´, meinte sie,
¬ªf√ºnfmal wenigstens.¬´ Er nahm wieder ihre Br√ºste, wog sie in den H√§nden,
streichelte sie und zupfte an den Brustwarzen. Sie stand jetzt vor ihm.
¬ªWie oft kommt's dir denn, wenn dein Mann dich v√∂gelt¬†...?¬´ fragte er
l√§chelnd. Sie tat sehr entr√ºstet und ver√§chtlich: ¬ªGar nicht kommt's
mir. Mein Mann, der versteht's ja nicht. Wissen S', der kann's gar nicht
halten. Der legt sich drauf, steckt die Nudel hinein und spritzt gleich.
Das mu√ü mich nur reizen. Ich bin immer so geil, wenn er mich gev√∂gelt
hat, da√ü ich mir's dann mit der Hand machen mu√ü.¬´ Horak lachte laut und
fuhr fort, mit ihren Br√ºsten zu spielen. ¬ªWarum sagst ihm denn das
nicht¬†...?¬´ -- ¬ªAh, das nutzt nix. Wie oft streiten wir dar√ºber. Er will
mir immer einreden, da√ü alle M√§nner so v√∂geln und da√ü es gar nix anderes
gibt. Er wei√ü ja nicht, da√ü ich mir manchmal an andern Schweif hol'.¬´
Horak lachte auf, und sie redete weiter: ¬ªGlauben S', oft schon hab' ich
mir denkt, es mu√ü gehn mit ihm. Wenn er die zweite Nummer macht, braucht
er l√§nger, und da kann ich mir's kommen lassen. Na, aber er will ihm ja
das zweitemal gar nicht stehen. Manchmal, wenn ich ihm dann fest
auseinand wuzeln und in' Mund nehmen tu¬†...¬´, sie hielt inne. ¬ªJa, ja¬´
wiederholte sie dann, ¬ªzu so was bringt einen so ein Mann. Ich kann mir
nicht helfen. Nur damit er wieder steht, hab' ich ihn ein paarmal in
Mund g'nommen. Aber Schnecken. Wie er endlich wieder g'standen ist und
ich mir ihn g'schwind wieder hineingesteckt hab, pumps, gleich is er
losgegangen und ich hab' wieder die ganze Aufregung umsonst gehabt.¬´

Horak war aufgestanden: ¬ªDas mu√üt mir zeigen¬´, sagte er, ¬ªwie das is, in
den Mund v√∂geln. Das kenn' ich noch gar nicht.¬´ Er hielt sie immer noch
an ihren vollen wei√üen Br√ºsten fest, die mir sehr gut gefielen.

¬ªAber nein, Herr Horak¬´, sagte sie, ¬ªdas werden Sie schon sehr gut
kennen. Ihnen werden 's die Weiber doch oft genug getan haben. Sie
k√∂nnen doch eine jede haben, die was Sie wollen.¬´

Ich war in meinem Versteck ganz ihrer Meinung, denn ich h√§tte mir gerne
alles m√∂gliche von Herrn Horak tun lassen, und h√§tte ihm auch gerne
alles getan.

¬ªNein¬´, sagte er, ¬ªich hab' noch keine in den Mund gev√∂gelt. Gehn S'
her, zeigen S' mir das.¬´

Er dr√ºckte sie wieder, ohne ihre Brust loszulassen, gegen das Fa√ü. Sie
setzte sich, und er stand vor ihr.

¬ªAber bei Ihnen ist das doch nicht notwendig¬´, meinte sie. ¬ªIhnen steht
er doch so auch.¬´

¬ªGar nicht steht er mir¬´, rief er, zog seinen Schweif heraus, der
wirklich ganz weich und lang herabhing.

Sie griff danach, nudelte ihn mit den H√§nden, und er zupfte sie wieder
an den Brustwarzen.

¬ªH√∂ren S', Sie regen mich ja wieder frisch auf¬´, meinte sie. ¬ªIch hab'
keine Zeit mehr, ich mu√ü gehen.¬´

Er pre√üte ihre Brust, da√ü das wei√üe Fleisch zwischen seinen roten
Fingern durchquoll. Pl√∂tzlich b√ºckte sie sich, hob seinen Schwanz auf
und hatte ihn auch schon in den Mund gesteckt. Er lie√ü ihre Brust los
und keuchte. Jetzt war er es, der: ¬ªMaria und Josef¬´ st√∂hnte.

In diesem Moment h√∂rte ich wie jemand die Kellertreppe herabschritt.
Unwillk√ºrlich rief ich ihnen zu: ¬ªEs kommt wer.¬´

Wie vom Schlag ger√ºhrt, schreckten sie zusammen und starrten auf mich.
Beide waren ganz bewegungslos. Sie mit ihren nackten Br√ºsten und er mit
seinem hochaufgeb√§umten Stachel. Er war der erste, der mit einem Ruck
den Schwanz in der Hose verschwinden lie√ü, die Kn√∂pfe schlo√ü und dann
eilig der Frau Reinthaler half, mit der Bluse ihre Brust zu verdecken.

Ich war ganz nah zu ihnen gegangen, schon weil auch ich Angst vor dem
unbekannten Jemand hatte, der in den Keller kam. Wir standen alle, ohne
ein Wort zu sagen, und die beiden starrten mich immer nur entsetzt und
besch√§mt an. Die Schritte n√§herten sich. Der Hausmeister kam vor√ºber,
sah uns drei da stehen, gr√º√üte Herrn Horak, nahm einen Besen und stieg
die Treppe wieder hinauf.

Jetzt waren wir allein. Frau Reinthaler schlug die H√§nde vor die Augen
und tat, als ob sie sich vor mir, wer wei√ü wie, sch√§men w√ºrde, und Herr
Horak war im Ernst so verlegen, da√ü er zur Wand schaute und sich nicht
traute, das Gesicht nach mir hinzukehren. Wie nun die Frau Reinthaler
merkte, da√ü Horak nicht mit mir reden k√∂nne und da√ü ich Miene machte,
davonzugehen, st√ºrzte sie auf mich zu und fl√ºsterte nur ganz nahe bei
mir ins Ohr: ¬ªHast d'was g'sehn?¬´ wollte sie wissen. Ich gab ihr sofort
Bescheid: ¬ªNa -- das!¬´ -- ¬ªWas ... das: Du hast gar nix g'sehn¬†...¬´ Aber
ich widersprach ihr: ¬ªO ja ... ich hab' alles g'sehn, was Sie mit'n
Herrn Horak g'macht haben.¬´ W√§hrend ich das sagte, bekam ich Angst vor
meiner Keckheit und wollte fort. Doch sie hielt mich an meinem
Handgelenk fest, und die beiden starrten einander ratlos an. Hierauf
griff Herr Horak in die Tasche, gab mir einen Silbergulden, und ohne
mich anzusehen, sagte er kleinlaut: ¬ªDa hast ... aber sag kein' Menschen
was¬†..., verstehst?¬´ Ich war √ºbergl√ºcklich, denn so was hatte ich nicht
erwartet, weil ich gefa√üt darauf war, Pr√ºgel zu erhalten und mich doch
die ganze Zeit davor ge√§ngstigt hatte. Jetzt schwand meine Angst auf
einmal, weil ich erkannte, da√ü die beiden sich vor mir f√ºrchteten. Ich
lachte auf, sagte zu Herrn Horak ¬ªK√º√ü' die Hand¬´ und wollte davon. Die
Reinthaler aber rief mich zur√ºck. ¬ªGeh, wart noch ein bisserl¬´, sagte
sie freundlich. Ich blieb stehen, und sie eilte auf Horak zu, zog ihn
weiter von mir fort in eine Ecke und fl√ºsterte aufgeregt mit ihm. Ich
sah beide aufmerksam an. Horak bekam ein ganz rotes Gesicht, sch√ºttelte
den Kopf, aber sie brach ab, wandte sich zu mir und winkte mir: ¬ªGeh her
da, Kleine.¬´ Als ich zu ihr kam, beugte sie sich zu mir, legte ihren Arm
um meinen Hals und schmeichelte: ¬ªAlsdann, sag mir jetzt, was hast denn
g'sehn¬†...?¬´ Ich antwortete nicht, jedoch sie lie√ü nicht ab von mir:
¬ªSag's nur, wenn du's wei√üt¬†...¬´ Ich schwieg; sie aber drang in mich:
¬ªSiehst du¬†..., jetzt wei√üt du's gar nicht einmal, weil du halt nichts
g'sehn hast¬†...¬´ Es entschl√ºpfte mir: ¬ªO ja¬†..., alles hab' ich g'sehn.¬´
-- ¬ªNa, so sag's doch, sag's doch¬†..., genier dich nicht vor Herrn
Horak¬†..., so red doch¬†..., wenn du's sagst ... schenkt dir der Herr
Horak was¬†..., oder er zeigt dir nachher was¬†..., na?¬´

Ich vermochte es aber doch nicht, vor dem Horak zu sprechen, sondern
dr√§ngte mich gegen die Brust der Frau Reinthaler und fl√ºsterte ihr ins
Ohr: ¬ªZuerst sind Sie auf dem Fa√ül da g'sessen¬†...¬´

¬ªNa und¬†...?¬´

¬ª...¬†und der Herr Horak war zwischen Ihren F√º√üen¬†...¬´

Sie zog mich st√§rker an sich: ¬ª...¬†und weiter¬†...?¬´

Ich fa√üte eine ihrer Br√ºste und deutete an, wie Horak damit gespielt
hatte ...

Sie aber hauchte weiter: ¬ªNa und was noch¬†...?¬´

Ich legte meine Lippen an ihr Ohr: ¬ª...¬†und dann ham Sie das vom Herrn
Horak in' Mund g'nommen¬†...¬´

Sie wiegte mich in ihren Armen und fragte in singendem Ton, wie zu einem
kleinen Kind sprechend: ¬ªNa, und wei√üt du vielleicht¬†..., wie man das
hei√üt¬†...?¬´

Herr Horak war n√§her gekommen und stand vor uns. Ich l√§chelte ihn an und
sah, wie Frau Reinthaler ihm zublinzelte: ¬ªWei√üt du, wie man das hei√üt
--?¬´

Ich wollte nun vor ihm zeigen, da√ü ich nicht so dumm sei und sagte ja.

Frau Reinthaler wiegte mich weiter und bat: ¬ªNa, so sag's, mein
Mauserl¬†..., geh¬†..., sag's doch¬†...¬´

Ich schmiegte mich an sie, weigerte mich aber und sch√ºttelte den Kopf:
¬ªNein, ich sag's nicht¬†...¬´

Jetzt griff sie vor mir an das Hosent√ºrl des Herrn Horak. Ich schaute
ihr gespannt zu, wie sie seinen Schweif herausnahm, der kerzengrad und
steif in die H√∂he stand. ¬ªSag's doch¬†..., sag's doch¬†...¬´

Sie streichelte den Schweif, setzte mich auf ihren Knien frei auf und
sagte: ¬ªNa so sag's doch, wenn du's wei√üt¬†...¬´

Wie ich aber weiter schwieg, nahm sie meine Hand und legte sie Herrn
Horak an die Nudel. Ich lie√ü mich willig f√ºhren, und wie ich jetzt
seinen langen Stachel anr√ºhrte, l√§chelte ich vergn√ºgt und schaute dem
Horak in das rote Gesicht. Dann begann ich ihn leise, leise zu reiben,
hinauf und hinunter und sah, wie ihm die Knie zitterten. Frau Reinthaler
bog mit gelinder Kraft meinen Kopf der Schwanzspitze entgegen. Die
Eichel war ganz dicht vor meinem Mund und in meiner Hand f√ºhlte ich, wie
heftig der Schweif des Horak pulsierte. Ich konnte nicht widerstehen,
√∂ffnete die Lippen und lie√ü diese sch√∂ne wei√üe Nudel bis an meinen
Gaumen eindringen, fuhr langsam zur√ºck und wieder vor und seufzte, wie
ich es bei Robert gelernt hatte. Ich f√ºhlte die roten gro√üen H√§nde
Horaks √ºber mein Gesicht gleiten. Dann fuhr er abw√§rts und suchte, ob
ich nicht einen Busen habe. Wie er aber dort nichts fand, nahm er die
Br√ºste, die ihm Frau Reinthaler √ºber meinem Kopf hin vorhielt. Sie
selbst fuhr mir von hinten unter die R√∂cke und fingerte mir an meiner
Spalte, so gut, da√ü mir H√∂ren und Sehen verging und ich schneller und
schneller mir den Schwanz in den Mund stie√ü. Freilich nur das oberste
St√ºck, denn er war viel zu lang, als da√ü ich nur ein Viertel h√§tte
aufnehmen k√∂nnen.

Frau Reinthaler sagte, w√§hrend sie in meiner Fut Klavier spielte,
keuchend zu Horak: ¬ªNicht spritzen¬†..., ich m√∂chte auch noch was haben.¬´
Da zog er mir seine Nudel aus dem Mund. Frau Reinthaler lie√ü mich von
ihrem Scho√ü herabgleiten und schon hatte sie ihn zwischen ihre Beine
genommen, w√§hrend er tief in ihr Loch eindrang. Sie seufzte laut auf,
wandte ihren Kopf zu mir, die ich daneben stand und fragte jappend:
¬ªDu¬†..., ah ah¬†..., wei√üt¬†..., wie¬†..., ah ah¬†..., wie man das
hei√üt¬†...?¬´

¬ªV√∂geln¬´, sagte ich.

Und von der Seite her griff mir jetzt Horak unter die R√∂cke. Ich kam
ihm entgegen, und w√§hrend er die Frau Reinthaler bearbeitete, kniff und
dr√ºckte er mich mit seinen gro√üen roten H√§nden an meiner Spalte, rieb
seine Finger einen nach dem anderen daran und suchte, ob mein Loch schon
offen sei. Ein bi√üchen drang er auch auf dem Weg vor, den der Bub hinter
dem Geb√ºsch damals gebahnt hatte. Ich hielt ihn mit meiner Hand fest und
lie√ü mich von seinem Zeigefinger v√∂geln, und die Beine zitterten mir vor
Wonne, denn das Seufzen, Keuchen und Sprechen der Frau Reinthaler, ihre
nackten Br√ºste, die an den roten Warzen ganz feucht schimmerten, das
schwere Schnaufen von Horak, regten mich noch mehr auf, als ich es von
dem langen Zuschauen ohnehin schon war.

Als wir dann fertig waren, sagte Horak, w√§hrend er sich die Hose
zukn√∂pfte: ¬ªDas M√§del ist aber schon wie eine Ausg'lernte¬†...¬´

Frau Reinthaler l√§chelte mich an und meinte: ¬ªNat√ºrlich, ich hab's
sowieso gleich erkannt. Ein kleines Menscherl ist sie.¬´

Und zu mir gewendet fragte sie: ¬ªWie oft hast denn du schon
g'v√∂gelt¬†...?¬´

Ich leugnete nat√ºrlich: ¬ªGar nicht ... aber meiner Seel' gar nicht¬†...¬´

¬ªGeh weiter.¬´ Sie glaubte mir nicht. ¬ªDas darfst nicht sagen. Wie oft
hast du's 'tan? Aber l√ºg nicht.¬´

Doch ich blieb dabei: ¬ªGar nicht¬†..., nur zug'schaut hab' ich manchmal
zu Haus, in der Nacht¬†...¬´ Die Geschichte, die ich schon Ekhard erz√§hlt
hatte, kam mir auch hier zustatten.

Wir gingen zusammen die Treppen hinauf, Frau Reinthaler und ich. Herr
Horak war noch im Keller geblieben. Sie kam mir jetzt wie eine Freundin
und Kollegin vor, und ich war nicht wenig stolz auf sie und auf mich.
Das war doch noch was anderes, als die Anna und die Mizzi. Mir fiel der
Ferdl ein und da√ü er die Frau Reinthaler am Boden oben gev√∂gelt hatte.
Ferdl hatte auch mich so oft gev√∂gelt und das war wieder ein
Zusammenhang zwischen mir und ihr. Ich hielt es nicht mehr aus zu
schweigen. Schmeichelnd hing ich mich in sie ein, w√§hrend wir die
Treppen hinaufstiegen und sagte: ¬ªFrau Reinthaler¬†..., das ist ja nicht
wahr gewesen, was ich fr√ºher g'sagt hab'¬†...¬´

¬ªWas meinst du denn?¬´ fragte sie.

¬ªNa, da√ü ich's noch nicht getan hab'¬†...¬´

Sie antwortete mir mit lautem Interesse: ¬ªAlso hast du's schon getan?¬´

¬ªJa.¬´

¬ªDas hab ich mir gleich gedacht. Oft?¬´

¬ªJa.¬´

¬ªWie oft denn?¬´

¬ªVielleicht zehnmal oder noch √∂fter¬†...¬´

¬ªMit wem denn?¬´

Jetzt spielte ich meinen Trumpf aus: ¬ªMit dem Ferdl.¬´

Sie sagte gleichg√ºltig: ¬ªMit was f√ºr einem Ferdl?¬´

¬ªNa mit dem gro√üen Buben¬´, erkl√§rte ich ihr, ¬ªder da im Haus g'wohnt
hat, der Anna ihr Bruder. Sie hab'n ihn ja gekannt.¬´

¬ªIch?¬´ Sie stellte sich erstaunt. ¬ªIch hab' ihn nicht gekannt¬†...¬´

Das entt√§uschte mich freilich, und ich bestand darauf: ¬ªAber ja, Sie
haben ihn gewi√ü gekannt¬†...¬´

Sie sah mich von der Seite her an: ¬ªIch kann mich nicht erinnern¬†...¬´

Jetzt sagte ich's: ¬ªWissen S' nicht mehr? Er hat Ihnen einmal geholfen,
W√§sch' am Boden tragen¬†...¬´

Sie fuhr merklich zusammen. Dann sagte sie: ¬ªSo? Mir scheint ja¬†..., ich
wei√ü jetzt schon¬†...¬´

Ich lie√ü nicht los, dr√ºckte ihren Arm und fl√ºsterte: ¬ªFrau Reinthaler,
der Ferdl hat mir was g'sagt¬†...¬´

Sie unterbrach mich: ¬ªHalt's Maul¬´, und damit war die Sache beendigt.

Ein paar Tage sp√§ter traf ich den Herrn Horak, wie er eben in den Keller
ging. Ich gr√º√üte ihn laut ¬ªK√ºss' die Hand¬´, um seine Aufmerksamkeit zu
erregen. Er drehte sich in der Kellert√ºre um, erblickte mich, kam zur√ºck
und sp√§hte weiter, ob niemand da sei. Als er sich dessen vergewissert
hatte, rief er mich: ¬ªKomm mit in' Keller¬†..., magst?¬´ Ich war gleich
dabei. Im Keller unten blieb er im finsteren Gang stehen, fa√üte mich
beim Kopf und dr√ºckte mich gegen seine Hose. Ich ergriff seinen Schweif
mit beiden H√§nden und rieb ihn ab, und er sagte: ¬ªAh, du kannst es aber
so viel gut¬†..., was ist denn das?¬´ Ich gab keine Antwort, sondern
beeiferte mich, das Lob, das er mir spendete, zu verdienen; ich wurde
erfinderisch. Ich fuhr in seine Hose und streichelte seine Eier, und ich
zog mit der andern Hand seine Vorhaut √ºber die Eichel und wieder zur√ºck.

¬ªNimm's in' Mund¬´, bat er mich leise. Ich wollte nicht; warum wei√ü ich
selbst nicht, aber ich glaube, ich h√§tte seine lange Stange lieber
anders wohin genommen.

¬ªIch geb' dir einen Gulden¬´, versprach er, ¬ªwenn du ihn wieder in' Mund
nimmst.¬´

Aber ich schlug sein Anerbieten aus: ¬ªMachen S' mir's so wie der Frau
Reinthaler¬´, schlug ich ihm vor.

¬ªWas? Ich soll dich v√∂geln?¬´

¬ªJa.¬´

¬ªAber. Kinderl, da bist du ja noch zu klein dazu.¬´ Er war ganz erstaunt.

Ich hielt ihn am Schweif fest, wichste dann herum und rieb meine Fut an
seinem Knie. ¬ªO nein¬´, bestritt ich, ¬ªich bin nicht zu klein. Sie k√∂nnen
mich schon v√∂geln.¬´

¬ªAber du hast ja noch gar keine Haare drauf¬´, meinte er wieder.

¬ªDas macht nichts.¬´ Ich wollte von ihm gev√∂gelt sein, und ich gab nicht
nach.

¬ªJa, hast du's vielleicht schon einmal getan?¬´

¬ªNa und wie oft schon¬†...¬´

Er ri√ü mich zu sich empor, so da√ü ich rittlings auf seiner H√ºfte sa√ü,
Brust an Brust mit ihm, wie man kleine Kinder tr√§gt. Mit der einen Hand
hielt er mich, und ich schlang die Arme um seinen Hals. Mit der andern
Hand w√ºhlte er meine Kleider zur√ºck, spreizte mit den Fingern meine
Spalte, und ich f√ºhlte, wie er mit der Spitze seines Schwanzes an meinem
Eingang bohrte. Ich tanzte mit dem Popo auf und nieder, um ihn besser zu
sp√ºren und ihn tiefer hinein zu bekommen.

Er hielt sein Gesicht gegen das meinige, stie√ü unten, was er konnte,
aber nach einer Weile sagte er doch: ¬ªNein, nein, das geht nicht. Wart,
vielleicht ist's so besser¬†...¬´ Er stellte mich auf den Boden, und ich
sah, wie rotgerieben sein Schwanz war. Er setzte sich auf ein niederes
Fa√ü, rollte ein noch kleineres dicht heran, dann drehte er mich um, so
da√ü ich mit dem R√ºcken zu ihm stand. Nun glaubte ich, er werde mich so
traktieren, wie Robert es damals im Bett getan hatte und freute mich
darauf.

¬ªB√ºck dich!¬´ befahl er mir, ich tat es und lag nun mit den Ellbogen auf
das kleine Fa√ü gest√ºtzt. Mein Popo stand in die H√∂he. Wie ich mich
umschaute, bemerkte ich, da√ü Herr Horak seinen Schwanz mit Speichel
befeuchtete. Er sagte: ¬ªDas ist nur, damit's leichter geht¬†...¬´

Dann entbl√∂√üte er meinen Hintern und aufstehend beugte er sich √ºber
mich, da√ü er genau in meiner Stellung √ºber mir war. Voll Staunen, Angst
und Entsetzen nahm ich wahr, da√ü er seinen Schweif an meinen After
ansetzte und langsam zu bohren anfing. Ich wollte schreien, aber er
fl√ºsterte mir zu: ¬ªSei stad und wenn's dir weh tut, dann sag's.¬´ Damit
griff er aber auch nach vorn zwischen meine Beine und begann, w√§hrend er
sich mit dem Schwanz in mein Popoloch vorsichtig einw√ºhlte, mit den
Fingern an meiner Fut vortrefflich zu spielen.

¬ªTut's weh?¬´ fragte er.

Es tat mir schon ein bi√üchen weh, zugleich aber taten mir seine Finger
wohl, und so sagte ich: ¬ªNein.¬´

Er bohrte mit einem kleinen Ruck tiefer: ¬ªTut's weh?¬´

Es schmerzte, aber ich war von seinem H√§ndespiel so eingenommen, da√ü ich
ihn nicht fortlassen wollte und sagte: ¬ªNein, gar nicht.¬´

Jetzt gab er einen st√§rkern Ruck, und ich glaubte nun, da√ü mir sein
ganzer Schweif im Leibe sitze. Es war aber, wie er mir nachher sagte,
nur sein halber Schweif gewesen. Immerhin genug f√ºr mein Alter, f√ºr den
Ort, an dem er sich befand und f√ºr seine Riesenl√§nge. Bisher hatte ich
mich doch auch furchtbar davor geekelt, da√ü mein Arsch jetzt so
angebohrt wurde. Wie er aber mit dem letzten Ruck so weit eindrang,
sp√ºrte ich ein eigent√ºmliches Wonnegef√ºhl, zum Teil schmerzhaft, aber
doch nicht eigentlich so, da√ü es weh tat, sondern es war mehr die Angst
vor einem Schmerz, und es war auch nicht geradezu Wonne, sondern mehr
das Vorgef√ºhl einer solchen, aber so aufreizend und heftig, da√ü ich
st√∂hnen mu√üte.

Gleich fragte mich Horak: ¬ªTut's dir weh¬†...?¬´

Ich konnte nicht antworten, weil ich zu aufgeregt war.

Aber er zog seinen Schweif heraus und fragte noch einmal dringend:
¬ªTut's dir weh?¬´

Mir war seine Entfernung unangenehm. So hob ich den Popo, indem ich mich
auf die Zehenspitzen stellte, noch mehr und fl√ºsterte: ¬ªLassen S' ihn
nur drin¬†..., nur weiter v√∂geln¬†...¬´

Augenblicklich rutschte der warme Stiel wieder in mich hinein, und
erregt fl√ºsterte ich: ¬ª...¬†nur weiter v√∂geln¬†..., ah¬†..., so¬†..., so¬†...¬´

Er stie√ü nicht etwa kr√§ftig zu, sondern strich ganz sanft hin und her
und spielte dabei, mich an der Mitte umfassend, mit meiner Spalte, so
da√ü ich nach einer Weile glaubte, er sei ganz fest in meiner Fut drin.
Sonderbarerweise mu√üte ich an den Buben denken, der mich drau√üen auf dem
Feld gev√∂gelt hatte, an Robert, der mir ja auch ein bi√üchen
hineingekommen war, an den Herrn Ekhard, und diese Erinnerungen trugen
nur dazu bei, mich aufs H√∂chste zu erregen und geil zu machen.

Um den Schwanz, der mir hinten im Leibe sa√ü, besser zu sp√ºren, kniff ich
ein paarmal die Arschbacken zusammen, was auf Herrn Horak eine gro√üe
Wirkung √ºbte. Er wetzte rascher aus und ein, beugte sich tiefer √ºber
mich und begann mir ins Ohr zu zischeln: ¬ªJa, mein Herzerl¬†..., schnapp
nur¬†..., ja, mein Mauserl¬†..., ah¬†..., das ist¬†..., das ist aber¬†...,
sehr gut¬†..., h√∂rst ... Du bist eine s√º√üe kleine Hur¬†..., du g'fallst
mir¬†..., jeden Tag kommst jetzt in Keller zu mir¬†..., wei√üt?¬´

¬ªJeden Tag?¬´ fragte ich geil und zwickte ihn st√§rker mit den Arschbacken
in den Schwanz.

Er zuckte und fl√ºsterte hei√ü: ¬ªJawohl ... du Hur, du kleine¬†..., du
Mauserl du¬†..., jeden Tag m√∂cht' ich dich wetzen¬†..., ah, ah¬†...¬´

Mir gefiel das Gespr√§ch, es regte mich noch mehr auf und so gab ich
zur√ºck: ¬ªAlle Tag' wolln Sie mich v√∂geln, Herr Horak? Das geht ja
nicht¬†...?¬´

¬ªWarum denn nicht¬†...?¬´ Er stie√ü jetzt schon kr√§ftiger.

¬ªAber¬´, meinte ich, ¬ªwenn die Frau Reinthaler kommt¬†...¬´

¬ªAh was¬´, fl√ºsterte er, ¬ªdu mit deinem kleinen Loch und mit deiner
nackten Fut bist mir viel lieber¬†...¬´

¬ªDas glaub ich nicht¬†...¬´

¬ªWenn ich's sag.¬´ Er rieb sich jetzt so tief in mich hinein, da√ü ich
seinen Hodensack gegen meine Schenkel leise anschlagen sp√ºrte.

¬ªAber die Frau Reinthaler¬´, erinnerte ich ihn, ¬ªdie hat so sch√∂ne
Duteln¬†...¬´

¬ªIch pfeif drauf¬´, zischelte er. ¬ªDu wirst sowieso bald auch Duteln
kriegen.¬´

¬ªO nein, noch lange nicht¬†...¬´

¬ªAber ja¬´, er tr√∂stete mich, ¬ªtu nur flei√üig v√∂geln, da wachsen die
Duteln g'schwind.¬´ Ich zwickte bei dieser mir so erfreulichen Hoffnung
einigemal hintereinander die Arschbacken zusammen, und da h√∂rte er zu
reden auf: ¬ªAh¬†..., ah¬†..., jetzt¬†..., jetzt¬†..., jetzt¬†...¬´ Das war
alles, was er sagte. Aber ich f√ºhlte pl√∂tzlich tief in mir etwas Hei√ües
und wu√üte, da√ü er jetzt spritzte. Sein Schweif zuckte und zuckte, seine
Finger gruben sich in meine Fut ein und dabei kam eine hei√üe Welle nach
der andern, die ich in meinem Leib wie die Ber√ºhrung einer nassen
weichen Zungenspitze f√ºhlte.

Auch ich schnaufte, √§chzte, st√∂hnte und kniff meinen Hintern zusammen.
Als er mich loslie√ü und ich mich aufrichtete, flo√ü der Saft mir aus dem
Popo heraus, die Schenkel hinunter, so da√ü ich ganz na√ü war. Ich sp√ºrte
seinen Speer noch in mir nachwirken, hatte Kreuzschmerzen und war von
der gro√üen Aufregung ganz schwindlig.

Herr Horak stand wie ein Betrunkener vor mir und sein Schweif hing ihm
lang und triefend, gl√§nzend vor Feuchtigkeit zur Hose heraus. Er zog
sein Taschentuch, ich nahm es ihm aus der Hand und trocknete seine Nudel
vorsichtig und z√§rtlich ab.

¬ªH√∂rst du¬´, sagte er zu mir, ¬ªdu bist aber wie eine ausg'lernte Hur ...
So was ist mir noch nicht unterkommen...¬´

Statt aller Antwort fing ich nochmals von der Frau Reinthaler an:
¬ªSch√∂ne Duteln hat sie¬†..., so dick und so wei√ü¬†...¬´

Er meinte: ¬ªAber du bist mir lieber¬†...¬´

Das machte mich stolz, und ich fragte ihn: ¬ªWenn sie aber doch einmal
herunterkommt¬†...?¬´

¬ªNa, was willst denn?¬´

¬ªWen werdn Sie dann v√∂geln¬´, forschte ich, ¬ªsie oder mich?¬´

¬ªSelbstverst√§ndlich¬´, bekr√§ftigte er, ¬ªselbstverst√§ndlich dich!¬´

¬ªWas wird aber dann die Frau Reinthaler sagen?¬´

¬ªSoll's sagen, was will¬†...¬´

¬ªAlsdann, ich geh'¬†...¬´ Ich wandte mich zur Treppe. Aber er hielt mich
auf.

¬ªGeh, bleib noch¬´, bat er nun. Er sa√ü jetzt wieder auf seinem Fa√ü, hielt
mich zwischen seinen Knien und fragte: ¬ªAlso erz√§hl mir, du hast schon
fr√ºher gev√∂gelt?¬´

¬ªSo wie heut noch nicht.¬´

¬ªUnd wie denn?¬´

¬ªGar nicht.¬´

¬ªL√ºg nicht. Du hast mir's doch fr√ºher selbst g'sagt.¬´

¬ªNa ja¬†...¬´

¬ªAlso mit wem¬†...?¬´

¬ªIch wei√ü nicht.¬´

¬ªMit einem fremden Mann?¬´

¬ªJa, mit einem Soldaten.¬´

¬ªWo denn?¬´

¬ªAm F√ºrstenfeld¬†...¬´

¬ªJa, wie ist denn das gekommen¬†...?¬´

¬ªEr hat mich auf die Erd' gehaut und hat sich draufgelegt...¬´

¬ªWarum hast denn nicht geschrien¬†...?¬´

¬ªWeil ich Angst g'habt hab vor ihm.¬´

Er zog mich an sich: ¬ªNa, vielleicht hast es auch gern getan¬†...?¬´

Ich sch√ºttelte den Kopf: ¬ªO nein.¬´

¬ªAber¬´, meinte er, ¬ªmit mir tust es gern?¬´

Ich umarmte ihn und k√º√üte sein h√ºbsches rotes Gesicht. Als ich wegging,
rief er mir scherzend nach: ¬ªServus, kleine Geliebte!¬´

In diesen Tagen hatte ich den Herrn Ekhard ganz vergessen. Ich lauerte
immer auf den Herrn Horak, den ich eine Weile nicht sah. Ich lie√ü mich
von Franz nach unserer alten Manier beh√ºpfen und pa√üte in der Nacht
auf, ob ich meine Eltern nicht wieder erwische. Einmal sah ich sie, wie
sich die Mutter von hinten v√∂geln lie√ü. Dann wieder konnte ich bemerken,
da√ü der Vater unten lag und die Mutter oben, und einmal h√∂rte ich ein
Gespr√§ch. Ich war eben vom Bettkrachen aufgewacht. Meine Mutter lag
nackt da, der Vater hatte ihre Beine √ºber seine Achsel genommen und
v√∂gelte heftig, und ich vernahm eben, wie er sagte: ¬ªJetzt kommt's mir.¬´
Die Mutter rief fl√ºsternd dazwischen: ¬ªWart noch ... halt's noch zur√ºck
... so wart doch¬†...¬´ Aber er spritzte, was ich daraus merkte, da√ü er
die Beine der Mutter loslie√ü, ganz auf sie niedersank und laut √§chzte.
Die Mutter sagte auch gleich darauf: ¬ªSo sch√∂n, jetzt ist's mir nicht
einmal gekommen.¬´

Nach einer Weile, in der beide ruhig waren, fing sie an: ¬ªKannst nicht
noch eine Nummer machen?¬´

¬ªVielleicht sp√§ter¬´, brummte der Vater.

Aber sie war ganz zornig: ¬ªAh, was sp√§ter¬†..., da schnarchst du ja so
ein, da√ü du nicht zum derwecken bist¬†...¬´

¬ªIch kann jetzt nicht¬†...¬´

¬ªH√§ttst dich zur√ºckgehalten, ich will auch was haben¬´, schalt die
Mutter.

Der Vater wollte sie vertr√∂sten: ¬ªMu√üt halt warten bis sp√§ter.¬´

Sie atmete keuchend, schwieg ein paar Minuten, dann fing sie wieder an:
¬ªSteht er dir nimmer?¬´

¬ªJetzt nicht.¬´

¬ªWart!¬´ sagte die Mutter, ¬ªich werd' ihn schon in die H√∂h' bringen¬†...¬´
Sie setzte sich im Bett auf, und ich sah, wie sie √ºber den Vater gebeugt
heftig an seinem Schweif herumarbeitete. Er griff ihr dabei ein paarmal
an die Brust, lag aber dann ganz still da. Das dauerte beinahe eine
viertel Stunde. Dann sagte er verdrie√ülich: ¬ªSo la√ü doch, es geht ja
nicht, du siehst es ja¬†...¬´

Die Mutter weinte beinahe: ¬ªWas soll man denn da tun¬†...? Was soll man
denn da tun¬†...?¬´

¬ªGarnix kannst machen¬†...¬´, brummte der Vater, ¬ªla√ü stehen¬†..., es geht
halt nicht mehr¬†...¬´

Die Mutter jammerte, ri√ü aber noch weiter an dem Schwanz herum. Dann
sagte sie schwach: ¬ªMir tut schon die Hand weh¬†...¬´, und gleich darauf:
¬ªProbier' ich's halt so¬†...¬´ Sie b√ºckte sich und nahm die weiche Nudel
in den Mund. Ich h√∂rte sie lutschen und schmatzen und dabei schnaufen.
Nach einer Weile aber fuhr sie wieder auf und war zornig: ¬ªEr steht und
steht halt nicht. Jessas, das is ein Kreuz mit so ein' Mann¬†..., das
versteht er, da√ü er mir zwei-, dreimal die Fut auswetzt und dann spritzt
er ganz teppert hinein und denkt nicht dran, da√ü die Frau auch was haben
will.¬´

Mein Vater sagte kein Wort. Die Mutter aber gab nicht nach: ¬ªJa, was tu'
ich denn nur¬†..., jetzt hat mich das V√∂geln so aufgeregt¬†..., und dann
das Spielen mit dem Schwanz, und das in den Mund nehmen¬†..., was tu' ich
denn nur¬†..., das machst mir aber √∂fters so¬†..., das kenn' ich jetzt
schon¬†..., da kann man ja narrisch werdn ... Was m√∂chst denn du sagen,
wenn ich dich wegsto√üen m√∂cht vor dem Spritzen? Was? ... Du m√∂chst halt
zu einer andern gehn¬†..., die Mannsbilder¬†..., die k√∂nnen sich leicht
helfen, die laufen halt zu einer Hur ... Aber ich¬†..., was w√§r' denn,
wenn ich mich jetzt von ein' andern v√∂geln lassen m√∂cht'?¬´

¬ªMach was d'willst¬†...¬´

¬ªSo? Na, das werd' ich mir merken! Glaubst ich find' keinen, der was
mich v√∂geln will¬†...?¬´

Der Vater setzte sich im Bett auf, warf die Mutter um und griff ihr
zwischen die Beine. Sofort verstummte der Redeflu√ü meiner Mutter. Sie
warf und schleuderte sich unter der Hand des Vaters, der sie nach allen
Regeln der Fingerkunst bearbeitete und keuchte nun h√∂rbar. Der Vater
fa√üte mit der freien Hand nach der Brust der Mutter, spielte mit den
Warzen und bald vernahm ich, wie sie fl√ºsterte: ¬ªJetzt¬†..., jetzt
kommt's¬†..., steck den Finger ganz hinein, ganz¬†..., so¬†..., so¬†...,
ah¬†..., ah¬†...¬´

Der Vater brummte: ¬ªNa also, da√ü die arme Seel a Ruh hat.¬´

Gleich darauf schnarchten sie beide, nur ich lag wach und aufgeregt da,
und wu√üte nicht, was ich mir jetzt w√ºnschen sollte, den Franz, den
Ferdl, den Robert, den Herrn Ekhard, den Herrn Horak, den Soldaten oder
den Buben aus dem Geb√ºsch dort. Bei einigen Buben aus unserem Haus und
aus der Gasse, in der wir wohnten, war ich jetzt sehr bekannt. Wieder
mu√ü ich es wohl meinem Gesichtsausdruck und der unwillk√ºrlichen
Beredsamkeit meiner Augen zuschreiben, da√ü sie alle so ohne weiteres
annahmen, ich lasse mich v√∂geln, und man brauche mich nur anzugreifen.
Freilich waren alle diese Buben ebenso verdorben wie ich und mein
Bruder, und sie alle v√∂gelten ganz wie selbstverst√§ndlich ihre
Schwestern, ihre Freundinnen, kurz was sie eben kriegen konnten. Wenn
ich solche, mir oft ganz unbekannte Buben im Hausflur, auf der Treppe
oder auf der Stra√üe begegnete, dann schlugen sie mich wie zur Begr√º√üung
mit der flachen Hand leicht gegen die Fut, wogegen ich sie abwehrte,
oder ihnen, wenn sie mir gefielen, an das Hosent√ºrl griff.

Mit M√§dchen aus der Schule hatte ich wenig Umgang in dieser Zeit. Ich
war verschwiegen, und sprach ich manchmal mit einer davon, dann
vertraute sie mir entweder gleich an, da√ü sie schon selbst v√∂geln k√∂nne,
oder sie sah mich verst√§ndnislos, wohl auch ver√§chtlich an und mied von
da ab den Umgang mit mir.

Es geschah mehreremale, da√ü ein Bub, den ich durch so einen Griff an
sein Hosent√ºrl gereizt hatte, nicht locker lie√ü. Ich ging mit ihm dann
stets in den Vorkeller, der ja immer offenstand, und dort v√∂gelten wir
in aller Eile stehend, worauf wir auseinander liefen. Vielleicht mit
sechs oder acht Buben hab' ich es in dieser Zeit so getrieben.

Zwei Buben aber sind mir in Erinnerung geblieben, und die Geschichte des
einen h√§ngt in ihrem ferneren Verlauf mit dem Herrn Ekhard zusammen.
Dieser Bub, er hie√ü Alois, war der Sohn unseres Hausherrn, ein feiner
Bursch mit sch√∂nen blonden Haaren, mit einem dunkelbraunen Samtanzug,
kurzen Hosen, obwohl er schon zw√∂lf Jahre z√§hlte. Ich glaube, da√ü ich
ihn geliebt habe, denn sooft ich ihn traf, zitterte ich vor Sehnsucht
bei seinem Anblick. Er schien mir so stolz und fein und brav, und ich
sch√§mte mich sehr vor ihm, mu√üte ihn aber immer ansehen. Er schaute mir
immer mit einem kurzen Blick ins Gesicht und wandte sich dann mit
hochm√ºtiger Gleichg√ºltigkeit von mir ab.

Man konnte mit ihm nicht sprechen, denn er war immer von einem kleinen,
furchtbar dicken Stubenm√§dchen begleitet, die schon recht √§ltlich war
und eine schiefe Schulter hatte.

Zuf√§llig traf ich ihn aber einmal an einem Nachmittag allein im
Parterrekorridor vor der Kellert√ºre, um die ich geil herumschlich und
auf einen Buben, gleichviel auf welchen, wartete. Ich zitterte vor
Achtung und Sehnsucht, als ich ihn so unvermutet und allein vor mir
erblickte. Er war ohne Hut, hatte aber seinen gro√üen wei√üen
Schillerkragen und seinen Samtanzug an. Alois blieb vor mir stehen und
sah mich an. Ich traute mich nicht, ein Wort zu sprechen, wollte aber,
da√ü er mit mir in den Keller gehen solle. Da er nichts redete, l√§chelte
ich. Er blieb ernst. Ich wagte es endlich, ihn zu fragen: ¬ªWarst schon
einmal im Keller unten¬†...?¬´

¬ªNein¬´, erwiderte er ernst. ¬ªAber gehn wir zusammen herunter.¬´

Auf der Treppe meinte er leise: ¬ªKann uns da niemand sehen¬†...?¬´

Dieser Ausspruch einigte uns und brachte sofort alles zwischen uns ins
Klare. Trotzdem unterstand ich mich nicht, ihn anzugreifen und fl√ºsterte
nur: ¬ªEs ist ja niemand da.¬´

Er sagte nichts, aber unten im halbdunklen Gang standen wir einander
gegen√ºber und redeten kein Wort. Uns beiden war wohl bang, aber ich war
so unendlich gl√ºcklich, da√ü ich den Atem anhielt. Er streichelte mich an
der Wange, und ich traute mich, diese Liebkosung zu erwidern. Dann
streichelte er mich auf der Brust, und endlich strich seine Hand immer
tiefer und tiefer, bis sie √ºber den Kleidern auf meiner Fut lag. Ich
stand gegen die Wand gelehnt, still und bebend. Er pre√üte seine Hand
st√§rker zwischen meine Beine. Ich gab nach, und er tastete √ºber den
Kleidern an derselben Stelle hinan.

¬ªMagst?¬´ fl√ºsterte er leise.

Ich str√§ubte mich. Zum erstenmal str√§ubte ich mich und sagte: ¬ªWenn aber
wer kommt¬†...?¬´

Er hob mir langsam die R√∂cke auf und stellte sich zwischen meine Beine.
Sein Gesicht blieb ernst, und ich f√ºhlte, wie er mit seinem Schweif an
meinem Loch herumtastete. Ich war so aufgeregt, da√ü es mir
augenblicklich kam, sowie ich nur die erste Ber√ºhrung seiner warmen
Eichel wahrnahm. Meine Geilheit hielt jedoch an. Davon, da√ü es mir
gekommen war, und wohl auch von meiner Aufregung, war meine Spalte ganz
feucht geworden.

Er blieb immer ernst und ruhig. Mit der einen Hand fa√üte er meinen Popo,
dr√ºckte mich gegen sich, so da√ü ich nur mit dem R√ºcken an der Mauer
lehnte, und im n√§chsten Moment √§chzte ich schwer auf, weil ich einen
Aufschrei der Wollust unterdr√ºckt hatte. Mit einem einzigen, wunderbar
geschickten Sto√ü war er mir n√§mlich ganz bis ans Heft in den Leib
gefahren. Es war ein fester, sehr kurzer und ziemlich dicker Schweif,
und er r√ºhrte sich ein paar Sekunden nicht, als er ihn hineingesteckt
hatte. Dann f√ºhrte er kurze St√∂√üe gegen mich, aber ohne da√ü er seinen
Schwanz dabei nur einen Millimeter herauszog. Er blieb wie angegossen
drinnen stecken, und ich war halb besinnungslos vor Geilheit. Dann fing
er an im Kreise zu bohren, als wollte er mein Loch ausweiten, aber er
blieb dabei immer tief drinnen stecken. Das war mir noch nicht
geschehen. Ich quietschte leise, weil es mir wieder kam und Alois sagte
auf einmal: ¬ªSchlu√ü mit Genu√ü!¬´ Ehe ich Zeit hatte √ºber diesen Ausdruck
√ºberrascht zu sein, √§nderte er seine Sto√üweise, zog n√§mlich seinen
Schwanz langsam ganz heraus, fuhr dann langsam wieder ganz hinein, so
etwa vier- bis f√ºnfmal, und dann sp√ºrte ich ihn spritzen; es war nicht
viel, aber doch spritzte er, sein Stachel zuckte heftig, wie er jetzt
herein zu mir kam, und ganz gleichzeitig mit ihm kam es auch mir zum
letztenmale. Als er fertig war, wischte er sich den Schweif an meinem
Hemd ab, steckte ihn in die Hose, klopfte mich auf die Wange und sagte:
¬ªDu puderst besser als die Klementine¬†...¬´ Da ich nicht wu√üte, wer die
Klementine sei, schwieg ich, aber ich wunderte mich gar nicht, da√ü so
ein feiner Bub v√∂geln k√∂nne, mit wem er will. Bevor er wegging, schlug
er mir vor: ¬ªKomm morgen nachmittag zu mir. Meine Eltern fahren fort, da
sind wir allein.¬´

Am andern Nachmittag l√§utete ich klopfenden Herzens an der T√ºre der
Hausherrenwohnung. Die K√∂chin √∂ffnete mir: ¬ªIst der Herr Alois da¬†...?¬´
fragte ich sch√ºchtern.

Sie lachte: ¬ªJa, der -- junge Herr ist da drin¬†...¬´

Ich wurde in sein Zimmer gewiesen, das sehr gro√ü und wundersch√∂n wei√ü
m√∂bliert war. Mir kam es wie im Paradies vor. Er zeigte mir sein sch√∂n
lackiertes wei√ües Bett, das hellblau √ºberzogen war. Dann seinen gro√üen
Diwan, der wei√ü und blau √ºberzogen war und sagte, auf das Bett deutend:
¬ªDa schlaf' ich¬´, und auf den Diwan weisend: ¬ªDa schlaft das
Kinderm√§del.¬´

Dann zeigte er mir seine Bilderb√ºcher, seine Soldaten, seine Gewehre und
seinen S√§bel, und ich h√§tte nie gedacht, hatte es nie geahnt, da√ü es ein
Kind so gut haben k√∂nne. Mir fiel es gar nicht ein, da√ü man in so einem
herrlichen Zimmer auch solche Dinge machen k√∂nne, wie das, was wir
gestern im Keller getan hatten.

Nach ein paar Minuten kam das kleine, dicke, √§ltliche Kinderm√§del
herein, das Alois immer begleitete, wenn er in die Schule ging oder aus
der Schule kam. Wir waren also nicht mehr allein, und so entfiel f√ºr
mich auch der letzte Gedanke an eine Wiederholung der gestrigen Spiele.
Das Kinderm√§dchen setzte sich auf den Diwan und strickte und k√ºmmerte
sich gar nicht um uns, und wir sa√üen bei dem Tisch, der ganz mit
Soldaten bedeckt war und spielten. Auf einmal stand Alois auf, ging zum
Kinderm√§dchen, stellte sich vor sie hin und griff ihr an den dicken,
weit vorstehenden Busen. Ich war so paff, da√ü ich sprachlos dasa√ü. Sie
stie√ü ihn weg und brummte. ¬ªAber Alois¬†...¬´ Und dabei schaute sie
mi√ütrauisch zu mir her√ºber. Alois sagte: ¬ªLa√ü nur gehen ... die Pepi
versteht schon alles.¬´ Und wieder griff er ihr an die gro√üen,
vorstehenden Br√ºste. Sie lie√ü sich abt√§tscheln, ohne ihn weiter
abzuwehren, und meinte nur: ¬ªVerstehn wird die Pepi schon, das glaub'
ich, aber ob sie's nicht weitersagt¬†...?¬´ Ich stand statt aller Antwort
vom Sessel auf, ging auch zu ihr hin, nahm ihre andere Brust und pre√üte
sie. Sie war ganz weich und wellig, und das knochige, √§ltliche Gesicht
der Kindermagd mit den schielenden kleinen Augen wurde ganz rot. Alois
hatte schon seinen Schweif herausgezogen und dr√ºckte ihn dem Kinderm√§del
in die Hand. Sie ergriff ihn und spielte damit, aber nicht so wie ich es
immer machte. Sie hielt ihn mit dem Mittel- und Daumenfinger und mit dem
Zeigefinger tupfte sie leise an die Eichel, da√ü die Vorhaut immer mehr
davon herunterging.

¬ªKennst du das?¬´ fragte sie mich mit einem L√§cheln, das auf ihrem
m√ºrrischen Gesicht wie ein Grinsen sich ausnahm.

¬ªO ja¬†...¬´, nickte ich.

¬ªNa, und wie hei√üt das?¬´

¬ªEin Schwanz¬´, sagte ich leise.

¬ªUnd was macht der Schwanz?¬´ Sie pr√ºfte mich.

¬ªV√∂geln¬†...¬´, antwortete ich fl√ºsternd.

Sie begann zu schnaufen und klopfte rascher mit ihrem Zeigefinger auf
die rosige Eichel von Alois. ¬ªUnd ... was v√∂gelt er ... der
Schwanz¬†...?¬´ Sie schnappte mit den Lippen.

¬ªDie Fut¬†...¬´, antwortete Alois f√ºr mich. Er hatte seiner Klementine --
ich wu√üte jetzt, wer die Klementine sei, von der er gestern im Keller
gesprochen hatte -- die Bluse aufgerissen und w√ºhlte mit beiden H√§nden in
ihren hin und her schwappenden Br√ºsten. Sie lie√ü von mir ab und pr√ºfte
jetzt Alois. Ich merkte, es war ein Spiel, das die beiden oft ge√ºbt
hatten.

¬ªWas tut der Schwanz in der Fut?¬´

¬ªV√∂geln.¬´ Alois antwortete gleichm√§√üig, ernst und so ruhig wie immer.

Mit zitterndem Mund fragte Klementine weiter: ¬ªWie hei√üt das noch¬†...?¬´

Und Alois z√§hlte auf: ¬ªPudern, Ficken, Remmeln, Bimsen, Petschieren,
Stemmen.¬´ Sein Ton war ernst.

Klementine aber wurde immer aufgeregter.

¬ªWas kann der Schwanz noch?¬´

¬ªIm Popo kitzeln¬†..., in' Mund spritzen¬†..., zwischen den Duteln
liegen¬†...¬´

¬ªUnd was will der Alois jetzt machen¬†...?¬´

Ohne seine Antwort abzuwarten, lehnte sie sich zur√ºck und schlo√ü die
Augen. Alois √∂ffnete ihre Bluse mehr und nahm ihre beiden Br√ºste heraus.
Sie hingen tief herab und ich sah, da√ü sie Warzen hatte, die so weit
wegstanden wie ein kleiner Finger. Alois nahm abwechselnd die eine dann
die andere Brust in die H√§nde, nahm die Warzen in den Mund und sog mit
aller Kraft dran, da√ü es schmatzte, und jedesmal zuckte Klementine mit
derjenigen Schulter, die der eben gek√º√üten Brust entsprach. Es war ein
Zucken, das ihr wie ein epileptischer Krampf oder wie ein elektrischer
Schlag durch die eine K√∂rperh√§lfte ging. Sie hatte den Kopf auf die
Diwanlehne zur√ºckgelehnt, hielt die Augen geschlossen, und Alois
arbeitete wie abgerichtet. Nachdem er sie so eine Weile, bald links,
bald rechts an den Brustwarzen begeilt hatte, b√ºckte er sich, hob ihr
die R√∂cke in die H√∂he, da√ü die nackten, kurzen, dicken Beine
Klementinens sichtbar wurden. Alois gl√§ttete die aufgesch√ºrzten R√∂cke
auf Klementinens Bauch, da√ü sie nicht bauschten, dann trat er zwischen
ihre Beine, hielt mit der einen Hand ihre dicht behaarte Fut gespreizt,
und mit der anderen lenkte er seinen kurzen, strammen Schweif geschickt
ins Loch, so da√ü er mit einem Ruck bis an der Wurzel drin war. Dann
legte er sich auf Klementine, und nun ergriff sie ihn mit beiden H√§nden
am Popo und hielt ihn fest an sich, so da√ü er wohl sto√üen, aber nicht
ein Haarbreit hinaus konnte. Klementine hielt ihre Augen geschlossen und
schnappte nach Luft. Alois hatte jetzt in jeder Hand eine Brustwarze von
ihr und zupfte wie mechanisch daran. Er war ernst wie tags zuvor, da er
mich im Kellergang so gut gev√∂gelt hatte. Nach etwa zehn Minuten sagte
Klementine auf einmal: ¬ªSchlu√ü mit Genu√ü¬´, worauf sie ihre H√§nde vom
Popo Alois' loslie√ü. Er fuhr jetzt, wie ich sah, langsam ganz hinein.
Klementine sprang vor Wollust mit ihrem Hinterteil in die H√∂he. Dann
steckte er ihn wieder langsam, langsam ganz heraus, und Klementine bekam
ihr epilepsie√§hnliches Zucken, so stark, da√ü man meinen konnte, es
rei√üe sie entzwei. Wieder zog Alois seinen Schweif langsam heraus.
Klementine drohte zu ersticken. Wieder drang er allm√§hlich und z√∂gernd
in sie ein, und sie ward von ihren Zuckungen wild gebeutelt. Alois
selbst blieb ernst. Das wiederholte sich so sechs- bis achtmal,
w√§hrenddem er immer aufmerksam in Klementinens Gesicht schaute. So wie
aber der Krampf aus ihren Z√ºgen wich und sie in Befriedigtsein
erschlaffend ganz in sich zusammenfiel, wurde Alois pl√∂tzlich dunkelrot,
stie√ü zweimal heftig zu und fiel dann mit dem Gesicht auf Klementinens
nackte Brust. Er hatte gespritzt.

Eine Minute lang blieb er so liegen, und Klementine ganz still unter
ihm, und ich stand dabei und hatte nicht √ºbel Lust, mir die R√∂cke
aufzuheben und mich selbst zu bedienen. Dann aber richtete sich
Klementine auf. Alois l√∂ste sich von ihr, wischte seinen Schweif an der
Innenseite ihres Rockes ab, und wir drei sa√üen nebeneinander auf dem
Diwan. Klementine sah mich von der Seite her an: ¬ªNa, hat's dir denn
gefallen¬†...?¬´

Ich l√§chelte nur. Und Alois, der auf der anderen Seite sa√ü, schaute √ºber
Klementinens Busenw√∂lbung zu mir her√ºber. Sie fragte mich: ¬ªKennst du
das schon?¬´ Ich l√§chelte wieder statt einer Antwort. Sie forschte
weiter: ¬ªHast du's schon einmal gemacht?¬´ Ihr gegen√ºber, ich wei√ü selbst
nicht warum, wagte ich es nicht, die Sache zu leugnen. Ja sagen wollte
ich auch nicht, und so lachte ich versch√§mt, was ja ganz gut als
Zustimmung gelten konnte. Klementine meinte: ¬ªDas werden wir gleich
sehen.¬´ Ohne Umst√§nde hob sie mir die R√∂cke in die H√∂he und untersuchte
meine Fut. ¬ªUh jeh¬´, meinte sie, w√§hrend sie daran herumgriff, ¬ªda ist
schon manches geschehen.¬´ Mit gro√üer Behutsamkeit und eh ich mich
dessen versah, bohrte sie mir ihren kleinen Finger ins Loch: ¬ªAber da
kann man ja schon hinein¬´, rief sie aus. Und zu Alois gewendet fuhr sie
fort: ¬ªAlois, da kann man schon hinein.¬´ Ich zuckte bei diesen Worten,
und sie bemerkte es. ¬ªSoll der Alois jetzt dich v√∂geln?¬´ fragte sie.
¬ªJa¬´, antwortete ich ihr ohne Zaudern, denn ich hatte schon gef√ºrchtet,
ich werde leer ausgehen. Sie drehte sich wieder zu Alois und redete ihn
an: ¬ªNa Bubi, magst du das sch√∂ne M√§di da auch ein bissel pudern? Was
glaubst du, ha?¬´ Alois stand auf und wollte sich mir n√§hern. Klementine
aber hielt ihn ab. ¬ªWart¬´, meinte sie, ¬ªich will dir erst wieder dein
Schwanzerl richten.¬´ Diese Vorsicht war gewi√ü n√∂tig, denn Alois' Zipfel
hing ziemlich tr√ºbselig herab. Er mochte mit Klementine schon mehr
Reitpartien gemacht haben, als f√ºr sein Alter zutr√§glich war. Aber
freilich, die Wiederaufrichtung h√§tte ich selbst ebenso gut und ebenso
gerne besorgt. Allerdings w√§re es mir nicht m√∂glich gewesen, es auf
dieselbe Weise zu tun wie Klementine. Sie nahm den schlappen Schwanz
zuerst in ihren Mund und feuchtete ihn an, hierauf bettete sie ihn genau
zwischen ihre beiden Br√ºste und pre√üte diese mit den eigenen H√§nden so
zusammen, da√ü es aussah, als v√∂gle Alois in einen weichen Popo hinein.
Auch das schien die gute Klementine sehr aufzuregen, so da√ü ich schon
f√ºrchtete, sie werde mich wieder um die Sache betr√ºgen. Sie redete
fortw√§hrend dabei: ¬ªWo ist denn mein Loisl jetzt ... was? ... Ist er
jetzt bei die guten, lieben Duterln ... ja ... ist das nicht gut? Was
... so! so! ... Langsam steht er wieder, ha? ... Wer hat denn jetzt
sch√∂n gev√∂gelt¬†..., was¬†..., wer denn¬†...? Der Loisl¬†...? Ja¬†...! Hat
der Loisl aber eine gute Klementine ... nicht wahr¬†...? Das m√∂cht' eine
andere nicht tun¬†..., was¬†...? so einen kleinen Buben pudern lassen¬†...,
gelt? Aber die Klementine la√üt das Loisl pudern¬†..., nicht wahr¬†...,
sooft er will¬†..., nicht wahr¬†...?¬´ Und halb zu mir gewendet, fuhr sie
fort: ¬ªDa in der Nacht¬†..., wenn alles schon still ist¬†..., da kommt der
Loisl aus dem Bett sch√∂n auf den Diwan her zu mir ... und da tun wir's
so gut miteinander machen¬†..., was? Der Loisl kann's aber auch gut, und
das hat ihm die Klementine gelernt¬†..., ja!¬´

Ich glaubte schon nicht mehr, da√ü ich daran komme, aber Loisl zog seinen
Schwanz aus der Dutelpresse heraus und fragte: ¬ªAlso soll ich jetzt die
Pepi nehmen¬†...?¬´ Sein Schweif stand wieder kerzengerad, und ich mu√üte
mich zur√ºckhalten, nicht danach zu greifen, denn ich f√ºrchtete mich vor
dieser dicken, h√§√ülichen Person, die noch zu √ºberlegen schien, ob sie's
erlauben solle. Mochte sie nun mein Stillschweigen damit erkaufen
wollen, da√ü sie auch mich von ihrem Alois besteigen lie√ü, oder mochte
sie sich ein begeilendes Schauspiel daraus versprechen, da√ü sie dem
V√∂geln zusah, das wei√ü ich nat√ºrlich heute nicht mehr. Kurzum, sie
willigte ein und r√ºckte auf dem Diwan zur Seite. Ich mu√üte mich mit dem
Kopf in ihren Scho√ü legen. Alois bestieg mich, streifte mir mit seinem
ernsten Gesicht die R√∂cke hinauf, gl√§ttete sie, dann spreizte er mit
seinen Fingern meine Spalte und mit einem einzigen Ruck war er wieder,
wie am Tag zuvor bei mir, nur noch tiefer und besser, weil wir diesmal
nicht stehen mu√üten.

Gerne h√§tte ich was gesagt, h√§tte ihn gestreichelt oder dergleichen,
denn mir gingen seine kurzen, regelm√§√üigen St√∂√üe durch Mark und Bein.
Ich empfand aber eine lebhafte Scheu vor Klementine, in deren Scho√ü ich
lag, und die mir aufmerksam ins Gesicht blickte. Daf√ºr redete sie desto
mehr.

¬ªIst er drin bei dir?¬´ fragte sie mich.

¬ªGanz drin ist er¬´, fl√ºsterte ich zu ihr empor.

Sie schob ihren Arm zwischen unsere aneinander gedr√ºckten Leiber und
tastete √ºber meinen Bauch nach meiner Fut hin. Dort spielte sie bald an
meiner Spalte, bald wieder an Alois' Hodensack. Ich keuchte, weil ihr
Busen dabei ganz auf meinem Gesicht lag.

Sie richtete sich wieder auf und setzte ihre Fragen fort: ¬ªSchmeckt's
dir?¬´

Ich gab keine Antwort, sondern schlo√ü die Augen.

¬ªGelt ja?¬´ sagte sie, ¬ªder Loisl v√∂gelt gut¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬´, rief ich aus und begann nun unter ihm mit dem Popo zu h√ºpfen.

¬ªHast du schon einmal so gut gev√∂gelt¬†...?¬´ wollte sie wissen.

¬ªNein¬†...¬´ Und mir war wirklich so, als h√§tte ich noch niemals eine
solche Wonne gesp√ºrt.

¬ªMit wem v√∂gelst du denn sonst¬†...?¬´ erkundigte sie sich weiter.

¬ªMit'n Fredl¬´, sag ich, weil der ja nicht mehr im Hause wohnte. Aber vor
Klementine gab es keine L√ºgen.

¬ªMit wem noch?¬´ Sie fragte das in so strengem Ton, da√ü ich ihr antworten
mu√üte.

¬ªMit dem Robert¬†...¬´

¬ªUnd weiter¬†...?¬´

¬ªMit meinem Bruder¬†...¬´ Unter den St√∂√üen, die ich empfing und die mich
mit aufregungsvoller Lust ersch√ºtterten, fielen diese Namen wie von
selbst aus meinem Mund. Gl√ºcklicherweise forschte sie nicht weiter,
sondern kam auf eine neue Idee. Sie √∂ffnete mein Leibchen, schob mir
das Hemd so weit herunter, da√ü meine kleinen Brustwarzen blo√ülagen,
feuchtete ihre Fingerspitze an, und spielte leise wie mit einer
leckenden Zunge daran herum. Immer schneller, immer schneller, und bald
traten meine Brustwarzen, die ganz flach gewesen waren, wie die kleinen
Linsen so gro√ü, hervor und wurden ganz hart. Dazu vollf√ºhrte Alois jetzt
seine drehenden Bewegungen, die mir die Fut ausweiteten, die mich aber
ganz verr√ºckt machten vor Kitzel. Unter dieser Behandlung schwand mir
alle Scheu, ich kreischte leise, rief: ¬ªAch, mir kommt's¬†..., mir
kommt's¬†...!¬´ und warf mich mit meinem Popo jeder Bewegung, die Alois
ausf√ºhrte, entgegen. Mir schien der Reiz, den das V√∂geln gew√§hrt, von
√ºberall herzukommen, nicht nur aus der Fut allein. Sanfte und hei√üe
Schauer flogen mir √ºber die Brust, zuckten mir √ºber den R√ºcken, huschten
√ºberall auf meinem K√∂rper herum, so da√ü ich es nicht auszuhalten
glaubte. Wie nun gar Alois jetzt mit den Worten: ¬ªSchlu√ü mit Genu√ü¬´
endete, womit er sich zum Spritzen anschickte, wie er jetzt langsam ganz
herausfuhr, so da√ü ich die Fut aus Angst ihres Inhaltes beraubt zu
werden, heftig zusammenzog; wie er nun wieder langsam einfuhr, da√ü ich
mit meiner Spalte zuschnappte vor Wonne, diesen dicken, blutwarmen
Schaft wieder zu sp√ºren, und wie Klementine dabei meine Brustwarzen
streichelte, kam es mir dreimal hintereinander. Das dritte mal ging ein
Zerren und Strecken durch meinen ganzen K√∂rper bis in die Fu√üspitzen, so
da√ü meine gro√üe Zehe sich wie im Krampf schmerzhaft verbog, und ich
einen harten Schrei ausstie√ü. Klementine aber hielt mir a Tempo noch den
Mund zu. In diesem Augenblick drang wie eine kleine brennhei√üe Welle
der Same von Alois zu mir. Ich f√ºhlte, wie sein Schweif im Ausspritzen
pulsierte, und zum viertenmal kam es mir, aber so heftig wie noch nie.
Und weil ich nicht schreien konnte, bi√ü und leckte ich die innere Fl√§che
der Hand Klementinens, die sie fest auf meinen Lippen gepre√üt hielt.

Ich mu√üte noch eine Stunde lang am Diwan liegen bleiben, so aufgel√∂st
und erm√ºdet war ich von dieser Remmelei. Und ich sah zu, wie Klementine
Alois auf den Diwan stehen lie√ü, mit dem R√ºcken gegen die Lehne. Sie sa√ü
vor ihm, lie√ü seinen Schweif wieder in ihren Busen h√§ngen, und dann nahm
sie ihn heraus. Er hing noch immer schlapp herunter. Da nahm sie ihn in
den Mund, suzelte daran, und mit ihrer Zungenspitze leckte sie an seinen
Hoden. Sie dr√ºckte ihren Kopf zwischen seine Beine, und leckte ihn tief
unten, zwischen Schwanz und Popo, und ich sah wie es ihn vor diesem Reiz
beutelte. Aber er machte dasselbe, ernste, gleichm√§√üige Gesicht. Nur als
Klementine jetzt sich seinen Schweif ganz in den Mund stie√ü und so ein
wenig hin- und herfuhr, wie beim V√∂geln mit der Fut, da legte er ihr die
Hand auf den Kopf. Sie r√ºhrte sich nicht, hielt den Schwanz im Mund, da√ü
man nicht das geringste von ihm sah und nur an den Bewegungen ihrer
Wangen konnte ich merken, da√ü sie heftig daran sog. Auf einmal begann
Alois seine V√∂gelst√∂√üe. Sogleich fuhr Klementine zur√ºck, und ich sah,
da√ü er Alois wiederum stand, zum drittenmal. Er haschte nach dem Kopf
von Klementine und dr√ºckte ihr seinen Schweif wieder in den Mund: ¬ªDa
bleiben¬´, befahl er. Ich staunte nur, wie sie gehorchte. Sie hielt ihren
Mund geduldig hin, und Alois v√∂gelte sie so mit seinen kurzen St√∂√üen,
lange, sehr lange. Ich lag ziemlich teilnahmslos da, ohne Aufregung,
nur mit einer ziemlichen Neugierde. Klementine zuckte am ganzen K√∂rper,
kr√ºmmte sich und wand sich hin und her, aber ihre Lippen umschlossen
getreulich den Schweif von Alois. Nur einmal lie√ü sie ihn los, und bat:
¬ªKomm v√∂geln, Bubi¬†..., komm¬†...¬´ Er aber erwischte sie gleich wieder
und sagte w√ºtend: ¬ªDableiben, kruzifix noch einmal¬†...¬´ Wieder lie√ü sie
sich seine Stange in den Mund stecken, und ihn drin hin und herschieben.
Dann sagte Alois leise: ¬ªSchlu√ü mit Genu√ü.¬´ Ich sah, wie sein Schwanz
langsam und wei√ü aus den roten Lippen Klementinens herausglitt bis zur
Spitze und wie er ganz langsam in ihr wieder verschwand. Das zweitemal
aber ri√ü Klementine sich los: ¬ªNicht spritzen¬´, bat sie. Alois wollte
ihren Kopf wieder zu sich heran rei√üen. ¬ªNein, nein¬´, sagte sie hitzig.
¬ªBubi soll mich v√∂geln, v√∂geln Bubi, nicht in Mund, unten v√∂geln, wo's
gut ist¬†...¬´ Sie rauften eine kurze Weile miteinander. Klementine war
furchtbar aufgeregt und pl√∂tzlich packte sie Alois wie man ein kleines
Kind unter den Achseln anfa√üt, ri√ü ihn mit einem Ruck an sich, warf ihn
auf den Diwan nieder, und eh er sich's versah, hockte sie mit
hochgerafften Kleidern und tief herabbaumelnden Br√ºsten auf ihm und
begrub seine Lanze in ihren Scho√ü. Ihr breiter Hinterer flog auf und
nieder, vielleicht sechzigmal in der Minute. Alois hielt eine ihrer
langstieligen Brustwarzen in seinem Mund, und zuletzt lag sie
bewegungslos, ein schnaufender Klumpen auf Alois, der unter ihr ganz
verschwand.

Ich bekam dann zur Jause Chokolade, die ich noch nie getrunken hatte.
Und als ich fortging begleitete mich Klementine hinaus. Im finsteren
Vorzimmer griff sie mir noch einmal unter die R√∂cke, w√ºhlte ein wenig
in meiner Fut, w√§hrend sie mir sagte: ¬ªAlsdann g'scheiter sein und nix
ausplauschen, dann darfst du wiederkommen.¬´ Sie schenkte mir ein Zehnerl
und schob mich zur T√ºre hinaus.

Der zweite Bub, der mir besonders lebhaft in Erinnerung geblieben ist,
hie√ü Schani. Er wohnte ein paar H√§user weiter weg, in derselben Gasse,
in der ich wohnte. Schani war damals dreizehn Jahre alt, und ich mochte
ihn sehr gerne, denn er war ein blasser, schlanker, sch√∂ngewachsener
Junge, hatte pechschwarzes Haar und kohlenrabenschwarze Augen, und er
hielt sich immer so nobel, wenn er ging. Wir sagten uns Servus, wenn wir
uns trafen, es war aber sonst nie etwas zwischen uns gewesen, auch im
Gespr√§ch nicht. Weil n√§mlich Schani mit meinem √§ltesten Bruder Lorenz in
eine Klasse ging und au√üerdem auch mit ihm befreundet war, f√ºrchtete ich
mich davor, von solchen Dingen mit ihm zu reden, und dachte, er sei ganz
so keusch wie Lorenz. Manchmal kam er zu Lorenz auf Besuch, sie machten
ihre Aufgaben zusammen und waren beide immer ganz still und ernst. Mit
mir war Schani aber immer freundlich. An einem Nachmittag kam er einmal,
wie Lorenz nicht zu Hause war. Lorenz und Franz hatten aus irgendeinem
Grund zum Vater in die Werkstatt gehen m√ºssen, weit, bis in die
Josefstadt. Die Mutter war in der Waschk√ºche. Als er h√∂rte, da√ü Lorenz
nicht da sei, wollte er wieder umkehren. Ich bat ihn aber: ¬ªGeh, bleib
ein bissl da¬†...¬´ Er zauderte, und deshalb setzte ich hinzu: ¬ªDer Lorenz
mu√ü gleich kommen¬†...¬´ Und weil er noch immer unschl√ºssig war, sagte
ich: ¬ªBleib da, ich f√ºrcht' mich immer, wenn ich allein bin.¬´ Da trat er
√ºber die Schwelle. Wir waren beide verlegen und gingen aus der K√ºche in
das Zimmer. Zwar verschwand unsere Verlegenheit bald, aber wir hatten
uns nichts zu sagen. Mir aber hatten es seine schwarzen Augen angetan,
und ich dr√ºckte mich wie eine Schmeichelkatze an ihn heran. Er lie√ü
sich's gefallen und l√§chelte; sagte aber nichts. Da schlang ich meine
Arme um seinen Hals und rieb mich mit meinem Unterleib fest an ihn. Ich
erwartete, er werde jetzt tun wie die anderen, mir unter die R√∂cke
greifen oder seinen Schwanz herausnehmen und in meine Hand legen. Aber
er tat nichts von alledem. Er lie√ü sich umarmen, l√§chelte nur und r√ºhrte
sich nicht. Wie mir der Gedanke kam, wei√ü ich nicht, aber ich lie√ü ihn
los, trat an das Bett, legte mich darauf und sagte: ¬ªKomm her.¬´ Er kam
zu mir und stand vor dem Bett. Ich hob ruckweise meine Kleider: ¬ªJetzt
siehst du noch nichts¬†...?¬´ sagte ich, ¬ªjetzt auch noch nicht?¬´ Nun
lagen meine Knie frei. ¬ªJetzt auch noch nicht?¬´ Ich hob wieder ein
bi√üchen und meine nackten Schenkel kamen zum Vorschein. ¬ªJetzt auch noch
nicht?¬´ Er schaute mich an, l√§chelte und r√ºhrte sich nicht. ¬ªAber
jetzt!¬´ rief ich und deckte mich auf. Er stand da, und ich lag und
wartete. Meine Aufregung war gestiegen, um so mehr, als ich √ºberzeugt
war, da√ü sein Schwanz, wie der von Alois, ganz zu mir passen w√ºrde. Ich
war begierig ihn zu sehen und zu halten und griff nach Schanis Hose. Er
trat einen Schritt zur√ºck. ¬ªLa√ü gehn¬´, bat er tr√ºb und verlegen, ¬ªich
kann's nicht tun¬†...¬´

¬ªWarum nicht?¬´ Ich war mit einem Satz vom Bett unten.

¬ªSo nicht. Ich kann's nicht tun¬†...¬´ sagte er leise.

¬ªZeig her.¬´ Ich langte schnell nach seinem Hosent√ºrl. ¬ªZeig her, ob du's
nicht kannst.¬´

Er wollte mir entschl√ºpfen, aber ich hielt schon seine Kn√∂pfe fest. So
blieb er stehen, und ich w√ºhlte in seiner Hose nach dem Schweif, den ich
auch bald hervorzog. Er war d√ºnn und sehr lang, und mir fiel es nur auf,
da√ü seine Vorhaut beinahe bis √ºber die ganze Eichel zur√ºckgeschoben war.
Aber sein Schwanz stand so gut wie nur irgendeiner. Und ich war so
begierig, mir ihn in die Spalte zu stecken, da√ü ich geschwind meine
R√∂cke aufhob. Er wehrte mich aber wieder ab. ¬ªLa√ü gehn, ich kann nicht.¬´
Ich war ratlos vor Schreck und Staunen: ¬ªDu kannst ja¬´, sagte ich
eifrig; ¬ªdu l√ºgst, du kannst schon, du willst nur nicht.¬´

¬ªIch kann wirklich nicht. Ich m√∂cht' schon selber gern, aber es geht
nicht.¬´ Er sagte das so ernst und traurig, da√ü es Eindruck auf mich
machte und ich neugierig wurde. ¬ªDann sag's, warum es nicht geht, wenn's
wahr ist, dann sag's¬†...¬´, dr√§ngte ich in ihn. Ich hielt seinen Schweif
noch immer in der Hand. Er entwand sich mir, steckte ihn ein und
kn√∂pfelte die Hose zu. ¬ªDas kann ich dir nicht sagen.¬´

¬ªWeil du l√ºgst¬´, beharrte ich. ¬ªDu willst nicht v√∂geln¬†..., wenn du
nicht willst, dann sag's nur, aber l√ºg nicht so!¬´

¬ªIch l√ºg' nicht¬´, wiederholte er. Dann griff er mir, ohne mir die
Kleider aufzuheben, an die Fut, z√∂gerte ein wenig und wiederholte
zuletzt: ¬ªNein, ich kann nicht¬†...¬´

¬ªJa, aber wegen was denn?¬´

¬ªWegen dieser verfluchten Frauenzimmer¬†...¬´ brach er los.

¬ªWas denn f√ºr Frauenzimmer¬†...?¬´

¬ªZweimal hab' ich heut schon pudern m√ºssen¬†...¬´, sagte er zornig.

¬ªWen denn¬†...?¬´ Ich brannte vor Begierde, es zu h√∂ren.

¬ªZweimal¬´, wiederholte er. ¬ªUnd wenn ich dich jetzt v√∂gel, dann steht er
mir auf die Nacht nicht, und dann haut sie mich durch.¬´

¬ªJa, wer denn?¬´

¬ªDie Mutter¬†...¬´

¬ªDeine Mutter¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa.¬´

¬ªDie haut dich durch, wenn dir der Schwanz nicht steht¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa.¬´

¬ªAber warum denn? V√∂gelst du vielleicht gar deine Mutter?¬´

¬ªIch mu√ü¬†...¬´ Er war in Zorn geraten. ¬ªDiese gottsverfluchten
Frauenzimmer¬´, rief er aus, ¬ªdie sind ja alle miteinand so schlecht¬†...¬´

¬ªUnd heut hast sie schon zweimal gev√∂gelt¬†...?¬´

¬ªO nein, sie kommt erst am Abend z' Haus.¬´

¬ªAlsdann, wen hast du denn gefickt?¬´

¬ªMeine Schwestern¬†...¬´

¬ªDeine Schwestern¬†...? Alle zwei¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa, alle zwei, und wenn ich dich jetzt v√∂geln m√∂cht', dann m√∂cht er mir
vielleicht am Abend im Bett nicht stehn, und dann wei√ü die Mutter
gleich, da√ü ich mit der Rosa und mit der Wetti was gemacht hab, und dann
schlagt sie mich.¬´

Und nun erz√§hlte er mir eine ganze Geschichte. Ich brauchte gar nicht
mehr hin- und herfragen. Es war ihm offenbar selbst ein Bed√ºrfnis, sich
mir anzuvertrauen. Seinen Vater hatte er nie gekannt, wu√üte sich seiner
auch kaum zu erinnern, denn der war gestorben, als Schani noch ein ganz
kleines Kind war. Seine Schwestern hatte ich oft gesehen. Seine Mutter
auch. Die Mutter war eine eher kleine, ganz magere Frau, noch nicht alt.
Und sie hatte so sch√∂ne schwarze Augen wie ihr Sohn. Rosa, die √§lteste,
war achtzehn Jahre alt, ein blondes schlankes M√§dchen, das wohl viel
Sommersprossen hatte, daf√ºr aber zwei harte, hoch aufstehende, spitze
Br√ºste, und Wetti, die j√ºngere, die sechzehn Jahre alt war und dick,
kurz, mit vollen jungen Br√ºsten und einem breiten Popo, da√ü ihr die
M√§nner auf der Stra√üe nachliefen. Wetti hatte angefangen. Sie war als
zw√∂lfj√§hriges Kind von einem Kolporteur, der mit Schauerromanen
hausieren ging, entjungfert worden, als er sie einmal allein zu Haus
traf. Der Mann hatte sie jedoch keineswegs vergewaltigt, sondern es war
eher anzunehmen, da√ü Wetti ihn verf√ºhrt hatte. Denn sie begann damals
eben sich zu entwickeln und schaute alle M√§nner mit verlockenden Augen
an.

Von diesem Abenteuer erz√§hlte sie ihrem Bruder, sie zeigte ihm, wie das
geschehen war, und die beiden spielten seither √∂fter ¬ªKolporteur¬´. Eines
Tages, als sie mitten im Kolporteurspielen waren, erwischte sie Rosa.
Sie blieb ganz ruhig vor ihnen stehen, und als die beiden erschrocken
auffuhren, sagte sie: ¬ªWas treibt ihr denn da?¬´ Nat√ºrlich bekam sie
keine Antwort. Wetti und Schani f√ºrchteten sich, die gro√üe Schwester
werde sie pr√ºgeln oder verraten. Es geschah aber nichts von alledem.
Rosa pr√ºgelte sie nicht und verriet sie nicht. Daf√ºr rief sie in der
Nacht, als die drei Geschwister, die in einem Zimmer beisammen
schliefen, schon im Bett lagen, Schani zu sich. Schani kam. ¬ªWas hast du
heute mit der Wetti getan?¬´ -- ¬ªNichts.¬´ -- ¬ªSo? wegen nichts hast du
ihr die R√∂cke aufgehoben, und die Duteln herausgenommen?¬´ -- ¬ªO, wir
haben uns nur gespielt¬†...¬´ -- ¬ªNa, so zeig mir, wie ihr euch gespielt
habt.¬´

Schani stand neben dem Bett im Finstern. Wetti schlief, im Kabinett
schlief die Mutter, und diese Zwiesprache ward fl√ºsternd gehalten. ¬ªZeig
mir, wie ihr euch gespielt habt¬†...¬´ Schani r√ºhrte sich nicht.

Da sagte Rosa: ¬ªKomm, leg dich zu mir¬†...¬´ und l√ºftete die Decke.

Als Schani zu seiner Schwester ins Bett geschl√ºpft war, merkte er, da√ü
sie kein Hemd anhatte, sondern nackt dalag. Er begann sofort mit ihren
Br√ºsten zu spielen, die ihm schon lang gefallen hatten. Und Rosa ergriff
seinen Schweif, sie streichelte ihn, pre√üte ihn und war so aufgeregt,
da√ü sie kaum zu sprechen vermochte. Auch Schani war ganz geil geworden,
dennoch hatte er Angst. Er hatte immer nur so bei Tag und in den
Kleidern mit Wetti gev√∂gelt, hatte als kleiner Bruder vor Rosa stets
einen gro√üen Respekt gehabt, und jetzt lag er da bei ihr im Bett, hielt
ihre harten, kugelf√∂rmigen, brennhei√üen Br√ºste in der Hand, und sie
spielte mit seinem Schweif.

¬ªHast du's schon oft mit der Wetti gemacht?¬´ fragte Rosa keuchend.

¬ªJa¬´, gestand Schani, ¬ªschon oft¬†...¬´

¬ªSoll ich's der Mutter erz√§hlen?¬´ drohte sie, und rieb dabei seinen
stehenden Schweif.

¬ªNein, nix sagen¬†...¬´, bat Schani.

Aber Rosa fuhr fort: ¬ªNa, jetzt liegst du sogar bei mir im Bett und tust
meine Duteln in die Hand nehmen und spielst mit deiner Nudel bei mir
herum. Wart nur, wenn ich das morgen der Mutter sag'¬†...¬´

Schani widersprach ihr: ¬ªO nein, das kannst du nicht sagen. Du hast mich
ja gerufen¬†...¬´

¬ªAn Schmarn hab' ich dich gerufen¬´, erkl√§rte Rosa, ¬ªdie Mutter glaubt ja
mir mehr als wie dir. Ich sag' ihr, du bist ins Bett zu mir gekommen und
hast mich v√∂geln wollen. Und ich sag' ihr, da√ü du die Wetti gev√∂gelt
hast¬†...¬´

Dabei dr√§ngte sie sich an ihn an und gab ihm selbst ihre Duteln zum
spielen. Schani wollte fort, aber sie hielt ihn beim Schweif fest.
¬ªBleib nur da -- du Tschapperl¬´, meinte sie, ¬ªich sag' ja nix. F√ºrcht
dich nicht. Ich will ja, da√ü du mir's auch machst. Komm.¬´

Schani schwang sich auf sie hinauf. Sie hatte ihm das Hemd in die H√∂he
geschoben, da√ü er ihren ganzen gl√ºhenden K√∂rper sp√ºrte. Sie spreizte die
F√º√üe auseinander und f√ºhrte seinen Schweif zu sich. Er sp√ºrte voll
Entz√ºcken ihre vollen warmen Schamlippen und den seidenweichen
Haarpolster dar√ºber. Er pre√üte seinen Schweif in ihre Fut. Rosa half
nach, aber sie war noch eine Jungfrau, und da ging die Sache doch nicht
so einfach. Schani stie√ü was er konnte, und Rosa st√∂hnte leise. Endlich
fa√üte sie ihn mit ausgestreckten H√§nden beim Popo und pre√üte sich ihn
bis ganz hinein. Schani sp√ºrte, wie ihr Fut langsam auseinanderging, und
es kam ihm auf der Stelle. Auch Rosa war von dem Ergebnis befriedigt und
schickte ihn auf sein Bett zur√ºck. Am n√§chsten Morgen sah Schani, da√ü
sein Hemd mit Blut befleckt sei, und Rosa erkl√§rte ihm, das k√§me von
ihrer Jungfernschaft.

Es dauerte nur kurze Zeit und Wetti entdeckte die n√§chtlichen Spiele
ihrer Geschwister. Sie schl√ºpfte zu ihnen, und nun unterhielten sie sich
zu dritt und Schani mu√üte herhalten. Mochte nun das blasse Aussehen des
Jungen der Mutter aufgefallen sein, oder mochte sie des Nachts etwas
geh√∂rt haben, genug sie pa√üte sch√§rfer auf, und als einmal Schani in
Rosas Bett eingeschlafen war, kam sie herein, weckte die drei und hie√ü
Schani in sein eigenes Bett gehen.

Am andern Tag in der Fr√ºh sagte sie: ¬ªDas geh√∂rt sich nicht, da√ü der
Bruder bei den Schwestern schl√§ft.¬´ Rosa fuhr gleich dazwischen und log:
¬ªDer Schani hat sich gef√ºrchtet.¬´ Aber die Mutter erkl√§rte: ¬ªWenn sich
der Bub f√ºrchtet, dann schl√§ft er von heute an bei mir, schon damit mir
das nicht mehr vorkommt, da√ü er bei seinen Schwestern liegt¬†...¬´

Schanis Bett wurde also richtig ins Kabinett gestellt, neben das der
Mutter, so da√ü er Seite an Seite mit ihr lag. Die Mutter kam nun in der
Nacht zu ihm, dr√ºckte ihn an sich, damit er sich nicht f√ºrchten solle.
Sie nahm seine H√§nde, legte sie sich auf die Br√ºste, und Schani spielte
damit, bis er einschlief. Diese Br√ºste waren nicht so voll und rund wie
die seiner Schwestern, aber doch noch fest genug. Das ging so einige
N√§chte, bis Schani mutiger wurde, und sich enger an die Mutter
schmiegte, da√ü sie merkte, wie ihm die Nudel stand. Sie sp√ºrte den
harten kleinen Schweif an ihrer Lende und zuckte zur√ºck. Aber sie w√ºhlte
ihm dabei ihre Br√ºste noch fester in die H√§nde, und Schani h√∂rte wie sie
keuchte. Wieder vergingen in diesem Spiel ein paar N√§chte. Schani schob
seinen Schwanz an den nackten Schenkel. Sie fuhr jedesmal davor zur√ºck,
sagte wohl auch hie und da leise: ¬ªNicht!¬´, aber sie dr√§ngte ihm ihre
Brust auf, so da√ü seine Erregung immer h√∂her stieg. Nach zehn oder zw√∂lf
N√§chten lie√ü sie seinen Schwanz an ihrem Schenkel liegen, und langsam,
langsam fuhr sie mit der Hand herunter, fa√üte ihn und streichelte ihn
leise. Endlich warf sie sich auf Schani, nahm seinen Schweif, und auf
ihrem Buben reitend stie√ü sie sich die Nudel hinein, beugte sich vor,
und pre√üte ihren Busen an sein Gesicht. ¬ªNa, sto√ü! Sto√ü!¬´ √§chzte sie,
¬ªdie Mutter erlaubt's dir! Sto√ü nur! Fest! Fester!¬´

Schani erz√§hlte, wie er jede Nacht von da ab seine Mutter gev√∂gelt
hatte. Einmal von unten, dann oben liegend. Manchmal drei- oder viermal,
immer aber mu√üte er zwei Nummern machen. Bei Tag liefen ihm die
Schwestern nach, die es ja bald belauscht hatten, was im Kabinett der
Mutter vorging und die nun keine Scheu mehr kannten. Es gab keine
Tageszeit, wo er nicht schon eine seiner Schwestern oder die Mutter
hatte v√∂geln m√ºssen. Keine Stellung, in der er es nicht schon getan
hatte, kein Winkel in der ganzen Wohnung, der nicht schon hatte
herhalten m√ºssen, auf dem Sofa, auf den Sesseln, auf dem Tisch, auf der
K√ºchenbank, auf dem Fu√üboden, √ºberall bediente er, in allen Stellungen,
die drei Weiber, von denen jede ihm sofort nach dem Schweif griff, wenn
sie ihn nur allein erwischte. Die beiden Schwestern genierten sich
voreinander l√§ngst nicht mehr, weil sie gegen ihre Mutter
zusammenhielten. Waren die beiden Schwestern ohne die Mutter, dann
lie√üen sie sich von ihrem Bruder v√∂geln, schauten einander zu und nahmen
seinen Schwanz in den Mund, damit er ohne Pause nach einer Minute wieder
steif werde, ehe sie gest√∂rt w√ºrden. Auch die Mutter behalf sich mit dem
Schlecken, um seine Leistungsf√§higkeit zu erh√∂hen, trotzdem merkte sie
bald, da√ü der Schani anderweitig geschw√§cht werde. Es kam zu einem
Riesenskandal zwischen den drei Weibern, die es aber zuletzt doch f√ºr
geraten fanden, sich friedlich in dem Knaben zu teilen. Oft wurde Schani
nun, kaum er bei seiner Mutter gev√∂gelt hatte, zu den Schwestern
gerufen, und die Mutter lie√ü ihn gehen, oder Rosa oder Wetti erschienen
im Kabinett und holten sich dort gleich ihre Befriedigung, und die
Mutter sah zu, und zwang den Buben dann, wenn er die Runde durch alle
drei Fummeln beendigt hatte zu einem vierten Fick, weil das Zuschauen
sie geil gemacht hatte. Sie hatte nichts mehr dagegen, da√ü ihre M√§dchen
sich an den n√§chtlichen Orgien beteiligten, nur wenn sie den Buben bei
Tage verbrauchten und ihm seine Kraft f√ºr die Nacht nahmen, wurde sie
b√∂se und schlug ihn, sooft sie es entdeckte. -- Schani erz√§hlte mir
diese Dinge und erz√ºrnte sich dabei wegen der ¬ªverfluchten drei
Frauenzimmer¬´, die ihm, wie er mir sagte, alle schon zuwider seien. Ich
h√∂rte ihm begierig zu, und je l√§nger er sprach, desto aufgeregter wurde
ich. Wiederholt machte ich w√§hrend seiner Erz√§hlung den Versuch, seines
Schwanzes habhaft zu werden, um damit zu spielen, aber er wehrte mich
immer in aller Sanftmut ab. Endlich hob ich meine R√∂cke, zog seine Hand
herbei, und lie√ü mir an der Fut von ihm Finger√ºbungen machen, um doch
beim Zuh√∂ren dort einigerma√üen besch√§ftigt zu sein. Es half nichts; denn
Schani sprach und sprach, und seine Finger wurden, wenn er kaum ein
bi√üchen gespielt hatte, wieder unbeweglich. Ich geriet aber mehr und
mehr in Wollust und Verlangen, und als endlich drau√üen die T√ºre ge√∂ffnet
ward, und unser Beisammensein unterbrochen wurde, zitterte ich vor
Geilheit und Schrecken.

Es war Herr Ekhard, der nach Hause kam. Kaum erblickte ich ihn, als ich
mein ganzes Verlangen ihm entgegenwarf. Der wird mich jetzt v√∂geln,
dachte ich, und ich verabschiedete Schani mit solcher Eile, da√ü er ganz
verwundert dar√ºber war. Dann lief ich eilig in die K√ºche zu Herrn
Ekhard. Ich hatte lange nichts mit ihm zu tun gehabt, war ihm eher
ausgewichen, und seit mich der Herr Horak im Keller unten gev√∂gelt hatte
und Alois im Scho√ü seiner Klementine, war mir Herr Ekhard nicht mehr so
wichtig.

In diesem Augenblick aber schaute ich nun wieder nach ihm. Er erschien
mir in meiner momentanen Not wie eine Erl√∂sung. Ich erinnerte mich an
seinen Schweif, und war doch zugleich neugierig, ihn zu sehen. Ich
erinnerte mich gewisser Griffe von seinen H√§nden, gewisser Liebkosungen,
und dabei dachte ich an Schanis Mutter und Schwestern, die ich nicht
wenig beneidete, weil sie immer eine Nudel hatten, sooft sie sie
wollten. Und ich verga√ü v√∂llig, da√ü ich ja meinen Bruder Franz besa√ü,
der mich immer, sooft ich es noch verlangt hatte, v√∂gelte. Aber wie lang
war dies nicht geschehen. Ich dachte gar nicht mehr an Franz, er
interessierte mich nicht.

Ich lief also in die K√ºche, lief direkt auf den Herrn Ekhard zu, und ehe
er noch Zeit hatte, mich zu begr√º√üen, war ich schon mit der einen Hand
in seinem Hosent√ºrl, w√ºhlte in seinem Hemd nach dem Schwanz, mit der
andern umschlang ich seinen Hals und fl√ºsterte ihm ins Ohr: ¬ªRasch!
Rasch! Es kann wer kommen.¬´

Herr Ekhard war augenblicklich von meiner Geilheit ergriffen, das f√ºhlte
ich, weil sein Schweif in meiner Hand sich blitzartig aufrichtete, und
in einer Sekunde ganz hei√ü wurde. Trotzdem fragte er: ¬ªWas denn --
rasch? Was willst du denn?¬´

Ich hatte keine Scheu. Er hatte gefragt, weil er das Wort aus meinem
Mund zu h√∂ren w√ºnschte. Ich sp√ºrte den geilen Wunsch in seiner Frage,
geriet noch mehr in Aufregung und z√∂gerte nicht: ¬ªV√∂geln will ich,
schnell v√∂geln.¬´

Herr Ekhard zitterte. Er warf sich auf mich, wie ich so vor ihm stand,
und wir w√§ren beide auf die Erde zu liegen gekommen. Aber das wollte ich
nicht. Ich zog ihn ins Zimmer; an seinem Schwanz zog ich ihn nach, und
warf mich dort aufs Bett. Bleischwer sank er auf meine Brust, und sein
Schweif tobte gegen meine Fut. Er h√§tte mich damals wahrscheinlich ganz
auseinandergesprengt, wenn ich ihn h√§tte gew√§hren lassen.

Doch ich fing seinen Schwanz mit der Hand auf, und lenkte ihn. Mit der
rechten Hand bildete ich einen Schlauch, in dem er hin- und herwetzen
konnte, wie in einer Fummel, und nur die Eichel, die lange, spitze
Eichel, die er hatte, lie√ü ich zu mir ein. Sie spreizte mich ganz, so
dick war sie. Aber sie entfachte mich zum h√∂chsten Genie√üen: so warm und
gut kam sie zu mir.

Herr Ekhard vollf√ºhrte so heftige St√∂√üe, da√ü ich seine Eier gegen meine
Hand, die den Schwanz hielt, anschlagen sp√ºrte. Ich war ganz hingerissen
und begriff nicht, wie ich noch einen andern Mann hatte dr√ºber lassen
k√∂nnen als ihn. Und ich kam in Extase: ¬ªV√∂geln Sie mich nur¬†...,
gut¬†..., gut¬†..., gut¬†...¬´, rief ich ihm zu. ¬ªV√∂geln, pudern, stemmen
Sie mich.¬´ Und dabei f√ºhlte ich in der Hand die Pulse von seiner Nudel,
und f√ºhlte in mir seine Eichel zucken. Ekhard schnaufte besinnungslos,
und auf einmal sp√ºrte ich wie eine Sturzwelle seinen Samen sich
ergie√üen.

Ich hatte ein wenig nur gekostet vom Vergn√ºgen. Genug war mir diese eine
Nummer ganz und gar nicht. Ekhard aber sa√ü ersch√∂pft da und lie√ü sich
von mir abtrocknen. Ich wollte ihm das beibringen, was ich von Herrn
Horak gelernt hatte. Ich wollte, da√ü er mich, so tief es ging, in den
Arsch v√∂geln solle. Deshalb begann ich wieder mit seiner Nudel zu
spielen. Ich nahm sie erst zwischen zwei Finger, wie ich es von
Klementine gesehen hatte und tippte mit dem Zeigefinger an seine
Vorhaut. Und als das nicht viel half, begann ich kurz entschlossen mit
der Schleckerei. Ich nahm den weichen Schwanz ganz in den Mund und warf
ihn darin mit der Zunge hin und her. Mit den H√§nden w√ºhlte ich
unterdessen in den langen schwarzen Schweifhaaren, die mich in die Augen
kitzelten, oder ich streichelte seine Hoden, und dabei wartete ich voll
Aufregung darauf, da√ü der Schwanz gr√∂√üer und gr√∂√üer werden solle, was er
denn auch bei so guter Behandlung bald genug tat. Endlich stand er
wieder ganz stramm in der H√∂he. Ekhard wollte nach mir greifen, um die
zweite Nummer abzumachen, aber ich umhalste ihn und sagte ihm ins Ohr:
¬ªWollen Sie ihn nicht tiefer hineinstecken?¬´

¬ªJa! Ja!¬´ schnappte er. ¬ªTiefer ... Aber wie denn, es geht ja nicht.¬´
Und dabei w√ºhlte er mit seinen H√§nden unter meinen R√∂cken herum und
stie√ü mir den Finger so fest in die Fut, da√ü ich beinahe aufgeschrien
h√§tte. Ich dr√§ngte ihn fort: ¬ªSo nicht¬†..., aber es geht¬†...¬´

¬ªWie denn? Wie denn?¬´ wollte er wissen.

Ich kehrte ihm den R√ºcken zu, b√ºckte mich, und zwischen meine Beine
hindurchlangend schob ich seinen Schweif zu meinem Popo. Herr Ekhard
grunzte wie ein Schwein, w√§hrend seine von meinem Speichel glitschrig
gemachte Nudel langsam in meinen Hintern eindrang. Immer tiefer und
tiefer bohrte er mich an, viel tiefer, wie mir schien, als es dem Herrn
Horak je gelungen war. Ich f√ºhlte mich so sch√∂n ausgef√ºllt, da√ü mir
nichts mehr zu w√ºnschen √ºbrigblieb, als wie seine Finger in meiner Fut
kitzeln zu sp√ºren. Und ich holte mir diese Finger. Aber Herr Ekhard war
so wild vor Geilheit, da√ü er mir meine Spalte blutig gerissen h√§tte. Ich
zog den Popo zusammen, und Herr Ekhard st√∂hnte laut auf vor Wonne. Weil
mir das Freude machte, ihn so auf√§chzen zu h√∂ren, zog ich alle
Augenblick den Popo zusammen. Das hatte zur Folge, da√ü mich fr√ºher, als
es mir lieb sein konnte, sein Same durchrieselte.

Ganz ersch√∂pft lehnte er gegen die Wand, indem ich mich wieder
emporrichtete. Aber ich war noch so erf√ºllt von der Empfindung, seinen
Schwanz bei mir zu haben, da√ü ich mich vor Wollust sch√ºttelte, und der
Saft, den Herr Ekhard mir gelassen, und der jetzt in d√ºnnen Schn√ºrchen
zum Popo herausgelaufen kam, kitzelte mich.

Ich lie√ü nicht von ihm ab, und machte mir, unter dem Vorwand, ihn
abzuwischen, wieder an seinem Schweif zu schaffen. Als ich seine Vorhaut
auf und niederzog, sagte er matt: ¬ªGeh, la√ü mich.¬´

Allein ich hatte noch nicht genug. Mir kam immer Schani, seine Mutter
und seine beiden Schwestern in den Sinn, und ich fragte: ¬ªSagen Sie,
haben Sie schon einmal nackt gev√∂gelt?¬´

Noch nie hatte ich bis dahin so ungeniert und aufrichtig mit Herrn
Ekhard gesprochen.

Er meinte: ¬ªAber du bist ja selbst schon bei mir im Bett gewesen.¬´

Worauf ich erwiderte: ¬ªJa, aber ganz nackt, ohne Hemd¬†...?¬´

Er fragte: ¬ªHast denn du das schon getan¬†...?¬´

¬ªNein¬´, sagte ich, ¬ªaber ich m√∂cht' es einmal tun. Haben Sie's schon
gemacht?¬´

Er l√§chelte: ¬ªNat√ºrlich. Ich bin ja verheiratet gewesen.¬´

¬ªIst Ihre Frau gestorben?¬´

¬ªNein, gestorben ist sie nicht.¬´

¬ªWo ist sie denn?¬´

¬ªNa, eine Hur ist sie geworden.¬´

Ich erinnerte mich, da√ü mich der Herr Horak so genannt hatte und fragte:
¬ªBin ich vielleicht auch eine Hur?¬´

¬ªO nein¬´, er lachte heftig √ºber diese Frage. ¬ªDu bist meine liebe kleine
Peperl.¬´

Und dabei dr√ºckte er mich an sich, und ich ben√ºtzte die Gelegenheit,
wieder mit seinem Schweif zu spielen.

¬ªSo ein kleines M√§del wie du hab' ich noch nie gefickt¬´, meinte er,
¬ªschmeckt dir denn das V√∂geln so gut¬†...?¬´

Ich neigte mich statt aller Antwort herunter und nahm leise seinen
Schwanz in den Mund. Ich leckte mit der Zungenspitze die Eichel, fuhr
den ganzen Schaft herunter, k√º√üte seine Eier und lie√ü mich von den
Haaren im Gesicht kitzeln. Aber sein Schwanz blieb weich. Ich suzelte
und suzelte, und er sagte nur manchmal: ¬ªDas tut wohl¬†...¬´

Dann zog er seine Nudel aus meinem Mund und lie√ü mich zwischen seine
Beine treten. Er hob mir die R√∂cke auf, und mit der Hand wischte er
seinen schlappen Schweif an meiner Fut herum und kitzelte mich wie mit
einer dicken Zunge.

¬ªIst das gut?¬´ meinte er.

¬ªJa, aber warum steht er Ihnen nicht?¬´ gab ich zur√ºck. ¬ªIch m√∂cht', da√ü
er Ihnen wieder steht¬†...¬´

¬ªWenn das deine Mutter w√º√üt', was du da tust¬†...¬´, sagte er pl√∂tzlich.

Ich lachte: ¬ªDie Mutter will auch, da√ü er dem Vater √∂fter steht¬†...¬´

Er wurde aufmerksam: ¬ªWoher wei√üt du das?¬´

Ich erz√§hlte ihm, w√§hrend er mit seiner weichen Nudel an meiner Spalte
herumstrich, die n√§chtliche Szene, die ich belauscht hatte.

Er h√∂rte gespannt zu: ¬ªSo -- also das hat sie gesagt, da√ü sie jemanden
andern zum V√∂geln finden wird¬†...?¬´

Und auf einmal stand ihm der Schweif so fest wie fr√ºher. Er hob mich
auf, da√ü ich mich auf ihn setzen konnte, und so hielt er mich in den
Armen und dr√ºckte nun seine Schwanzspitze hinein, so weit er konnte. Ich
tauchte auf und nieder und mir kam es rasch nacheinander, was ich ihm
auch sagte: ¬ªMir kommt's¬†..., jetzt¬†..., jetzt¬†..., nicht so tief, das
tut weh¬†..., jetzt¬†..., so¬†..., so¬†..., jetzt kommt's schon wieder¬†...¬´

Er fragte dazwischen: ¬ªWarum will sich deine Mutter nicht von mir v√∂geln
lassen?¬´

Ich schob auf der Schwanzspitze hin und her und meinte: ¬ªIch wei√ü
nicht¬†...¬´

Er fuhr fort: ¬ªIch werde deiner Mutter sagen, da√ü sie's tun soll¬†...,
ja?¬´

¬ªMeinetwegen¬´, gab ich zur Antwort: ¬ª...¬†mir kommt's wieder¬†..., ah¬†...,
ah¬†..., das Pudern ist gut¬†..., gut¬†..., ist das¬†...¬´

Er v√∂gelte mich jetzt wunderbar, aber er dachte nur an das, was ich ihm
erz√§hlt hatte, und ich dachte wieder nur an Schanis Mutter und
Schwestern.

¬ªGlaubst, da√ü sie sich von mir v√∂geln l√§√üt?¬´ fragte er keuchend.
¬ªVielleicht¬†..., ich wei√ü nicht¬†...¬´, gab ich ihm zur Antwort, und weil
er heftiger zu sto√üen begann, bat ich ihn: ¬ªnicht so tief¬†...¬´

¬ªBei deiner Mutter ginge er ganz hinein, ... was?¬´

¬ªNat√ºrlich¬†...¬´

¬ªM√∂chst du's haben, da√ü ich sie v√∂gel¬†...?¬´

Aus Gef√§lligkeit sagte ich: ¬ªJa¬†...¬´ Und im selben Moment spritzte er
mich an. Ich fuhr weg von ihm. Aber er war noch nicht fertig und wurde
b√∂se.

¬ªBleib doch, du Fratz, du dummer¬†..., es kommt mir erst, sapperment¬†...,
mitten drin darf man ja nicht fort¬†...¬´

Ich wichste ihm den Rest mit der Hand herunter, und es regte mich wieder
auf, wie hoch er spritzte; es wollte gar kein Ende nehmen.

Mittlerweile war es finster geworden. Ich legte mich zu Bett, und Herr
Ekhard tat in der K√ºche dasselbe. Nach einer Weile aber lief ich zu ihm,
zog das Hemd ab und trat nackt an sein Lager.

Er wollte mich zuerst nicht haben, aber er streichelte mich doch am
ganzen K√∂rper, k√º√üte mich auf die Brustwarzen, was mir sehr wohl tat.
Dann fuhr er mir mit angefeuchteten Fingerspitzen √ºber Brust und Bauch
hinunter in meine Muschel, da√ü ich ganz au√üer mir geriet vor Geilheit.

Ich f√ºrchtete, es k√∂nne jemand nach Hause kommen, ehe das Spiel zu Ende
gespielt sei, deshalb bat ich ihn: ¬ªGehn S' Herr Ekhard, tummeln Sie
sich, es k√∂nnt' wer kommen.¬´

¬ªWas denn tummeln?¬´ fragte er.

¬ªMit dem V√∂geln¬†...¬´, fl√ºsterte ich ihm zu.

¬ªNa h√∂rst du!¬´ Er setzte sich im Bett auf, hielt mich quer auf seinen
Knien, und suchte im Finstern mein Gesicht zu ersp√§hen.

¬ªNa h√∂rst du¬†..., dreimal hab' ich dir's getan, und jetzt willst du's
wieder¬†...?¬´

¬ªNackt¬†...¬´, sagte ich sch√ºchtern.

¬ªSchau dir doch einmal deine Fut an¬´, meinte er, ¬ªdie ist ja ganz
ausgewetzt von heut abend¬†...!¬´

¬ªO das ist nicht von heute¬´, entschl√ºpfte es mir.

¬ªSo? Von wann denn?¬´ Er war mit dem Finger in mein Loch geglitten, und
das brachte mich ganz in Aufregung. ¬ªSo? Von wann ist das denn? Mit wem
v√∂gelst du denn so herum? Na? Mir scheint, du treibst es aber zu viel?
Sag mir mit wem?¬´

Er bohrte mit seinem Finger an mir herum, und ich war wie von Sinnen.
Trotzdem √ºberlegte ich blitzschnell meine Antwort und beschlo√ü, den
Herrn Horak zu verraten. Das war auch ein Erwachsener.

¬ªAlso wer hat das so ausgewetzt?¬´ fragte er tief √ºber mich gebeugt,
heiser vor Neugierde und mit den Fingern in meiner Fut w√ºhlend. ¬ªWer?
Das mu√üt' mir jetzt sagen¬†...¬´

¬ªDer Horak¬†...¬´, antwortete ich.

Er wollte alles wissen: ¬ªDer Bierversilberer von unten?¬´

¬ªJa.¬´

¬ªSeit wann?¬´

¬ªSchon lang.¬´

¬ªFr√ºher als ich dich gev√∂gelt hab'?¬´

¬ªNein, sp√§ter¬†...¬´

¬ªWo denn? Wo hat er dich denn erwischt¬†...?¬´

¬ªIm Keller¬†...¬´

¬ªNa, und wieso hat er dich so ausgewetzt¬†...?¬´

¬ªWeil er so einen langen Schweif hat¬†...¬´

¬ªWie lang? L√§nger als meiner¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa, viel l√§nger, aber nicht so dick.¬´

¬ªUnd wie oft v√∂gelt er dich auf einmal¬†...?¬´

Ich log: ¬ªF√ºnfmal macht er mir's immer¬†...¬´

Ekhard war ganz aufgeregt: ¬ªKomm¬´, keuchte er pl√∂tzlich, ¬ªkomm, ich
werd' dich noch einmal pudern.¬´

Ich schl√ºpfte unter ihn, er drehte sich vor, hob sich das Hemd auf und
lag nun nackt auf meinem nackten kleinen K√∂rper. Aber es ging nicht.
Sein Schweif war ganz weich und wollte nicht stehen.

¬ªVerflucht¬´, fl√ºsterte er, ¬ªund ich m√∂cht' wirklich¬†...¬´

¬ªIch auch¬´, gab ich zur√ºck, und b√§umte mich ihm entgegen. Aber es half
nichts.

¬ªWei√üt was¬´, meinte er, ¬ªnimm ihn wieder in den Mund, da steht er
gleich¬†...¬´

Ich versuchte noch immer mit der Hand da unten nachzuhelfen und mir den
weichen Zumpel hereinzustopfen. Aber er wiederholte: ¬ªNimm ihn wieder in
'n Mund¬†..., den Horak seinen wirst ja auch suzeln, was?¬´

¬ªJa¬†...¬´, gestand ich.

Ekhard rutschte an mir herauf, und als ich verstand, was er wollte,
rutschte ich im Bett tiefer, bis er, immer auf mir liegend, seinen
Schwanz an meine Lippen brachte. So machte ich wieder, und in dieser
Stellung besonders deutlich, meinen Mund zur Fut. Denn Ekhard schob mir
seine Nudel ganz in die Lippen. Sein Bauch lag auf meinem Gesicht, da√ü
ich kaum Luft bekam. Dennoch arbeitete ich, wie ich nur konnte, weil die
Angst, von meinen heimkehrenden Leuten gest√∂rt zu werden, mich peinigte.
Er hatte seinen Kopf in den Polster vergraben, st√∂hnte leise und hob
sein Ges√§√ü, als ob er v√∂geln w√ºrde. Ich lag unter ihm und sog und
schleckte und z√ºngelte an seinem Schweif, der mir im Mund hin- und
herging. Das dauerte eine ganze Weile. Der Schwei√ü brach mir aus, und
die Lippen schmerzten mich. Endlich, endlich f√ºhlte ich den Speer sich
aufrichten, f√ºhlte ihn rund, steif, hart, gro√ü werden. Endlich ging er
nicht mehr ganz in meinen Mund hinein, endlich sp√ºrte ich, wie er zu
pulsieren begann.

Wie eine Eidechse glitt ich unter Ekhard h√∂her, bis der warme Stiel
zwischen meinen Beinen lag. Dort haschte ich ihn mit den H√§nden und
vergrub ihn in meine Fut, so weit er nur darin Platz hatte. Das drau√üen
bleibende St√ºck, es war der gr√∂√üere Teil, hielt ich in beiden H√§nden
sanft umklammert und freute mich, wie er hin und herging.

Ekhard v√∂gelte mich mit einer wahren Wut: ¬ªDas h√§tt' ich nicht
geglaubt¬´, schnaufte er, ¬ªdas h√§tt' ich nicht geglaubt, da√ü wir noch
eine Nummer machen.¬´

¬ªBesser sto√üen¬´, bat ich, ¬ªbesser sto√üen.¬´

¬ªNa wart¬´, raunte er mir zu, ¬ªich will dich ficken, da√ü du die Engel
singen h√∂rst¬†..., na wart¬†...¬´

Er legte mir die H√§nde auf die Brust und spielte mit nassen
Fingerspitzen an meinen Brustwarzen, da√ü mir wonnige Schauer bis in die
Fu√üsohlen herunter liefen.

Ich warf meine Fut seinem Schweif entgegen, lie√ü mit den H√§nden ein
bi√üchen nach, und f√ºhlte wie er tiefer eindrang.

¬ªWart¬´, sagte er jetzt, ¬ªdu Hur, du nichtsnutzige, du Fratz, du geiler,
du Petschierm√§del, du l√§ufiges, wart nur du Hure du, ich werd's dir
zeigen¬†...¬´

Und er pre√üte seinen Mund an mein Ohr und begann mir die Ohrmuschel
auszuschlecken. Im selben Moment war mir, als ob ich losschreien m√º√üte.
Mir war, als ob er mit sechs Schw√§nzen mich v√∂geln w√ºrde, in der Fut, im
Mund, in den beiden Ohren, und auf den beiden Brustwarzen. Ich hielt das
laute Schreien mit M√ºhe zur√ºck, aber reden mu√üte ich: ¬ªJessas, Herr
Ekhard¬†..., das ist gut¬†..., das ist gut¬†..., ich werd' mich immer nur
von Ihnen v√∂geln lassen¬†..., immer nur von Ihnen¬†..., Jessas mir
kommt's¬†..., mir kommt's¬†..., ganz tief herein¬†..., so¬†...¬´ Ich lie√ü ihn
wieder ein St√ºckchen mehr zu mir, es tat schon weh, aber ich achtete
nicht darauf.

¬ªWart nur¬´, fl√ºsterte Ekhard an meinem Ohr, indem er zwischen seinen
Worten mit der Zunge in meiner Ohrmuschel herumfuhr: ¬ªWart nur, dir
werd' ich das Pudern beibringen¬†..., du wirst mir nicht mehr in Keller
gehen¬†..., mit dem Bierversilberer auf'n Fa√ül pudern¬†..., wart nur¬†...,
dich v√∂gel' ich jetzt, wie ich meine Frau gev√∂gelt hab'¬†..., so¬†...,
so¬†..., und wenn du gleich ein Kind kriegst¬†..., das geniert mich
nicht¬†..., sto√ü nur zu¬†..., so¬†..., mir entgegensto√üen¬†..., was?
G'sp√ºrst es¬†..., ja?¬´

Ich war so aufgel√∂st, da√ü ich immerfort sprach und ihm Antwort gab:
¬ªNein, Herr Ekhard¬†..., nein¬†..., ich geh' nicht mehr in' Keller¬†...,
ich lass' mich nicht ... mehr von Horak v√∂geln ... nein¬†..., von niemand
mehr, ... nur von Ihnen¬†..., von Ihnen ganz allein, ... von Alois nicht
mehr¬†..., und nicht mehr vom Franzl¬†..., und von Robert nicht mehr, ...
und von kein Soldaten auch nicht mehr, ... nur von Ihnen¬†...!¬´

¬ªSo viel Schw√§nze hast du schon drin gehabt¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬´, sagte ich, ¬ªso viel Schw√§nze¬†..., und noch viel mehr¬†..., noch ein
Haufen anderer Buben¬†...¬´

Er v√∂gelte drauf los wie im Sturm. ¬ªAlsdann brauch' ich mich nicht
genieren¬†..., mich wirst nicht verraten.¬´

¬ªNein, Herr Ekhard¬´, stammelte ich in Ekstase¬†..., ¬ªIhnen nicht! Aber
Sie m√ºssen mich alle Tag so v√∂geln¬†..., ah so gut¬†..., so gut ist der
Schwanz in der Fut¬†..., ah, es kommt mir schon wieder¬†..., es kommt
mir¬†..., nur so weiter sto√üen¬†..., nur so weiter¬†..., nur fest¬†...¬´

¬ªWann was g'schieht¬´, sagte er, ¬ªdann sagst du, da√ü es der Horak
war¬†..., verstehst¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa, aber Sie m√ºssen mich alle Tag v√∂geln¬†..., alle Tag¬†..., ah¬†...,
ah¬†...¬´

¬ªMein' letzten Baaz geb ich her¬´, rief er, ¬ªsoll sein was will, ich
werd' dich schon so ausv√∂geln, da√ü der Schweif noch ganz hineingeht¬†...¬´

Und dann remmelten wir wortlos weiter im Takt. Meine H√§nde brannten,
meine Fut brannte, meine Ohren sausten, mein Atem versagte. Ekhard
puderte weiter wie eine Maschine.

Mehr als eine Stunde dauerte diese Nummer. Ich r√ºhrte mich nicht mehr,
und hie und da wagte ich die Frage: ¬ªNoch nicht bald fertig¬†...?¬´

¬ªNein¬†...¬´, keuchte er.

Und weiter remmelte sein Schweif. In mir war alles vorbei. Die letzten
Male, da es mir noch gekommen war, hatte ich eher Schmerz als Wonne
gef√ºhlt. Es hatte nur fl√ºchtig in mir gezuckt, und wie ein rascher
Krampf war es mir in die Zehenspitzen gefahren und hatte mich gestreckt.
Dann aber sp√ºrte ich nur den Brand meiner halb wund geriebenen Haut.

¬ªNoch nicht¬†...?¬´

¬ªBald.¬´

Nach einer Weile: ¬ªBitt sch√∂n, Herr Ekhard, es tut mir schon weh.¬´

¬ªGleich, mein Mauserl¬†..., kommt's dir nicht noch einmal?¬´

¬ªNein¬†..., es kommt mir gar nicht mehr.... Bitt sch√∂n, spritzen Sie Herr
Ekhard¬†..., spritzen Sie¬†...¬´

Er machte einen solchen Sto√ü, da√ü ich glaubte, er sprenge mir die Fut
auseinander. Und dann begann er zu spritzen. Es rann mir so in meine
Spalte hinein und quietschend wieder heraus, als ob er uriniere. Das
ganze Bett war na√ü, so flo√ü der Samen aus seiner R√∂hre. Dabei lag er
ganz still und wie ein Klotz so schwer auf mir und r√∂chelte.

Ich wand mich, als er fertig war, unter ihm hervor, halbtot vor
M√ºdigkeit. Er stie√ü nach mir und brummte: ¬ªSchau aber jetzt, da√ü du
weiterkommst, du Hurenfratz du vermaledeiter¬†...¬´

Ich gab ihm gar keine Antwort, sondern trat nackt wie ich war ins
Zimmer, zog das Hemd an und warf mich auf mein Bett. Mir brannte meine
Muschel inwendig und an ihren √§u√üeren R√§ndern wie Feuer. Ich glaubte,
ich m√ºsse voll Wunden sein, z√ºndete ein Licht an und besah mich mittels
eines Handspiegels. Wund oder blutig war ich allerdings nicht, aber ich
erschrak doch, wie rot die Fut war, wie weit sie klaffte und wie weh mir
alles tat.

Ich legte mich hin, blies das Licht aus. Zwei Minuten sp√§ter kamen meine
Leute. Ich tat als ob ich schliefe, verbi√ü meinen Hunger, indessen sie
ihr Nachtmahl verzehrten, und sp√§ter schlief ich wirklich ein.

Am n√§chsten Morgen war Herr Ekhard krank. Er lag in der K√ºche im Bett,
legte sich kalte Umschl√§ge auf den Kopf, und wie ich glaube auch
anderswohin. Ich war ganz wohl, nur die Fut brannte mich noch ein wenig.
Ekhard sah mich nicht an, und auch ich vermied es, mit ihm zu reden. Er
schlief √ºbrigens beinahe den ganzen Tag. Als ich abends bei ihm
vorbeiging, zischelte er mir zu: ¬ªDa bist du schuld!¬´

Ich bekam eine pl√∂tzliche Angst und lief ins Zimmer, wo meine Mutter
war, und es gab mir keine Ruhe, ich mu√üte sie fragen: ¬ªWas fehlt denn
dem Herrn Ekhard?¬´

¬ªIch wei√ü nicht¬´, erwiderte sie gleichg√ºltig, ¬ªkrank ist er halt.¬´

Wenige Minuten sp√§ter ging sie in die K√ºche, und ich h√∂rte sie fragen:
¬ªWas fehlt Ihnen denn eigentlich, Herr Ekhard¬†...?¬´

Ich erschrak furchtbar, weil ich nicht anders meinte, als da√ü er jetzt
sagen werde, ¬ªdie Pepi ist dran schuld¬†...¬´

Er fl√ºsterte etwas, das ich nicht verstand, und ich vernahm nur, wie die
Mutter sagte: ¬ªGehn S', h√∂ren S' auf.¬´

Vorsichtig schlich ich zur T√ºr, um zu horchen. Ich mu√üte, koste es was
es wolle, ich mu√üte h√∂ren, was vorging.

Ekhard fl√ºsterte in seinem Ba√ü, und die Mutter sagte auch schon leiser:
¬ªAber warum tun S' denn so was?¬´

Er antwortete fl√ºsternd: ¬ªDas Madl hat mich so aufgeregt, sag' ich
Ihnen, ich bin ein ganzer Narr g'wesen¬†...¬´

Ich war vor Angst mehr tot als lebendig.

Meine Mutter sagte: ¬ªDas mu√ü aber ein sauberes Luder g'wesen sein¬†...¬´

Ekhard widersprach: ¬ªNein, nein, sie ist noch ein Kind, die wei√ü ja
selbst nicht, was sie anstellt, die ist vielleicht so alt wie Ihre
Pepi¬†...¬´

Jetzt atmete ich auf.

Aber meine Mutter schlug die H√§nde zusammen: ¬ªUnd da traun Sie sich und
tun so ein Kind sch√§nden¬†...¬´

Ekhard lachte: ¬ªAch was, sch√§nden! Sch√§nden! Wenn sie mir selber den
Schwanz aus dem Hosent√ºrl herausnimmt, wenn sie selber mir die Nudel in'
Mund nimmt und abschleckt, dann werd' ich sie wohl nicht gesch√§ndet
haben.¬´

Meine Mutter war entsetzt: ¬ªNein, wie die Kinder schlecht sind¬†..., da
sieht man, man kann nicht genug aufpassen.¬´

Dann senkte sie ihre Stimme v√∂llig zum Fl√ºstern herab, und ich entnahm
nur aus seiner Antwort, was sie gefragt haben mochte. Herr Ekhard wurde
lebhafter und meinte: ¬ªAber nein, wo wird er denn ganz hereingehen¬†...
Nur so weit, nur so ein St√ºckerl, ... geben S' die Hand her, ich zeig's
Ihnen¬†...¬´

¬ªNein, nein, ich dank' sch√∂n¬†..., was f√§llt Ihnen denn ein?¬´

¬ªNa, da w√§r' auch nix dabei¬´, meinte Herr Ekhard.

Die Mutter unterbrach ihn: ¬ªWie oft ham S' g'sagt?¬´

¬ªSechsmal¬†...¬´ Herr Ekhard log und es machte mir Spa√ü, da√ü ich es wu√üte
und da√ü die Mutter keine Ahnung davon hatte. ¬ªSechsmal hab' ich's
petschieren m√ºssen¬´, fuhr er fort, ¬ªdie hat's nicht anders getan¬†...¬´ --
¬ªGehn S' mir weg¬†...¬´, fiel meine Mutter ein. ¬ªDas gibt's ja gar nicht,
sechsmal ... Was l√ºgen S' denn so daher¬†...¬´

¬ªWenn ich Ihnen aber sag'¬´, beteuerte Ekhard, ¬ªSie sehen doch, da√ü ich
mich nicht r√ºhren kann. Sechsmal¬†...¬´

¬ªAh nein!¬´ Meine Mutter glaubte ihm nicht, ¬ªdas bringt ja gar kein Mann
zusammen¬†...¬´

¬ªH√∂ren S' Frau Mutzenbacher¬´, sagte Ekhard lachend, ¬ªhat Ihr Mann noch
nie sechs Nummern g'macht auf Ihnen?¬´

Meine Mutter kicherte: ¬ªJa, freilich was denn¬†...?¬´

In diesem Augenblick kam jemand. Das Gespr√§ch war zu Ende, und ich
f√ºhlte mich von jeder Angst befreit.

Auch die n√§chsten Tage war Herr Ekhard noch krank, wie er sagte. Er lag
freilich nicht mehr zu Bett, aber er ging in Unterhosen und Pantoffeln
im Haus herum, sa√ü bei der Mutter in der K√ºche, und oft merkte ich, da√ü
sie noch von der Sache sprachen.

Am dritten oder vierten Tag, ich war schon um zehn Uhr von der Schule
frei, kam ich am Vormittag nach Hause. Die K√ºche war leer; die Glast√ºr,
die in das Zimmer f√ºhrte und mit einer wei√üen Spitzengardine verh√§ngt
war, geschlossen. Ich sah gleich, da√ü die Mutter mit dem Herrn Ekhard im
Zimmer war. Und da sie mich nicht h√∂rten, verhielt ich mich still und
trachtete ihr Gespr√§ch zu erlauschen, weil ich dachte, es werde wieder
von mir die Rede sein.

Ich h√∂rte, wie meine Mutter sagte: ¬ªNix ham S' g'h√∂rt, eine Lug ist das
von Ihnen¬†...¬´ Ekhard entgegnete: ¬ªAber erinnern S' sich nur, es wird
schon stimmen¬†..., ich hab' ganz genau g'h√∂rt, wie Sie g'sagt haben, es
is Ihnen noch nicht gekommen, und wie Sie von Ihrem Mann verlangt haben,
er soll noch eine zweite Nummer machen.¬´

Die Mutter lachte: ¬ªJa, von dem eine zweite Nummer¬†..., da mu√ü man froh
sein, wenn er eine zusammenbringt¬†...¬´

¬ªNa sehen Sie¬´, meinte Ekhard eifrig, ¬ªer wird halt fr√ºher fertig wie
Sie, weil er zu viel Schw√§che hat¬†...¬´

Die Mutter antwortete m√ºrrisch: ¬ªAndere M√§nner werden auch nicht viel
besser sein.¬´

¬ªOho, da t√§uschen Sie sich aber recht sehr¬´, widersprach ihr Ekhard,
¬ªich kann's so lang zur√ºckhalten wie ich will, und wenn Sie es sich
dreimal wollen kommen lassen, liegt mir auch nix dran.¬´

Die Mutter lachte: ¬ªDas kann ein jeder sagen. Das glaub' ich nicht¬†...,
Sie tun sich nur prahlen¬†...¬´

¬ªWas prahlen¬†...? Was prahlen¬†...?¬´ Herr Ekhard trat ganz nah zu meiner
Mutter. ¬ªGeben Sie's her einmal¬†..., dann werden Sie schon sehen¬†...¬´

Die Mutter sch√ºttelte den Kopf: ¬ªAber nein, das wissen Sie schon, das
tu' ich nicht.¬´

Ekhard erwischte sie bei den H√ºften: ¬ªNa gehen S', jetzt w√§r' ich grad
aufgelegt, ein paar Nummern zu machen¬†...¬´

Er rang mit ihr, die sich str√§ubte: ¬ªLassen S' mich los, Herr Ekhard,
ich schrei'¬†...¬´

Ekhard lie√ü sie los, blieb aber dicht bei ihr und fl√ºsterte: ¬ªGehn S'
Frau Mutzenbacher, lassen S' mich dr√ºber, Sie g'fallen mir schon lang.¬´

Die Mutter trat von ihm fort und sch√ºttelte heftig den Kopf: ¬ªGeben Sie
mir an Ruh -- ich bin eine anst√§ndige Frau, verstehen Sie?¬´

Meine Mutter war eine schlanke, aber festgebaute Frau, und mochte damals
sechsunddrei√üig oder achtunddrei√üig Jahre alt sein. Sie hatte noch ein
frisches Gesicht und sch√∂ne blonde Haare.

¬ªH√∂ren Sie¬´, sagte Ekhard, ¬ªIhnen m√∂cht' man's aber nicht ankennen, da√ü
Sie schon drei Kinder g'habt haben¬†...¬´ Meine Mutter schwieg, und er
fuhr fort: ¬ªDas hei√üt n√§mlich, im Gesicht merkt man's nicht¬†...,
anderswo wird man's schon merken¬†...¬´

¬ªNirgends merkt man was¬´, rief die Mutter eifrig, ¬ªich bin noch ganz so,
wie ich als M√§dchen war.¬´

Jetzt spielte Ekhard den Ungl√§ubigen: ¬ªGehn S' weiter¬†..., bei die
G'spa√ülaberln wird man's schon kennen.¬´

Die Mutter war ganz beleidigt: ¬ªNix kennt man. Meine Brust ist noch grad
so wie sie war.¬´

Ekhard sprang zu ihr und wollte sie bei den Br√ºsten packen: ¬ªDas mu√ü ich
selber sehen¬´, rief er.

Aber die Mutter entzog sich ihm: ¬ªLassen Sie's bleiben, wenn Sie's nicht
glauben wollen.¬´

Dennoch gelang es Ekhard, eine Brust zu erwischen. Ich sah, wie er sie
fa√üte und zusammendr√ºckte. Und er war au√üer sich vor Freude: ¬ªNein, so
was! Nein, so was!¬´ rief er ein- ums anderemal. ¬ªDas ist ja wie bei
einer Jungfrau¬†..., h√∂ren Sie, das ist mir mein Leben noch nicht
vorgekommen.¬´

Die Mutter wehrte sich noch ein wenig, dann aber hielt sie still und
l√§chelte stolz: ¬ªNa sehen Sie¬´, sagte sie, ¬ªjetzt glauben Sie's mir.¬´

¬ªMeiner Seel, jetzt glaub ich's¬´, erwiderte Ekhard und nahm die zweite
Brust in die Hand, ohne da√ü meine Mutter es ihm verwehrte.

¬ªWissen Sie¬´, fuhr er fort und dabei spielte er mit beiden H√§nden an den
beiden Br√ºsten, so da√ü man durch die d√ºnne Perkailbluse die Warzen
hervortreten sah, ¬ªwissen Sie, Sie sind sch√∂n dumm, da√ü Sie mit so einer
sch√∂nen Brust noch sich anstrengen, damit's Ihnen einmal kommt, bei
Ihrem Mann. Da m√∂chten andere sich das Beuschel herausv√∂geln, nur wegen
dieser Duterln da¬†...¬´

¬ªIch bin halt eine brave Frau¬´, sagte die Mutter, aber sie stand ruhig
und lie√ü mit ihren Br√ºsten spielen.

¬ªBrav hin, brav her¬´, redete ihr Ekhard zu, ¬ªwenn der Mann nix hergibt,
h√∂rt sich die Bravheit auf. Da haben Sie keine Verpflichtung mehr. Die
Natur will befriedigt sein¬†...¬´

Mit diesen Worten hatte er die Bluse aufgekn√∂pft und nahm jetzt die
nackten Br√ºste aus dem Hemd. Sie lagen wei√ü in seinen braunen H√§nden.
¬ªGehn S', h√∂ren S' auf¬´, fl√ºsterte meine Mutter und suchte sich frei zu
machen. Aber er b√ºckte sich rasch und k√º√üte sie auf die linke
Brustwarze. Ich sah, wie meine Mutter am ganzen K√∂rper erbebte. ¬ªH√∂ren
S' auf¬†...! H√∂ren S' auf!¬´ fl√ºsterte sie eindringlich. Und dann setzte
sie hinzu: ¬ªEs k√∂nnt' wer kommen¬†...¬´ Sie stand vor den Doppelbetten,
die noch von der vergangenen Nacht nicht aufger√§umt waren. Ekhard warf
sie mit einem pl√∂tzlichen Sto√ü quer auf die Betten und lag gleich darauf
zwischen ihren Beinen.

Sie strampelte mit den Beinen, und Ekhard hatte viel M√ºhe, sie
niederzuhalten.

¬ªNein, nein¬†...¬´, fl√ºsterte sie, ¬ªich will nicht¬†..., ich will
nicht¬†..., ich bin eine brave Frau¬†...¬´

¬ªAch was¬´, herrschte sie Ekhard an, ¬ªSie wer'n schon einmal ein' andere
Nudel g'nommen haben.¬´

¬ªNein, noch nie ... noch nie ... Gehn Sie weg¬†..., oder ich schrei¬†...¬´

Ekhard suchte schon den Eingang mit seinem Schweif. ¬ªMachen S' keine
G'schichten, wegen ein' Mal¬†...¬´, keuchte er. Dabei sah ich von der
Seite, wie er die Br√ºste streichelte und dr√ºckte.

¬ªWenn jetzt wer kommt¬†...¬´, bat ihn die Mutter.

¬ªEs kommt niemand¬´, beruhigte er sie und begann schon mit seinen
heftigen V√∂gelst√∂√üen. Die Mutter lag ruhig da und regte sich kaum. Sie
sagte nur immer: ¬ªIch bitt' Sie, tun Sie's nicht¬†..., bitt' Sie¬†...,
nicht¬†...¬´ Auf einmal lachte sie: ¬ªSie finden ja gar nicht hin¬†...¬´
Ekhard stie√ü auf ihr herum. Und pl√∂tzlich h√∂rte ich sie fl√ºstern:
¬ªWarten Sie¬†..., nicht¬†..., nicht¬†...¬´, ein kurzes St√∂hnen kam, ein
langer Seufzer. Ekhard hatte ihr den Schweif hineingesto√üen.

Im Augenblick war alles ver√§ndert. Sie wurde von einem Beben am ganzen
K√∂rper gesch√ºttelt, dann breitete sie die F√º√üe weit auseinander und
Ekhard nahm sie, und legte sie sich auf beide Arme: ¬ªSo¬´, fl√ºsterte er,
¬ªso, Weiberl.¬´

Ich kannte seine taktm√§√üigen St√∂√üe und sah, da√ü er jetzt mit voller Lust
drauf losv√∂gelte, und ich √ºberlegte, ob ich dableiben und zuschauen oder
hinuntergehen und im Keller den Herrn Horak suchen sollte. Aber ich
f√ºrchtete, die beiden k√∂nnten mich h√∂ren, wenn ich mich r√ºhrte und dann
bannte mich doch die Neugierde an meinen Platz.

Meine Mutter begann die St√∂√üe Ekhards zu erwidern: ¬ªAh¬´, rief er, ¬ªdu
kannst es aber¬†..., du kannst es¬†..., ah¬†..., so eine warme enge
Fut¬†..., und so sch√∂ne Duterln¬†..., ah¬†..., und so gut zur√ºcksto√üen tust
du¬†..., ah¬†..., da lass ich mir's gar nicht kommen¬†..., da bleib' ich
immer drin¬†...¬´

Die Mutter atmete immer schwerer und immer schneller, dann brach auch
sie endlich mit ihren Reden los: ¬ªMaria und Josef¬†..., du tust mir
weh¬†..., so ein Schwanz so ein gro√üer¬†..., und so dick¬†..., ah¬†...,
s√º√ü¬†..., s√º√ü¬†..., ah¬†..., ah¬†..., das ist ganz anders als wie sonst¬†...,
fest nur fest¬†..., das g'sp√ºr ich bis in die Duteln herauf¬†..., v√∂gel
mich¬†..., v√∂gel mich gut ... Gleich kommt's mir.¬´

¬ªLa√ü dir nur Zeit¬´, meinte Ekhard, der sich wie ein Drescher auf und
nieder bewegte: ¬ªLa√ü dir nur Zeit¬†..., ich spritz' nicht¬†...¬´

¬ªAh, das ist gut¬†..., das kenn' ich noch gar nicht, wenn man so ruhig
sich ausv√∂geln darf¬´, fl√ºsterte sie. ¬ªMein Mann w√§r jetzt schon l√§ngst
fertig¬†..., ah¬†..., so ist's gut¬†..., so fest hinein¬†..., fest¬†..., und
remmel¬†..., ah ... das ist wunderbar¬†..., so lang hat's mein Mann noch
nie gemacht¬†...¬´

¬ªJetzt w√§r das Herausziehen unangenehm?¬´ fragte Ekhard. Dabei zog er
sich ein wenig zur√ºck.

Meine Mutter schrie laut auf, umklammerte ihn, und wie er wieder
hineinfuhr, schrie sie noch einmal: ¬ªAh¬†..., Gott¬†..., mir kommt's, ...
mir kommt's¬†..., um Gottes willen nur jetzt nicht fort¬†..., nur jetzt
nicht¬†..., bitte¬†..., bitte, bitte, bitte¬†...¬´

Ekhard flog nur so hin und her. ¬ªWas, jetzt darf ich auf einmal v√∂geln,
nicht wahr? Jetzt darf ich? Gelt ja? Und zuerst hast mich nicht dr√ºber
lassen wollen¬†...¬´

¬ªPuder mich nur ... Ach Gott, wenn ich das gewu√üt h√§tt', wie gut das
ist, wie gut der Schwanz ist und wie der remmeln kann¬†..., ach¬†...,
ach¬†..., jetzt¬†..., jetzt¬†..., jetzt¬†...¬´

Sie brach in ein Weinen, Quetschen und Schluchzen aus, und jappte nach
Atem. Ekhard v√∂gelte weiter.

Meine Mutter sagte: ¬ªMir ist's schon gekommen¬†...¬´

¬ªMacht nichts¬´, unterbrach er sie, ¬ªwird's dir halt noch einmal kommen.¬´
Und er stie√ü mit unverminderter Kraft drauf los.

¬ªNoch! Es kommt mir wirklich schon wieder¬†..., hah! Das hat's bei meinem
Mann nie gegeben¬†..., oh¬†..., ich sterbe¬†..., ich sterbe¬†..., ich sp√ºr'
den Schwanz bis zum Mund herauf, bitt' dich¬†..., nimm die Duteln¬†...,
spiel mit meiner Brust, bitte spiel mit den Duteln¬†..., so¬†..., so¬†...,
und v√∂gel mich nur immer weiter¬†...¬´

Ekhard gab sich noch mehr M√ºhe: ¬ªJetzt darf ich halt mit den Duterln
spielen, was?¬´ fragte er fl√ºsternd, ¬ªjetzt hei√üt's nicht mehr, `ich bin
eine brave Frau¬¥, was¬†..., mit der Nudel in der Fut h√∂ren sich die
Dummheiten auf¬†...¬´

Sie antwortete gl√ºcklich: ¬ªJa, la√ü sie nur in der Fut, deine Nudel¬†...,
la√ü sie nur¬†..., ah mir kommt's schon wieder, zum drittenmal, ... ach
was¬†..., brave Frau¬†..., ach was¬†..., mir kommt's¬†..., brave Frau¬†...,
v√∂gel mich, v√∂gel mich¬†..., und wenn auch wer kommt, mir liegt gar nix
dran¬†...¬´

Ekhard w√ºtete auf ihr. Er ri√ü an ihren Br√ºsten, hob ihre Beine hoch, und
indem h√∂rte ich das R√∂cheln, das ich kannte: ¬ªJetzt, ... jetzt spritz
ich¬†..., jetzt¬†...¬´

¬ªSpritz nur, spritz!¬´ Mit Entz√ºcken empfing die Mutter seinen Samen.
¬ªAch¬†..., jetzt¬†..., jetzt sp√ºr' ich's¬†..., jetzt¬†..., wie er
spritzt¬†..., ganz warm kommt's zu mir herein¬†..., ach und wie oft da√ü er
zuckt¬†..., ach das ist ein Schwanz, das ist ein Schwanz¬†..., hihi die
Duteln, nimm sie¬†..., so¬†..., mir kommt's auch¬†..., ich werd' gewi√ü ein
Kind kriegen¬†..., so viel spritzen tut's¬†..., macht nix¬†..., und wie er
noch st√∂√üt¬†..., wenn mein Mann spritzen tut, r√ºhrt er sich nimmer¬†...,
und du v√∂gelst noch so gut dabei¬†..., so ... so¬†..., und mein Mann
spritzt zweimal und dann ist's vorbei¬†..., ah¬†..., ah¬†..., ah¬†...¬´

Sie lagen alle beide ganz still aufeinander. Es war vor√ºber.

Dann erhob sich Ekhard und meine Mutter setzte sich auf. Ihr Haar hatte
sich aufgel√∂st, ihre Br√ºste standen frei und nackt hervor. Ihre R√∂cke
waren noch verschoben. Sie hielt sich die H√§nde vor das Gesicht, schaute
aber durch die gespreizten Finger zu Ekhard auf und l√§chelte.

Er griff nach ihren H√§nden, zog sie ihr vom Gesicht fort. ¬ªIch sch√§m'
mich¬´, sagte sie.

¬ªAch nix!¬´ tat er sie ab. ¬ªJetzt ist schon alles eins.¬´

¬ªMein Schwanz, mein guter!¬´ sagte sie, hielt seinen Schweif in ihrer
Hand und betrachtete ihn neugierig. ¬ªNein, so ein sch√∂ner Schweif¬†...,
mir ist noch immer als ob er drin stecken w√ºrde.¬´

Dann beugte sie sich herab und nahm die ganze, rote, dicke Nudel
Ekhards, die halb weich war, auf einmal in den Mund. Sofort stand die
Geschichte so fest wie fr√ºher.

¬ªKomm¬†..., v√∂geln.¬´ Ekhard zog den Schweif aus dem Mund der Mutter, und
wollte sie wieder aufs Bett werfen.

¬ªNein¬†...¬´, rief sie erstaunt, ¬ªnoch einmal? ... Du kannst es wirklich
noch einmal?¬´

¬ªDa ist doch nichts dabei¬†...¬´, sagte er. ¬ªNat√ºrlich ... noch
f√ºnfmal¬†..., wenn niemand kommt¬†...¬´

¬ªWenn nur niemand kommen m√∂cht'¬´, rief die Mutter, ¬ªich wei√ü nicht, ich
bin ganz verr√ºckt¬†..., ich halt's nicht aus¬†...¬´

¬ªAm besten¬´, meinte Ekhard, ¬ªam besten ist's f√ºr den Fall, da√ü jemand
k√§m', wir legen uns gar nicht nieder¬†..., setzen wir uns daher.¬´ Er
setzte sich auf einen Sessel, und aus seiner schwarzen Hose stand sein
roter Schweif hoch empor. Vorsichtig bestieg die Mutter diesen Sattel,
und ich sah, wie sie selbst mit ihrer Hand herunter griff, und sich den
Stift befestigte. Gleich darauf h√ºpfte sie wie rasend auf und nieder: ¬ªO
Gott, o Gott, so ist's noch besser, so ist's noch viel besser¬†..., o
Gott, o Gott¬†..., da tupft mich der Schwanz direkt am Herzen¬†...¬´

Ekhard brummte: ¬ªSiehst du, w√§rst nicht immer so stolz gewesen, h√§tten
wir schon lang v√∂geln k√∂nnen¬†...¬´

Die Mutter rief: ¬ªHalt mich bei den Duteln, da√ü ich dich √ºberall
hab'¬†..., halt mich¬†..., ach Gott¬†..., ach Gott¬†..., jetzt bin ich
f√ºnfzehn Jahr verheiratet¬†..., und nie hab' ich so gev√∂gelt¬†...,
nein¬†..., so ein Mann verdient's nicht¬†..., ach Gott, ach Gott¬†..., da√ü
man brav bleibt.¬´

Ihre Br√ºste flogen bei ihrem Tanz auf und nieder. Jetzt griff Ekhard
danach und hielt sie fest. Und bald auf die eine, bald auf die andere
Warze dr√ºckte er schmatzende, saugende K√ºsse.

¬ªMir kommt's¬†..., immerfort kommt's mir¬†..., alle Augenblick rinnt mir
die Natur heraus¬†..., ach du guter Mann¬†..., du kannst es, was¬†...? Mir
kommt's schon wieder¬†..., schon wieder¬†...¬´

Es w√§hrte nicht lange und Ekhard begann wieder sein R√∂cheln. Dann sah
ich, wie er mit seinen letzten St√∂√üen die Mutter hoch emporhob, die
Br√ºste, die er dabei festhielt, wurden ganz lang ausgezogen, aber das
sp√ºrte sie nicht. Sie hielt sich jetzt bewegungslos und lie√ü sich den
spritzenden Schaft in den Leib bohren. Aber ich konnte wahrnehmen, wie
ihr ganzer K√∂rper dabei zitterte, und sie hatte alle Worte verloren,
sondern wimmerte nur noch leise. Dann lag sie in seinen Armen eine Weile
wie tot. Endlich standen beide auf, und die Mutter kniete vor Ekhard
hin, nahm seinen Schweif in den Mund und fing an wie rasend daran zu
saugen und zu lecken.

Er sagte, w√§hrend es ihn beutelte: ¬ªNa, werden wir jetzt √∂fter beisammen
sein¬†...?¬´

Sie hielt inne und meinte: ¬ªIch bin Vormittag immer allein, das wei√üt du
ja¬†...¬´

Ekhard sch√ºttelte den Kopf: ¬ªIch mu√ü aber morgen schon wieder ins
G'sch√§ft¬†...¬´

Die Mutter fand gleich einen Ausweg: ¬ªDann komm ich halt in der Nacht zu
dir, wenn mein Mann im Wirtshaus ist¬†...¬´

¬ªUnd die Kinder¬†...?¬´

¬ªAh was¬´, gab sie zur√ºck, ¬ªdie Kinder schlafen¬†...¬´

Ekhard dachte wohl an mich und sagte skeptisch: ¬ªDas ist doch nicht so
gewi√ü, da√ü die Kinder schlafen¬†...¬´

¬ªAber ja¬´, beteuerte die Mutter, ¬ªdie h√∂ren nie was¬†..., v√∂gelt doch
mich mein Mann auch immer, wenn sie schlafen, und sie h√∂ren nie was¬†...¬´

Wieder mu√üte Ekhard wohl an mich denken. ¬ªSoo? Na, mir ist's recht¬´,
meinte er.

W√§hrenddessen hatte die Mutter immer seinen Schweif im Mund gehabt, und
ihn nur herausgezogen, wenn sie sprach. Jetzt sagte Ekhard: ¬ªMachen wir
g'schwind noch eine Nummer¬†..., bevor wer kommt¬†...¬´

Die Mutter sprang auf: ¬ªNein, so was¬†..., so was¬†..., aber
g'schwind¬†...¬´, nur einmal lass' ich mir's noch kommen¬†..., aber nur
sehr g'schwind¬†...¬´

Sie warf sich mit dem R√ºcken aufs Bett und hob ihre R√∂cke.

¬ªNein¬´, sagte er, ¬ªdreh dich um.¬´

Er richtete sie so, da√ü sie vor dem Bett stehend, mit dem Kopf auf dem
Leintuch sich st√ºtzte, und ihren Popo in die H√∂he streckte. Dann rannte
er ihr seinen Speer von hinten hinein. Sie lie√ü nur ein tiefes Gurgeln
h√∂ren, und gleich darauf seufzte sie: ¬ªMir kommt's¬†..., schon¬†...,
jetzt¬†..., bitt' dich spritz du auch¬†..., spritz¬†...¬´

Ekhard fl√ºsterte ihr zu: ¬ªJetzt spritz' ich, schad'¬†..., da√ü ich deine
Duteln¬†..., nicht angreifen kann¬†..., so¬†..., jetzt spritz' ich¬†...,
ah¬†..., ah¬†...¬´

Er zog seinen Schwanz gleich heraus, wischte ihn ab und kn√∂pfte die Hose
zu. Dann setzte er sich auf einen Sessel und trocknete sich den Schwei√ü
von der Stirne.

Die Mutter nahm das Lavoir vom Waschtisch, stellte es auf den Boden,
hockte sich dar√ºber und begann sich die Fut zu waschen. Wie sie damit
fertig war, ging sie zu Ekhard. Ihre Br√ºste hingen noch heraus. Sie
reichte ihm eine nach der anderen zum Mund hin: ¬ªNoch ein Bussel¬´,
verlangte sie und Ekhard nahm nacheinander ihre beiden Warzen in den
Mund und k√º√üte sie. Dann schlo√ü die Mutter ihre Bluse.

¬ªVielleicht komm' ich schon heut abend in die K√ºche hinaus¬†...¬´, sagte
sie.

Ekhard meinte: ¬ªNa sch√∂n, wird mich freuen.¬´

Die Mutter fing pl√∂tzlich von mir an, freilich, ohne zu wissen, da√ü sie
von mir rede: ¬ªNa, und was ist denn mit dem kleinen Luder, mit der du
sechs Nummern gemacht hast¬†...?¬´

Ekhard erwiderte: ¬ªWas soll denn mit ihr sein¬†...?¬´

¬ªWirst du sie vielleicht jetzt auch noch v√∂geln¬†...?¬´

¬ªDie¬†...?¬´ Ekhard l√§chelte. ¬ªBist du eifers√ºchtig¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬´, sagte die Mutter energisch, ¬ªich will, da√ü du nur mich
v√∂gelst¬†..., nur mich, ganz allein¬†...¬´

¬ªAber du la√üt dich doch auch von einem andern v√∂geln¬†...¬´

Sie war erstaunt: ¬ªIch¬†...? Von wem denn?¬´

¬ªNa, von deinem Mann doch¬†..., nicht?¬´

¬ªOh, von dem¬†..., den lass' ich jetzt gar nicht mehr dr√ºber¬†...¬´

¬ªDas gibt's doch nicht, der wird dich doch pudern wollen¬†...¬´

¬ªNa¬´, meinte sie z√∂gernd, ¬ªder tut's ja doch nur alle zwei, drei Wochen
einmal, und das kann dich ja nicht genieren ... Der steckt ihn ein
bisserl herein, fahrt zweimal hin und her und ist gleich wieder
fertig¬†...¬´

¬ªSo¬´, sagte Ekhard, ¬ªund ich werd' mein M√§derl alle zwei, drei Wochen
einmal pudern, ich steck' ihr ihn ja auch nicht ganz hinein, und so sind
wir quitt.¬´

¬ªIch bitt' dich¬´, warnte sie ihn, ¬ªgib nur Acht. Du kannst amal erwischt
werden und dann kommst ins Landesgericht¬†...¬´

Ekhard lachte: ¬ªNein, nein, mich erwischen s' nicht. Und du wirst
deswegen auch nicht zu kurz kommen, wenn ich das M√§del auch einmal
hernehm und petschier sie¬†...¬´

¬ªGeh jetzt hinaus¬´, sagte die Mutter, ¬ªes ist eben bald z' Mittag, und
es k√∂nnt leicht wer kommen¬†...¬´

Sie umarmten sich noch einmal. Ekhard mit beiden H√§nden an den Br√ºsten
der Mutter, sie mit der Hand an seinem Hosent√ºrl. Dann kam Ekhard
heraus.

Als er mich erblickte, erschrak er im ersten Moment.

Ich l√§chelte ihn verschmitzt an, und er war einige Sekunden lang so
verlegen, da√ü er nicht reden konnte. Dann kam er zu mir und fl√ºsterte:
¬ªHast du was gesehn?¬´ Ich l√§chelte weiter, statt jeder Antwort. Er fuhr
mir mit der Hand unter die R√∂cke und an meiner Fut spielend meinte er:
¬ªDu wirst niemandem was sagen¬†..., nicht wahr¬†...?¬´ Ich nickte nur, und
er lie√ü von mir ab, weil er f√ºrchtete, die Mutter k√∂nne herauskommen.

Seither habe ich ein paarmal belauscht, da√ü die Mutter abends, wenn der
Vater noch im Wirtshaus war, zu Ekhard in die K√ºche ging und ich h√∂rte
sie beide eine ganze Weile schnaufen. Auch Vormittag traf ich sie hie
und da beisammen. Ich selbst aber lie√ü mich von Herrn Ekhard nicht mehr
v√∂geln. Warum wu√üte ich eigentlich nicht, doch widerstrebte es mir. Er
packte mich einmal, als er Nachmittag offenbar zu diesem Zweck nach
Hause gekommen war und mich allein traf. Da ich mich str√§ubte, warf er
mich zu Boden und legte sich auf mich. Aber ich pre√üte die Knie zusammen
und stie√ü nach ihm, und da lie√ü er pl√∂tzlich von mir ab, warf mir einen
eigent√ºmlichen Blick zu, und hat mich seither nicht wieder anger√ºhrt.

In dem darauffolgenden Jahr lie√ü ich mich abwechselnd von Alois v√∂geln,
dann von Herrn Horak, den ich flei√üig in seinem Keller aufsuchte. Auch
Schani erschien einmal bei mir, und sagte mir im Hereinkommen schon, da√ü
seine Mutter und die √§lteste Schwester die Periode h√§tten, und da√ü er
deshalb heute nacht nur die Wetti gepudert habe. Und die folgende Nacht
brauchte er gar nicht zu v√∂geln. Wir benutzten das, um in der K√ºche
stehend in aller Eile eine Nummer zu machen, von der mir aber nichts in
Erinnerung geblieben ist, als die Tatsache, da√ü Schani konstatierte, ich
bek√§me schon einen Busen. Wirklich hatte ich schon ein paar kleine
Halb√§pfel angesetzt, die ganz h√ºbsch wegstanden. √úber den Kleidern waren
sie noch nicht so zu f√ºhlen, aber als ich dann ein paar Tage nachher
Herrn Horaks Hand unter mein Hemd f√ºhrte, war er davon so entz√ºckt, da√ü
ihm sein Schwanz sofort wieder stand, obwohl er mich eben zweimal
gefickt hatte, und fortw√§hrend mit meiner Brust spielend, vermochte er
es gleich ein drittesmal, was mir den Wert meines neuen Reizes erst
recht deutlich zeigte. Auch mein Bruder Franz v√∂gelte mich in diesem
Jahre ein paarmal. Er hatte nicht aufgeh√∂rt an Frau Reinthaler zu
denken, konnte ihrer jedoch nicht habhaft werden.

Zuf√§llig sah ich sie in dieser Zeit am Vormittag auf den Boden gehen.
Ich rief sofort Franz vom Hof herauf und teilte ihm die Gelegenheit mit.
Er kam, wagte es aber nicht, auf den Boden zu gehen. Ich redete ihm zu,
erz√§hlte ihm, da√ü sich Frau Reinthaler von Herrn Horak v√∂geln lasse, da√ü
sie gewi√ü bereit sein werde, ihn zu nehmen, ich malte ihm aus, was sie
f√ºr sch√∂ne Br√ºste habe, -- er traute sich nicht. Frech, wie ich war,
erbot ich mich ihn zu begleiten. Wir trafen Frau Reinthaler, wie sie
oben ihre W√§sche vom Strick abnahm.

¬ªK√º√ü die Hand, Frau Reinthaler¬´, sagte ich bescheiden.

¬ªGr√º√ü euch Gott, was macht's denn ihr da?¬´ fragte sie.

¬ªWir kommen zu Ihnen¬†...¬´

¬ªSo? Was wollt ihr denn von mir?¬´

¬ªVielleicht k√∂nnen wir Ihnen ein bissel was helfen¬´, meinte ich
heuchlerisch.

¬ªNa, na, ich dank' euch sch√∂n.¬´ Sie legte eben ein Leintuch zusammen.

Ich schlich mich an sie heran und griff ihr pl√∂tzlich an die Brust. Ich
spielte mit ihr, und lie√ü sie auf- und abschnellen. Franz stand da und
schaute auf diesen Busen und lie√ü kein Auge davon.

Frau Reinthaler pre√üte mich an sich und fragte: ¬ªWas machst denn da?¬´

¬ªDas ist so viel sch√∂n¬´, schmeichelte ich ihr.

Sie wurde feuerrot und schielte nach Franz, und l√§chelte. Und Franz
wurde ebenfalls rot, l√§chelte dumm, aber wagte es nicht, sich zu n√§hern.

Ich fuhr ihr unter die Bluse und holte die nackte Dutel heraus, und sie
lie√ü es geschehen und sah auf Franz, w√§hrend sie sagte: ¬ªWas machst du
denn?¬´

Da fl√ºsterte ich ihr zu: ¬ªDer Franzl m√∂cht' so gern¬†...¬´

Ich sp√ºrte, wie sich ihre Brustwarze momentan aufrichtete. Trotzdem
fragte sie: ¬ªWas m√∂cht' er denn¬†...?¬´

¬ªNa, Sie wissen schon¬†...¬´, fl√ºsterte ich ihr zu.

Sie l√§chelte und lie√ü sich von mir die Brust entbl√∂√üen, die voll und
wei√ü unter der roten Bluse hervorkam.

¬ªIch kann ja aufpassen¬´, sagte ich, und damit sprang ich von ihr fort.
Ich gab Franz einen Sto√ü, da√ü er geradewegs gegen die Brust der Frau
Reinthaler flog. Dann stellte ich mich auf den Vorboden, und wie ich
fr√ºher im Keller aufgepa√üt hatte, damit niemand die Frau Reinthaler
st√∂re, w√§hrend sie von Herrn Horak gestemmt wurde, pa√üte ich jetzt hier
auf dem Boden auf, damit die Frau Reinthaler nicht gest√∂rt werde, wenn
sie meinen Bruder bedient. Es war, wenn ich mich recht besinne, die
erste Kuppelei meines Lebens. Es sei denn, man will annehmen, da√ü ich
meine Mutter an den Ekhard verkuppelt habe, indem ich ihm von ihren
unbefriedigten N√§chten erz√§hlte.

Und nimmt man's genau, so mu√ü man wohl zugeben, dieser Ekhard ist wohl
erst durch diese Geschichte auf die Idee geraten, meiner Mutter mit
seinem Lausewenzel zwischen die Beine zu fahren, und er h√§tte sich
wahrscheinlich ansonsten begn√ºgt, die Tochter in ihren beiden noch
unvollkommenen L√∂chern auszubohren.

Franz stand also mit seinem Gesicht, wo ich ihn hingeschleudert hatte,
an der nackten Brust der Frau Reinthaler. Sie dr√ºckte ihn an sich und
fragte ihn: ¬ªWas willst du denn, Kleiner?¬´

Er antwortete nicht, aber er konnte auch nicht antworten, denn sie hatte
ihm ihre Brustspitze in den Mund gegeben wie einem S√§ugling, und Franz
leckte oben an dieser s√º√üen Beere, die immer gr√∂√üer wird statt kleiner,
je mehr man von ihr genie√üt.

Und von seinen Lippenbewegungen, von seiner Zunge begann es die Frau
aber am ganzen Leibe zu rei√üen. Es durchfuhr sie, und man konnte merken,
da√ü sie nun bald der Worte √ºberdr√ºssig sein werde.

Ich dachte nicht weiter daran aufzupassen, sondern beteiligte mich an
dem Spiele, das nun anfing. Frau Reinthaler legte sich auf ihren gro√üen
hochgef√ºllten W√§schekorb, hob die R√∂cke auf und lie√ü ihren schwarz
behaarten Schlund sehen, so da√ü ich meinte, mein Bruder werde nun per
Kopf darin verschwinden. Dann zog sie den Buben zu sich und versorgte
seinen Kleinen mit einem Ruck in ihrer Bauchtasche, die quatschend
zuschnappte.

Franz begann wie eine Taschenuhr zu ticken, so genau und so pr√§zis, und
Frau Reinthaler fing zu lachen an: ¬ªAch, das kitzelt ja¬†..., wie gut das
kitzelt¬†...¬´ Sie lachte und lachte, und lag ganz bewegungslos: ¬ªWie gut
er das kann¬†...¬´, meinte sie zu mir, ¬ªmacht er das oft¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬´, sagte ich.

¬ªUnd macht er's immer so g'schwind¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬´, erkl√§rte ich ihr, ¬ªder Franzl v√∂gelt immer so schnell¬†...¬´

Dann aber kniete ich nieder, nahm ihren Kopf und tat, wie mir Ekhard
getan, ich leckte und kitzelte sie mit der Zunge ins Ohr.

Sie gurrte mit heiserer Stimme vor Wollust.

¬ªV√∂gel nicht so schnell, Bubi¬´, bat sie Franz, ¬ªich will auch
sto√üen¬†..., wart¬†..., so¬†..., siehst du¬†..., so geht's noch besser.¬´

Sie regulierte den Takt von Franzls Bewegungen und schupfte ihn nun mit
ihrem repetierenden Hintern, da√ü der W√§schekorb krachte.

¬ªAch¬†..., es kommt mir¬†..., ach das ist gut¬†..., ach, das halt' ich
nicht aus¬†..., wenn die Pepi mich noch so im Ohr schleckt¬†..., da
kommt's mir gleich wieder¬†..., nein¬†..., Kinder¬†..., was seid ihr f√ºr
Kinder¬†..., ach¬†...¬´

¬ªDu Bubi¬´, sagte sie pl√∂tzlich mitten im Keuchen, ¬ªwarum nimmst du denn
das Duterl nicht in den Mund¬†...?¬´

Franz nahm ihre strotzende Brust und leckte an der Warze, als wollte er
daraus trinken.

Sie schrie auf: ¬ªAber¬†..., du h√∂rst ja zu v√∂geln auf¬†..., du h√∂rst ja
auf¬†..., und mir kommt's gerad¬†..., v√∂gel doch! So¬†..., fester,
schneller¬†..., ja¬†..., gut¬†..., so ist's gut ... Jesses, jetzt la√üt er
die Brust wieder aus¬†..., warum la√üt du denn die Brust aus¬†...?¬´

Franz hatte es noch immer nicht gelernt, beides zugleich zu tun. Deshalb
lie√ü ich das Ohr der Frau Reinthaler los, und kam ihm zu Hilfe, indem
ich die sch√∂ne volle Brust der Frau Reinthaler nahm. Auch die zweite
Dutel holte ich ihr heraus und √ºber ihrem Kopf liegend, k√º√üte ich sie
bald rechts, bald links, wobei ich sp√ºrte, wie der hei√üe Atem zwischen
meine Beine hinstrich, denn ich lag gerade mit der Fut √ºber ihrem
Gesicht. Sie hatte mir die R√∂cke zur√ºckgestreift und fuhr mir mit der
Hand an die Spalte, und sie traf mit ihrem Finger den rechten Punkt so
gut, da√ü es mir sehr wohltat und ich meinte, ich werde auch gev√∂gelt.

Ganz gleichzeitig kam es uns drei. Frau Reinthaler keuchte vor Wonne:
¬ªAch meine lieben Kinder¬†..., ach wie gut ist das¬†..., ach Franzl¬†...,
ich sp√ºr' wie du spritzen tust¬†..., und du Peperl¬†..., du bist auch ganz
na√ü geworden¬†..., ach¬†...!¬´

Dann lagen wir eine Weile ganz matsch √ºbereinander und mochten wohl auch
wie ein W√§sche- oder Kleiderb√ºndel ausgesehen haben.

Frau Reinthaler, die emporschnellte, warf Franz und mich zur Seite. Sie
richtete sich zusammen, war sehr rot und sch√§mte sich pl√∂tzlich.
¬ªNein¬†..., so was¬†..., diese Kinder¬†...¬´, murmelte sie. Dann lief sie
fort, vom Boden herunter.

Franz und ich blieben allein und machten es uns auf dem W√§schekorb
bequem. Ich nahm seinen Schwanz in den Mund, damit er wieder stehen
k√∂nne. Das tat er denn auch bald genug, und jetzt verlangte ich: ¬ªV√∂gel
mich¬†...¬´

¬ªNein¬´, sagte er, ¬ªdie Frau Reinthaler k√∂nnt' kommen¬†...¬´

¬ªDas macht nichts¬´, redete ich ihm zu, ¬ªdas macht doch nichts¬†..., sie
wei√ü ja, da√ü wir miteinand v√∂geln.¬´

¬ªIch will aber nicht¬´, weigerte er sich weiter.

¬ªWarum nicht¬†...?¬´

¬ªWeil¬†..., weil ... du keine Duteln hast¬´, erkl√§rte er.

¬ªWas?¬´ Ich ri√ü mein Leibchen auf und zeigte ihm meine beiden kleinen
√Ñpfel.

Er begann damit zu spielen und ich legte mich auf den Korb der Frau
Reinthaler. Franz legte sich auf mich und ich f√§delte ihn so schnell
ein, da√ü er bis an den Schaft drin sa√ü. Er puderte ausgezeichnet, und
mir schmeckte es. Wir waren bald fertig, standen auf, lie√üen die W√§sche
liegen, wie sie lag, und gingen vom Boden fort.

Franz lauerte von nun ab der Frau Reinthaler noch hitziger auf als
fr√ºher. Aber wenn er sie jetzt traf, nahm sie ihn, sooft es ging, in
ihre Wohnung und unterrichtete ihn, wie man es machen m√ºsse, die Fut und
die Brust gleichzeitig mit Schmeicheleien zu versehen. Und Franz machte
bald die erfreulichsten Fortschritte. Oft holte sie ihn aus unserer
Wohnung und hatte jedesmal eine Ausrede. ¬ªFranzl, m√∂chst nicht f√ºr mich
zum Greisler gehn, um Petroleum?¬´ Oder: ¬ªFranzl, m√∂chst mir nicht
g'schwind ein Bier bringen?¬´ Und wenn sie so kam, dann wu√üte ich schon
jedesmal, was bevorstehe, wenn Franzl mit dem Gebrachten in ihrer
Wohnung verschwand.

So standen die Dinge, als meine Mutter pl√∂tzlich starb. Ich war dreizehn
Jahre alt, und mitten in der Entwicklung begriffen. Da√ü mir die Br√ºste
so rasch wuchsen, da√ü mein kleiner Polster zwischen meinen F√º√üen mit
Locken sich bedeckte, schreibe ich heute doch wohl dem vielen
Geschlechtsverkehr zu, den ich so fr√ºhzeitig gepflogen, den heftigen
Reizungen, denen mein K√∂rper ausgesetzt war. Ich hatte die ganze Zeit,
bis zum Tode meiner Mutter, fortw√§hrend gev√∂gelt, und wenn ich es
√ºberschlage, vielleicht mit zwei Dutzend M√§nnern Unzucht getrieben.

Von den hier erz√§hlten war mein Bruder Franz, dann Ferdl, dann Robert,
dann Herr Horak, der mich im Verlauf der Begebenheit vielleicht
f√ºnfzigmal in seinem Bierkeller wie ein Bierfa√ü mit seiner Pipe
eingespundet hat, dann Alois, bei dem ich etlichemale im Scho√ü seiner
Klementine ¬ªSchlu√ü mit Genu√ü¬´ sagen h√∂rte, dann der Herr Ekhard, dann
der Schani, den ich aber nur ein einzigesmal zu kosten bekam, ein
einzigesmal den Soldaten, einmal den Burschen, der mich gleich nachher
zwang, ihm zu Willen zu sein. Dazu kommen die vielen Buben, die ich in
den Keller lockte oder die mich in irgendeinem Hausflur, hinter der
Planke oder sonst wo an die Wand lehnten und mir die Spalte ausrieben,
und ein paar M√§nner, die mich w√§hrend meiner Streifwege auf dem
F√ºrstenfeld zusammenfingen, mich auf meine Augen hin gleich anpackten
und es versuchten, mich anzubohren, wobei sie mir aber meistens nur den
Bauch bespritzten. Einige von ihnen habe ich vergessen. In Erinnerung
ist mir nur ein besoffener Schlosser geblieben, der mich auf freiem
Feld, w√§hrend es noch Tag war, v√∂gelte, mich dabei w√ºrgen wollte, dem es
aber sofort kam, als sein Schwanz nur meine Haut ber√ºhrte. Dann noch ein
alter Mann, ein Hausierer, der mir ein paar blaue Strumpfb√§nder schenkte
und mich in einem der kleinen Wirtsh√§user, die es damals da drau√üen gab,
auf den Abort lockte. Er setzte sich dort nieder, als wolle er seine
Notdurft verrichten, nahm mich zwischen seine Knie und rieb mir nur von
r√ºckw√§rts die halbsteife Nudel zwischen die Schenkel. Es werden wohl
zwei Dutzend M√§nner gewesen sein.

Da starb auf einmal meine Mutter. Sie war nur zwei Tage krank gewesen.
Was ihr gefehlt hat, wei√ü ich nicht. Ich erinnere mich nur, da√ü sie am
andern Tag, des Morgens gleich abgeholt und in die Totenkammer gebracht
wurde.

Wir Kinder weinten sehr, denn wir hatten sie sehr lieb gehabt. Sie war
immer gut zu uns gewesen, hatte uns nur selten geschlagen; w√§hrend wir
uns vor dem Vater, der immer streng war, doch weit eher f√ºrchteten, als
wir ihn gern hatten. Mein Bruder Lorenz sagte damals zu mir: ¬ªDas ist
die Strafe Gottes f√ºr eure S√ºnden, f√ºr den Franzl seine und f√ºr
deine¬†...¬´ Ich war tief ersch√ºttert von diesen Worten und glaubte ihm.

Deshalb enthielt ich mich auch nach dem Tod meiner Mutter jeglicher
Unzucht. Ich gelobte mir, mich nie wieder v√∂geln zu lassen, und der
Anblick des Herrn Ekhard war mir unertr√§glich. Er war √ºbrigens sehr
niedergeschlagen und zog acht Tage, nachdem die Mutter gestorben war,
von uns fort. Ich atmete auf, als er aus dem Hause war. Franzl, mit dem
ich jetzt nat√ºrlich noch viel √∂fter als sonst allein blieb, griff mir
einmal an die Br√ºste. Aber ich gab ihm eine Ohrfeige, und so lie√ü er
mich in Ruhe.

Dieser Todesfall bildete einen Abschnitt in meinem jungen Leben. Ich
h√§tte mich vielleicht noch gebessert, aber es kam anders.




ZWEITES KAPITEL


Ich war jetzt braver als je vorher in der Schule, und flei√üiger. Meine
Mutter war schon zwei Monate tot, und ich hatte ein keusches Leben
gef√ºhrt. Weder einen Schwanz noch eine Schwanzspitze hatte ich die ganze
Zeit gesehen, und wenn mich meine Muschel kitzelte und ich wider Willen
ans V√∂geln denken mu√üte, hatte ich doch der Versuchung widerstanden, das
Verlangen, das mir zwischen den F√º√üen brannte, mit eigenen Fingern zu
tr√∂sten. Da wurde f√ºr unsere Klasse und f√ºr die ganze √ºbrige
beichtpflichtige Schule wieder eine Beichte angesetzt. Ich wollte mich
diesmal von der S√ºnde der Unkeuschheit reinigen und beschlo√ü, alles zu
beichten. Auch f√ºr die Tods√ºnde, die ich begangen hatte, indem ich meine
Vergehungen bei allen fr√ºheren Beichten verschwiegen, wollte ich diesmal
Vergebung erbitten.

Bisher hatte ich, sooft ich bei unserem jungen Katecheten zur Beichte
war, immer nein gesagt, wenn er mich am Schlu√ü meines Bekenntnisses
fragte: ¬ªHast du Unkeuschheit getrieben?¬´

Es war ein schwarzhaariger, langer und bleicher junger Mann und besa√ü
eine strenge Miene, vor der ich mich ebenso sehr f√ºrchtete, wie vor
seiner m√§chtigen Nase. Diesmal aber wollte ich aufrichtig alles
gestehen.

Die Kirche war voll Kinder, und es wurde an drei Beichtst√ºhlen
gebeichtet. Ich kam zu einem √§ltlichen fetten Kooperator, mit einem
gro√üen runden Gesicht. Ich kannte ihn nur vom Sehen, und er schien mir
nachsichtig zu sein, weil er immer so freundliche Mienen machte.

Zuerst beichtete ich meine kleinen S√ºnden. Doch er unterbrach mich mit
der Frage: ¬ªHast vielleicht gar Unkeuschheit getrieben?¬´

Zitternd sprach ich: ¬ªJa¬†...¬´

Er legte seine harten Wangen dicht an das Gitter und fragte: ¬ªMit
wem¬†...?¬´

¬ªMit dem Franzl¬†...¬´

¬ªWer ist das?¬´

¬ªMein Bruder¬†...¬´

¬ªDein Bruder¬†...? So! So! Und vielleicht noch mit wem?¬´

¬ªJa¬†...¬´

¬ªAlso¬†...?¬´

¬ªMit dem Herrn Horak¬†...¬´

¬ªWer ist das?¬´

¬ªDer Bierversilberer in unserm Haus.¬´

¬ªMit wem noch¬†...?¬´ Seine Stimme bebte.

Ich mu√üte das ganze Namensregister herz√§hlen.

Er r√ºhrte sich nicht, als ich fertig war. Nach einer Pause fragte er:
¬ªWie hast du Unkeuschheit getrieben¬†...?¬´

Ich wu√üte nicht, was ich antworten sollte. Da herrschte er mich an:
¬ªAlso wie habt ihr's denn gemacht?¬´

¬ªMit¬†..., na¬†...¬´, ich stotterte, ¬ªmit dem, was ich zwischen den
F√º√üen¬†...¬´

Er sch√ºttelte den Kopf: ¬ªHabt ihr gev√∂gelt¬†...?¬´

Mir kam das Wort aus seinem Munde merkw√ºrdig vor, aber ich sagte:
¬ªJa¬†...¬´

¬ªUnd hast du's auch in den Mund genommen¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa.¬´

¬ªUnd hast du dir's auch in den Arsch stecken lassen?¬´

¬ªJa.¬´

Er schnaufte und seufzte und sagte: ¬ªAch Gott, ach Gott, mein Kind¬†...,
Tods√ºnden¬†..., Tods√ºnden¬†...¬´

Ich war ganz weg vor Angst. Er aber meinte: ¬ªDa mu√ü ich alles wissen,
h√∂rst du? Alles!¬´ Nach einer Weile fuhr er fort. ¬ªDas wird aber eine
lange Beichte werden¬†..., und die andern Kinder warten¬†..., bleibt nix
√ºbrig, als da√ü du extra beichten kommst, verstehst?¬´

¬ªJa, Hochw√ºrden¬†...¬´, stammelte ich.

¬ªGleich Nachmittag, so um zwei¬†..., kommst zu mir¬†...¬´

Ich verlie√ü verzweifelt den Beichtstuhl. ¬ªBis dahin¬´, sagte mir der
Kooperator Mayer noch zum Schlu√ü, ¬ªbis dahin erinner dich an alles. Denn
wenn du nicht alles beichten wirst, hilft dir die Absolution nicht¬†...¬´

Ich schlich beklommenen Herzens nach Hause, setzte mich nieder und
dachte krampfhaft nach und lie√ü mir alles, was ich getan hatte, wieder
einfallen. Vor der Beichte im Zimmer des Kooperators hatte ich eine
gro√üe Angst und f√ºrchtete mich vor der Bu√üe, die er mir auferlegen
werde. Als es aber Zeit war und ich gehen mu√üte, fragte mich mein Bruder
Lorenz, wohin ich in dem sch√∂nen Kleid wolle, und da sagte ich stolz:
¬ªZum Herrn Kooperator Mayer mu√ü ich¬†..., er hat mir's geschafft, da√ü ich
hinkommen soll.¬´ Lorenz sah mich mit einem sonderbaren Blick an, und ich
ging.

Es war Sommer, aber im gro√üen Pfarrhaus umfing mich eine heilige K√ºhle
und eine Stille, die mir Ehrfurcht einfl√∂√üte. Ich las an den T√ºren die
Namensschilder und klopfte an die T√ºre, auf der ¬ªKooperator Mayer¬´
stand. Er √∂ffnete mir selbst. Er war in Hemd√§rmeln, und seine schwarze
Weste war aufgekn√∂pft, so da√ü sein ungeheurer Bauch hervorquoll.

Jetzt, da ich ihn au√üerhalb des Beichtstuhles zum erstenmale wiedersah,
und sein dickes, rotes Pfaffengesicht mir Respekt erregte und mir
au√üerdem einfiel, da√ü er von mir das viele wu√üte, trieb mir die
Besch√§mung und die Angst das Blut ins Gesicht.

¬ªGelobt sei Jesus Christus¬†...¬´

¬ªIn Ewigkeit¬†...¬´, antwortete er. ¬ªDa bist du ja¬†...¬´

Ich k√º√üte seine fleischige, warme Hand, und er versperrte die T√ºr. Wir
traten durch ein kleines dunkles Vorgela√ü in sein Zimmer. Es ging auf
den Friedhof. Die Fenster standen offen und die gr√ºnen Baumwipfel
versperrten jede Aussicht. Das Zimmer war breit und ganz wei√ü
gestrichen. Ein gro√ües Kruzifix hing schwarz an der einen Wand, davor
stand ein Betschemel. An der anderen Wand stand ein Eisenbett, eine
gesteppte Decke war dar√ºber gebreitet. Ein breiter Schreibtisch nahm die
Mitte ein, mit einem riesigen, schwarzledernen Armsessel.

Der Kooperator zog seine Soutane an und kn√∂pfte sich zu.

¬ªKomm¬´, sagte er.

Wir traten an das Betpult, knieten nebeneinander nieder und sprachen ein
Vaterunser.

Dann f√ºhrte er mich an der Hand zum Gro√üvaterstuhl, setzte sich hinein,
und ich stand vor ihm gegen die Schreibtischkante fest angelehnt.

¬ªNa¬´, sagte er, ¬ªalso ich h√∂re¬†...¬´ Ich schwieg aber und wu√üte nicht wie
anfangen vor Verwirrung.

¬ªAlso erz√§hl¬†...¬´

Ich schwieg noch immer und schaute zu Boden.

¬ªH√∂r du!¬´ begann er, fa√üte mich unterm Kinn und zwang mich, ihm in die
Augen zu schauen. ¬ªDu wei√üt, da√ü du schon ges√ºndigt hast¬†...,
Unkeuschheit¬†..., eine Tods√ºnde¬†..., verstehst du¬†..., und mit deinem
eigenen Bruder¬†..., Blutschande¬†...¬´

Ich h√∂rte das Wort zum erstenmal, und ohne es zu verstehen, erbebte ich.

Er fuhr fort: ¬ª...¬†Wer wei√ü¬†..., vielleicht bist du ganz verdammt und
hast dein Seelenheil schon verwirkt f√ºr immer¬†..., wenn ich deine Seele
noch retten soll, mu√ü ich alles wissen, ganz genau¬†..., und du mu√üt es
mit Bu√üfertigkeit erz√§hlen.¬´

Er sprach mit leiser, stockender Stimme, und das machte einen solchen
Eindruck auf mich, da√ü ich zu weinen anfing.

¬ªWein nicht¬´, herrschte er mich an.

Ich schluchzte.

Er wurde milder: ¬ªNa, wein nicht, Kinderl. Vielleicht wird alles
gut¬†..., erz√§hl nur.¬´

Ich wischte mir die Tr√§nen ab, vermochte aber nichts zu sagen.

¬ªJa, ja¬´, hub er an, ¬ªdie Versuchung ist gro√ü¬†..., und du hast
vielleicht gar nicht gewu√üt, da√ü das so eine S√ºnde ist, was¬†...?
Gewi√ü¬†..., du bist ja noch ein Kind¬†..., du hast nichts gewu√üt¬†...,
nicht wahr?¬´

Ich fa√üte Mut: ¬ªNein, nichts hab' ich gewu√üt¬†...¬´

¬ªNa¬´, sprach er, ¬ªdas ist schon besser¬†..., bist du nicht dem eigenen
Drang gefolgt¬†..., sondern verf√ºhrt worden¬†..., zum Beispiel¬†...?¬´

Ich erinnerte mich sofort an das erste ¬ªVater- und Mutterspiel¬´ und
beteuerte lebhaft: ¬ªJa, Hochw√ºrden¬†..., verleitet bin ich worden¬†...¬´

¬ªHab' mir's gleich gedacht¬†...¬´, nickte er mild, ¬ªwenn man das da so
sichtbar tr√§gt¬†..., das lockt die Versucher an.¬´

Er legte seine Hand leicht auf meine Brust, die schon spitz und hoch
unter meiner Bluse hervorstach. Ich sp√ºrte die W√§rme, die von ihm
ausging, und es beruhigte mich, aber mir fiel nichts Arges dabei ein.

¬ªDas ist ein Werk des Satans¬´, fuhr er fort, ¬ªda√ü er einem Kind schon
die Br√ºste eines Weibes gibt¬†...¬´, dabei nahm er meine andere Brust in
die zweite Hand und hielt nun beide.

¬ªAber die Duteln m√ºssen die Weiber verstecken¬´, sprach er weiter, ¬ªsie
m√ºssen sie unsichtbar machen und schn√ºren, um die M√§nner nicht zu
reizen. Diese Duteln sind Werkzeuge der Wollust ... Gott hat sie dem
Weibe verliehen, damit sie ihre Kinder s√§ugen, aber der Teufel hat ein
Spielzeug f√ºr die Unkeuschen daraus gemacht, und man mu√ü sie
verstecken.¬´

Ich fand nichts dabei, da√ü er das tat, sondern h√∂rte ihm voll Spannung
und Erbauung zu.

¬ªAlso, wie ist das gewesen¬´, fragte er wieder.

Aber wieder war es mir nicht m√∂glich davon zu reden.

¬ªGut¬†...¬´, meinte er milde, nachdem er eine Weile gewartet hatte, da√ü
ich spreche: ¬ªGut¬†..., ich sehe¬†..., dein Herz ist rein¬†..., und du
tr√§gst Scham, von diesen Dingen zu sprechen.¬´

¬ªJa¬†..., Hochw√ºrden¬†...¬´, stammelte ich begeistert.

¬ªAlso¬†...¬´, fl√ºsterte er, ¬ªich werde dich fragen, und du wirst
antworten oder besser, wenn du nicht sprechen kannst, wirst du mir durch
Geb√§rden zeigen, was du verbrochen hast! Ja?¬´

¬ªIch will's, Hochw√ºrden¬´, versprach ich dankbar, nahm seine Hand von
meiner Brust und k√º√üte sie inbr√ºnstig.

¬ªIch mu√ü¬´, erl√§uterte er weiter, ¬ªalle Grade und Arten der Unkeuschheit
kennen, die du begangen hast. Also beginne. Hast du den Schweif in den
Mund genommen¬†...?¬´

Ich nickte.

¬ªOft¬†...?¬´

Ich nickte wieder.

¬ªUnd was hast du mit ihm gemacht ... der Reihe nach¬†...?¬´

Ich schaute ihn ratlos an.

¬ªHast du mit der Hand gespielt damit?¬´

Ich nickte wieder.

¬ªWie hast du gespielt¬†...?¬´

Ich stand da, ohne zu wissen, was ich sagen oder tun sollte.

¬ªZeig mir genau¬´, fl√ºsterte er, ¬ªwie du's gemacht hast¬†...¬´

Meine Ratlosigkeit stieg auf ihren Gipfel.

Er l√§chelte salbungsvoll: ¬ªNimm nur meinen Schweif¬†...¬´, sagte er, ¬ªan
dem geweihten Priester ist alles rein¬†..., nichts an ihm ist S√ºnde¬†...,
und nichts an ihm ist s√ºndig.¬´

Ich war sehr erschrocken und r√ºhrte mich nicht.

Er fa√üte mich bei der Hand und fl√ºsterte weiter: ¬ªNimm nur mein Glied
und zeige mir alle deine S√ºnden. Ich leihe dir meinen Leib, damit du vor
meinem Angesicht beichtest und dich reinigest.¬´ Und damit f√ºhrte er
mich an sein Hosent√ºrl.

Ich mu√üte tief unter seinen Bauch greifen und zitterte vor Ehrerbietung
dabei. Er kn√∂pfte sich auf, und ein dicker kurzer Schwanz stand aufrecht
und steif unter der schwarzen Mauer seiner Hose.

¬ªWie hast du mit ihm gespielt?¬´ fragte er.

Ich war furchtbar verlegen. Aber ich fa√üte, wenn auch zaghaft, die
Nudel, zu der er mich f√ºhrte, umschlo√ü sie mit der Hand und fuhr zwei-,
dreimal sch√ºchtern auf und nieder.

Er machte ein ernstes Gesicht und forschte weiter: ¬ªDas war alles?
Verheimliche mir jetzt nichts¬†..., ich sag' es dir¬†...¬´

Ich fuhr noch ein paarmal hin und her.

¬ªWas hast du noch damit getan?¬´

Ich erinnerte mich an den Griff Klementinens, fa√üte ihn mit Daumen und
Mittelfinger unter der Eichel und tupfte mit dem Zeigefinger die Vorhaut
herab.

Er lehnte sich im Gro√üvaterstuhl zur√ºck. ¬ªWas hast du noch an verruchten
K√ºnsten ge√ºbt?¬´

Ich scheute mich, mehr zu tun, lie√ü ihn beim Schwanz los und lispelte:
¬ª...¬†In den Mund¬†..., hab' ich's genommen¬†...¬´

¬ªWie¬†...?¬´ Er atmete heftig, ¬ª...¬†wie hast du das getan¬†...?¬´

Zweifelnd blickte ich ihn an. Aber er schaute voll Ernst und W√ºrde auf
mich und meinte: ¬ªBist du bereit? Oder willst du mir undankbar sein, f√ºr
die Gnade, die ich dir erweise. Wisse denn, du bist von aller S√ºnde
schon halb gereinigt, wenn du mich so ber√ºhrst wie deine Buhlen¬†...¬´

Das leuchtete mir au√üerordentlich ein, und ich pries mich gl√ºcklich, da√ü
ich so von S√ºnden kommen d√ºrfe.

Wie er also nochmals fragte: ¬ªWas hast du noch damit getan¬´, kniete ich
unges√§umt nieder und nahm vorsichtig seinen Schwanz in den Mund.

¬ªNur das Spitzel¬†...¬´, fragte er.

Augenblicklich stie√ü ich mir den Storchenschaft tiefer in den Rachen.

¬ªUnd sonst nichts¬†...?¬´ t√∂nte die Stimme von oben.

Ich fuhr mit den Lippen auf und ab, suzelte und sog an diesem Speer und
kitzelte mit der Zunge daran herum, und eine heftige Erregung erfa√üte
mich. Aber ich wu√üte damals nicht, ob es mehr Angst, Bu√üfertigkeit oder
Geilheit war.

Ich h√∂rte, wie der Kooperator st√∂hnte: ¬ªAch¬†..., ach¬†..., so was¬†..., so
eine S√ºnderin¬†..., ach¬†..., ach¬†...¬´, und ich bedauerte ihn so sehr, da√ü
ich nachlie√ü, ihm diese Qual nicht l√§nger zu bereiten, sondern aufh√∂rte.
Ich lie√ü seinen Schwanz aus meinem Mund gleiten, trocknete ihn, der in
meiner Hand zuckte, mit dem Taschentuch sorgsam ab und stand auf.

Der Kooperator war blaurot im Gesicht und haschte mit der Hand nach mir.

¬ªUnd was noch¬†..., was hast du mit den Schw√§nzen, so du gehabt hast¬†...,
noch getan¬†...¬´

¬ªUnkeuschheit getrieben, Hochw√ºrden¬´, fl√ºsterte ich.

¬ªDas wei√ü ich¬†...¬´, fl√ºsterte er, nach Atem ringend, ¬ªdu hast mir jetzt
drei Arten davon gezeigt¬†..., hast dich von drei Arten gereinigt, ... du
hast aber noch mehr mit einem Schwanz getan¬†..., willst du jetzt
leugnen¬†...¬´

¬ªNein, Hochw√ºrden¬†...¬´

¬ªAlso, was war's, was du getan hast¬†...?¬´

¬ªGev√∂gelt habe ich, Hochw√ºrden¬†...¬´

¬ªWie gev√∂gelt¬†...¬´

¬ªNa¬†..., gev√∂gelt¬´, wiederholte ich.

¬ªDamit wei√ü ich gar nichts¬´, brauste er auf, ¬ªdu mu√üt mir zeigen, wie
du's gemacht hast¬†...¬´

Ich war wieder ratlos. Meine R√∂cke aufzuheben und mich selbst mit seinem
Schweif zu v√∂geln, traute ich mich doch nicht.

¬ªSoll ich dir's vielleicht zeigen, wie du's gemacht hast¬†...¬´, fragte
er. ¬ªSoll ich dich selber fragen?¬´

¬ªJa¬†...¬´

Ich war jetzt selbst begierig, da√ü alles geschehen m√∂ge und war froh
zugleich, denn mit ihm schien es ja keine S√ºnde, sondern ein Mittel, die
S√ºnde abzub√º√üen. Und da ich so lange schon keinen Schwanz im Mund oder
sonstwo gehabt hatte, war mir bei diesem Schlecken doch der Wunsch
erwacht, diesen Pfeil auch in das Zentrum gesto√üen zu kriegen.

Der Kooperator stand auf und f√ºhrte mich zum Bett.

¬ªWie hast du's gemacht¬†...?¬´

Ich sagte: ¬ªHochw√ºrden wissen schon¬†...¬´

¬ªNichts wei√ü ich¬´, fiel er ein, ¬ª...¬†du mu√üt mir alles sagen. Hast du
dich niedergelegt, oder bist du oben gelegen¬†...?¬´

¬ªEinmal so und dann wieder so¬†..., Hochw√ºrden¬†...¬´

¬ªAlso wie bist du unten gelegen¬†...?¬´

Ich legte mich, wie ich stand, quer mit dem R√ºcken √ºber das Bett. Meine
Beine hingen √ºber den Rand herab.

¬ªSo bist du gelegen¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa.¬´

¬ªDa wirst du aber wohl schwerlich was angestellt haben¬†...¬´, meinte er,
¬ªda kann dir ja der b√∂se Versucher nicht an den Leib¬†..., was hast du
dann noch gemacht¬†..., oder hat er dir die R√∂cke aufgehoben¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa.¬´

¬ªSo vielleicht¬†...?¬´ Er streifte mit einem Ruck meine Kleider in die
H√∂he, so da√ü meine nackten Schenkel und die blondbraune, frischbehaarte
Grotte freilagen.

¬ªWar es so¬†...¬´, fragte er.

¬ªJa¬†..., Hochw√ºrden¬´, gab ich liegend zur Antwort.

Er schob meine Knie auseinander: ¬ªUnd so¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa.¬´

Er trat zwischen meine Beine und sein dicker Bauch lag auf dem meinigen,
obwohl der Herr Kooperator stand.

¬ªUnd ist der Schweif so zu dir hineingekommen, um dir fleischliche L√ºste
zu bereiten¬†...?¬´

Stehend schob er mir seine geweihte Kerze, die ganz warm war, an die
√ñffnung. Ich mu√üte, als ich das versp√ºrte, ihm entgegensto√üen. Langsam,
sehr langsam drang er ein. Der Kooperator, dessen Gesicht ich nicht sah,
keuchte laut. Ich hielt mit meiner Muschel seinen Stiel umklammert, der
ziemlich weit eingedrungen war. Jetzt wollte ich auch gev√∂gelt sein. Da
es keine S√ºnde war, erst recht. Ich lag da mit einem Gef√ºhl, in das sich
Staunen, Wollust, Freude und Lachlust mengten und in dem meine
Befangenheit sich endlich l√∂ste. Ich fing an zu begreifen, da√ü der Herr
Kooperator eine Kom√∂die spielte, und es einfach darauf abgesehen hatte,
mich zu pudern. Aber ich war entschlossen, diese Kom√∂die mitzumachen,
mir nichts merken zu lassen, und im √ºbrigen glaubte ich doch daran, da√ü
der Herr Kooperator die Macht habe, mich von meinen S√ºnden zu
absolvieren. Wie er nun so mit seinem Pfahl in meinem Fleische steckte,
und nicht hin- noch herfahren wollte, sondern nur schnaufte, begann ich
mit dem Popo auf- und niederzuh√ºpfen, wodurch sein Keuchen sich nur
vermehrte.

¬ªHochw√ºrden¬†...¬´, fl√ºsterte ich.

¬ªWas denn¬†...?¬´ fragte er schnaubend.

¬ªSo ist's nicht gewesen¬´, sagte ich leise.

¬ªWie denn¬†...?¬´

¬ªHin und her, aus und ein ist er mir gefahren.¬´

Er begann vorsichtig, aber kr√§ftig und rasch zu sto√üen. ¬ªSo vielleicht?¬´

¬ªAch¬†...¬´, rief ich, von Wollustschauder durchzuckt, ¬ªach¬†..., ja¬†...,
so¬†..., nur¬†..., schneller¬†..., Hochw√ºrden¬†..., schneller¬†...¬´

¬ªBrav, mein Kind¬†..., brav¬†...¬´, keuchte er, ¬ªso¬†..., sag mir alles, wie
es war¬†..., sprich nur¬†...¬´ Er konnte nicht weiter reden, so st√ºrmisch
flog sein Atem und so heftig remmelte er.

Ich lie√ü mich nicht weiter aufmuntern: ¬ªAch¬†..., ach¬†..., so war's¬†...,
so ist's gut¬†..., so ist's gut¬†..., besser¬†..., Hochw√ºrden¬†..., spritzen
Sie¬†..., spritzen Sie¬†..., mir kommt's¬†..., mir kommt's¬†..., ich kann
nichts daf√ºr¬†..., aber¬†..., Hochw√ºrden¬†..., der Schwanz ist so gut¬†...,
so viel gut ist das, was Hochw√ºrden tun¬†...¬´

Er st√ºtzte seine H√§nde auf und war √ºber mich gebeugt, so weit es sein
fetter Bauch gestattete. Sein dunkles breites Gesicht war blau
angelaufen. Er sah mich mit Augen an wie ein abgestochenes Kalb,
remmelte wie ein Ziegenbock und fl√ºsterte: ¬ªNimm nur den
Gnadenhammer¬†..., so¬†..., so¬†..., das schadet dir nicht¬†..., nimm nur
M√§derl¬†..., spritzen soll ich¬†..., das willst du auch¬†...? Also gut,
ich werde spritzen¬†..., werde dich salben¬†...¬´

¬ªHochw√ºrden¬´, fiel ich ihm ins Wort, ¬ªHochw√ºrden, ich hab' auch mit der
Brust dabei ges√ºndigt.¬´

¬ªWieso¬†...?¬´ Er glotzte mich fragend an.

¬ªWeil¬†..., ach¬†..., ach¬†..., mir kommt's schon wieder¬†..., weil ich mir
beim V√∂geln hab' immer die Duteln streicheln und k√ºssen und absuzeln
lassen.¬´ Ich sagte das, damit er es tue, denn ich f√ºhlte den Wunsch,
meine Br√ºste gepre√üt und gestreichelt zu bekommen.

Aber seine Fettleibigkeit hinderte ihn, auch meine Br√ºste zu bedienen.
Mit den H√§nden mu√üte er sich auf dem Bett st√ºtzen, und mit dem Kopf
erreichte er mich √ºberhaupt nicht.

¬ªDas kommt¬†..., sp√§ter¬†..., sp√§ter¬†..., will ich deine Duterln
hernehmen¬´, sagte er sto√üend. ¬ªLa√ü mich zuerst nur spritzen¬†...,
ach¬†..., ach¬†..., beweg dich nur, Muzerl, das ist mir angenehm¬†..., reib
nur dein Fotzerl, dein s√º√ües hin und her¬†..., ach du kannst es gut¬†...,
sehr gut kannst du's¬†..., la√ü mich nur ausspritzen, dann werd' ich deine
sch√∂nen kleinen Duteln schon noch hernehmen¬†..., so¬†..., mir
kommt's¬†..., heiliger Gott¬†..., das ist s√º√ü¬†...¬´ Und indem er so
stammelte, platzte ihm der Same los, und ein solcher Strom flutete aus
ihm zu mir her√ºber, da√ü es bei seinen letzten St√∂√üen laut quatschte.

Als er fertig war, sagte er mit W√ºrde: ¬ªDu hast geh√∂rt meine Tochter,
was ich gesprochen habe ... Siehe, ich habe die Reden des Erzfeindes und
des Verf√ºhrers nachgeahmt, in deinem Interesse¬†..., damit auch die
unfl√§tigen Worte, die du in buhlerischer Umarmung vernommen hast, ihre
b√∂se Gewalt √ºber dich verlieren.¬´

Ich sa√ü auf dem Bettrand und wischte mit meinem Sacktuch die
√úberschwemmung fort, die der Kooperator zwischen meinen Beinen
angerichtet hatte. Und ich merkte sehr wohl, wie er jetzt mir vorl√ºgen
wollte. Aber ich sagte nichts. Gev√∂gelt war eben gev√∂gelt, der
Kooperator war f√ºr mich jetzt wie der Herr Horak oder der Herr Ekhard.
Nur interessierte er mich doch mehr, weil er ja viel feiner war als
diese und weil ich bei alledem sehr viel Respekt vor ihm hatte. Und dann
auch, weil ich ja auch gern zu ihm hielt, da er f√ºr mich den Vorzug
hatte, mich doppelt zu erfreuen, erstens durch seinen Gnadenhammer und
zweitens durch seinen S√ºndenabla√ü, an den ich noch immer glaubte.

Er hatte sich wieder in den Gro√üvaterstuhl gesetzt und rief mich.

¬ªKomm jetzt¬´, sagte er noch schnaufend, ¬ªjetzt werde ich dir nach deinem
Willen die Duteln behandeln.¬´ Er kn√∂pfte mir das Kleid auf und nahm
meine runden kleinen Br√ºste heraus. Sie standen wie zwei Elfenbeinkugeln
von mir ab und trugen die Warzen, als l√§ge auf dem Elfenbein je eine
Himbeere. Der Kooperator mochte ein Freund von so frischem Obst sein,
denn er nahm in aller Eile eine Himbeere nach der andern in den Mund und
sutzelte sie ab, da√ü sie davon nur noch gl√§nzender wurden, wie manche
Obstverk√§ufer in Capri ihre Erdbeeren mit der Zunge ablecken, um ihnen
durch den Speichel einen appetitlichen Glanz zu verleihen.

Als er das mit vielem Grunzen und Schnaufen eine h√ºbsche Weile so
getrieben hatte, sagte er: ¬ªIst es so recht¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬´, antwortete ich, ¬ªso ist's recht¬†...¬´

¬ªNa, und bist denn du ganz faul gewesen wenn dir an der Brust gespielt
wurde?¬´ fragte er weiter, indem er meine Gspa√ülaberln auf und ab hupfen
lie√ü. ¬ªHast denn du gar nichts dabei getan? Hast du nicht mit der Nudel
gespielt?¬´

Nun wu√üte ich, was er wollte und begann, sein Geh√§nge zu traktieren. Es
war aber schlaff geworden und erhob sich nicht mehr.

¬ªSetz dich herauf¬†...¬´, befahl er mir.

Ich setzte mich vor ihm auf den Schreibtisch, so da√ü meine F√º√üe auf den
Knien sich st√ºtzten.

¬ªJetzt¬´, sagte er, ¬ªjetzt kommt das beste, die Hauptsache¬†...¬´

Ich wu√üte nicht was er meinte und sah ihn l√§chelnd an.

¬ªJa, meine Tochter¬´, fuhr er st√∂hnend fort, ¬ªjetzt will ich selbst dich
reinigen und alles austilgen, was deinen Scho√ü befleckt.¬´

Damit nahm er meine Kleider hoch, da√ü ich wieder ganz entbl√∂√üt war. Er
legte sich meine Schenkel √ºber seine Schultern, hatte seinen Kopf
zwischen meinen Beinen, und ich mu√üte mich mit den Ellbogen auf die
Schreibtischplatte st√ºtzen, damit ich nicht r√ºcklings auf den harten
Tisch zu liegen kam.

Er hatte seinen Mund meiner Spalte gen√§hert, und sein hei√üer Atem
bestrich mich dort. Ich wu√üte nicht, was er wollte, aber ich hoffte auf
etwas Angenehmes.

Wie ward mir, als ich seine dicken hei√üen Lippen auf meinen Schamlippen
sp√ºrte, als er mit seiner weichen, hei√üen Zunge einmal von unten her bis
oben hin meine Spalte auswischte. Ein nie gekanntes Gef√ºhl lie√ü mich
erbeben. Diese Wonne hatte ich noch nicht gesp√ºrt. Bisher lie√üen sich
die M√§nner immer von meinem Mund bedienen, aber dieser wackere Priester
war der erste, der mir auch seine Zunge lieh.

Ich zuckte mit den Hinterbacken und zog meine M√§nnerfalle zusammen, als
gelte es einen neuen St√∂√üer einzufangen.

Er hob den Kopf und fragte mich: ¬ªIst dir das angenehm¬†...?¬´

Vor Begierde zitternd und nach mehr verlangend sagte ich rasch: ¬ªJa,
Hochw√ºrden.¬´ Er fuhr wieder mit der Zunge √ºber mein Loch und √ºber meinen
Wollustweiser hin, so zart, da√ü die Wonne peinigend und begl√ºckend war.
Dann fragte er wieder: ¬ªHat dir das schon einer gemacht¬†...?¬´

¬ªNein¬´, sagte ich und hob den Popo, da√ü meine Muschel wie ein
dargereichter Becher an die Lippen gesetzt wurde.

¬ªDas reinigt dich¬´, sagte er, ¬ªdas nimmt alles von dir ab¬†...¬´

Ich fa√üte mit einer Hand keck seinen Kopf, erwischte ihn bei der Tonsur
und duckte ihn herunter, damit er von seinem Mund einen besseren
Gebrauch mache als reden.

Er fing nun an, zuerst meinen Kitzler zu bearbeiten. Mir war, als s√§√üe
alles, was Empfindung war, pl√∂tzlich dort unten, mein Mund, meine
Brustwarzen, das Innerste meiner Fut. Wo seine Zungenspitze mich
ber√ºhrte, schien mir Elektrizit√§t in den ganzen K√∂rper einzuschie√üen.
Ich verlor den Atem, das Zimmer drehte sich mit mir, und ich schlo√ü die
Augen.

Da lie√ü er pl√∂tzlich ab davon, glitschte tiefer und fuhr mir mit der
Zunge in die Einfahrt. Ich tanzte mit dem Popo einen Czardas auf dem
Schreibtisch. Denn was war das V√∂geln gegen diesen Reiz? Ich fuhr ihm,
indem ich mit dem Arsch auf- und absauste, mit meiner Spalte √ºber das
ganze Gesicht. Ich f√ºhlte seine Zunge bald tief in mich eindringen, bald
auf dem Kitzler zitternde Wirbel schlagen, bald seine Lippen an meiner
ganzen Geschichte saugen. Es kam mir, da√ü ich glaubte, mein Inneres
werde ausgeleert. Was mir da geschah, war besser noch als das beste
V√∂geln, und doch hatte ich dabei nur einen Gedanken, den Gedanken an
einen riesigen Schweif, der mir vorschwebte, den ich mir w√ºnschte, und
der in mich hineinfahren sollte bis zum Magen.

¬ªEs kommt mir¬†..., immerfort kommt's mir¬´, rief ich aus, ¬ªach, das ist
wie im Himmel, Hochw√ºrden¬†..., so gut ist mir's noch nie gewesen¬†...,
bitte¬†..., v√∂gel mich, Hochw√ºrden¬†..., gib mir deinen Schweif¬†..., v√∂gel
mich¬†..., nein, bleib¬†..., so¬†..., so¬†..., ach ich schrei¬†..., ich
schrei¬†...¬´

Ich f√ºhlte mich pl√∂tzlich umgeworfen, lag mit dem Kopf auf dem
Tintenfa√ü. Hochw√ºrden aber hatte sich erhoben. Sein Gesicht tauchte blau
angelaufen mit Schaum vor dem Mund vor mir auf.

¬ªKomm¬´, schnaufte er mir zu, ¬ªsetz dich auf mich¬†..., dann kannst du den
Schweif noch einmal haben.¬´

Er lag dann in seinem Gro√üvaterstuhl weit zur√ºckgelehnt. Ich hielt mich
an beiden Armlehnen fest und ritt auf der Spitze seiner Lanze, denn mehr
kam unter seinem dicken Bauch nicht zum Vorschein. Damit ich aber nicht
herunterfalle, hatte er meine beiden Br√ºste mit seinen F√§usten
umklammert, und so lie√üen wir die zweite Nummer abschnurren, die uns
allen beiden m√§chtig viel Vergn√ºgen bereitete.

Dann lie√ü er mich von seinem Knie herabgleiten und reichte mir ein
Handtuch. Wie ich mich abwischen wollte meinte er: ¬ªWart, Mauserl, du
wirst brunzen wollen¬†...¬´, und er brachte mir selbst einen riesigen
blauen Nachttopf herbei. Ich lie√ü mein Wasser da hinein, und all das
heilige √ñl, mit dem mich der Kooperator so reichlich gesalbt hatte.

Er stand dabei und kn√∂pfelte seine Hose zu. Dann machte ich mich
zurecht, und als ich mein Kleid wieder geschlossen hatte, nicht ohne,
da√ü der Kooperator vorher von meinen Br√ºsten t√§tschelnd Abschied nahm,
wartete ich der weiteren Dinge.

Aber es kam nichts. Der Kooperator sagte: ¬ªGeh jetzt, meine Tochter, ich
werde heute f√ºr dich beten, und morgen kommst du in der Fr√ºh zu mir in
die Kirche beichten¬†...¬´

Ich k√º√üte ihm die Hand und ging. Wie er mir das Vorgemach aufschlie√üen
wollte, klopfte es drau√üen.

Er √∂ffnete und eine Schulkameradin von mir stand drau√üen: ¬ªIch hab' heut
keine Zeit mehr¬´, sagte ihr Hochw√ºrden ziemlich unwirsch. ¬ªKomm
vielleicht morgen nachmittag¬†...¬´

Damit schob er auch mich hinaus und schlo√ü hinter uns zu.

Wir zwei M√§dchen gingen nun zusammen fort und sprachen nat√ºrlich
miteinander. Sie hie√ü Melanie und war die Tochter eines Gastwirts, und
obwohl sie auch nur dreizehn Jahre alt war, sah sie doch aus, als ob sie
selbst schon eine kleine Gastwirtin sei. Sie war sehr dick, so dick, da√ü
sie beim Gehen die Beine breit auseinandersetzte. Sie hatte einen
gro√üen, breiten Popo und so volle Br√ºste, da√ü sie weit von ihr
abstanden und sie hinderten, ihren Nabel zu sehen.

Wie wir die Treppe heruntergingen fragte sie mich: ¬ªWas hast du denn
beim hochw√ºrdigen Herrn gemacht¬†...?¬´

¬ªWas hast denn du bei ihm wollen¬†...?¬´ gab ich zur√ºck.

¬ªIch kann mir schon denken¬´, meinte sie, ¬ªwas es war¬†...¬´

¬ªNa, was soll's gewesen sein¬†...?¬´

¬ªGewi√ü eine Unkeuschheits-Beicht¬†...!¬´

Ich mu√üte lachen.

¬ªWarst schon oft bei ihm?¬´ fragte sie.

¬ªHeut zum erstenmal¬†..., und du?¬´

¬ªAch ich¬†...¬´, sie l√§chelte, ¬ªich war vielleicht schon zwanzigmal
oben¬†..., und die Ferdinger und die Gro√übauer und die Huser und die
Schurdl auch¬†...¬´

Sie nannte lauter Namen von Schulkameradinnen.

Ich war sehr erstaunt.

Melanie aber fuhr weiter: ¬ªHat er dir's auch mit dem Mund gemacht¬†...?¬´

¬ªDir¬†...?¬´ fragte ich vorsichtig.

¬ªNat√ºrlich¬´, sagte sie schnell. ¬ªEr macht mir's immer mit dem Mund¬†...,
einer jeden macht er's so¬†..., das ist wegen der Reinigung¬†..., und gut
ist das¬†..., nicht wahr¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬´, gestand ich, ¬ªsehr gut.¬´

¬ªHat's dir schon einer mit dem Mund gemacht¬†...?¬´ wollte sie wissen.

¬ªNein¬´, sagte ich, ¬ªdas war heut zum erstenmal¬†...¬´

Sie prahlte: ¬ªMir macht's immer unser Zahlkellner¬†..., sooft ich
will¬†..., ich brauch' nur in die Burschenkammer gehen¬†...¬´

¬ªUnd die andern Burschen¬†...?¬´ meinte ich.

¬ªAh, es kommt niemand herein, wenn wir drin sind¬†..., die wissen
schon¬†...¬´

¬ªWas?¬´ fragte ich perplex, ¬ªdie wissen das?¬´

¬ªNat√ºrlich¬´, erwiderte sie gleichm√ºtig, ¬ªdie pudern mich ja auch, wenn
ich will.¬´

Sie erz√§hlte mir: ¬ªWir haben einen Zahlkellner, einen Piccolo und einen
Schankburschen und dann den Kutscher, die schlafen alle in der
Burschenkammer. Und vor zwei Jahren, da bin ich mit dem Kutscher Johann
einmal nach Simmering gefahren. Na, und es war schon finster, und wie
wir √ºbers Feld kommen, da hab ich auf einmal seine Hand auf meinen
Duteln gesp√ºrt. Ich hab' schon damals so gro√üe Duteln gehabt wie du
heute. ¬ªJohann¬´, sag' ich zu ihm, ¬ªwas machen S' denn?¬´

Er gibt mir keine Antwort und la√üt das Pferd stehen, und fahrt mir in
die Kleider, so da√ü er die nackte Brust gehabt hat. ¬ªJohann¬´, sag' ich
ihm, ¬ªwas machen S' denn?¬´ Da hebt er mir die R√∂cke auf und griff mir an
die Fut. ¬ªWas wollen S' denn, Johann?¬´ sag' ich zu ihm, aber ich hab'
ganz gut gewu√üt, was er will. Die Ferdinger hat mir ja schon lang alles
gesagt, wie das ist, mit Mann und Frau, nur selber hab' ich's noch nicht
getan gehabt.¬´

¬ªWas wollen S' denn, Johann¬†...?¬´ frag' ich noch einmal.

Da l√§√üt er mich los und steigt vom Wagen. Und dann sagt er: ¬ªKommen S'
Fr√§ulein Melanie¬†...¬´, und hebt mich vom Bock herunter. Und gleich am
Weg legt er mich ins Getreide. Ich hab' mich gefreut, denn ich hab' mir
gedacht, jetzt werd ich's sehen, wie das ist, und ob mir die Ferdinger
die Wahrheit gesagt hat.

Wie ich so dalag, legt er sich gleich zwischen meine F√º√üe. ¬ªWas wollen
S' denn, Johann?¬´ frug ich. Aber er packt mich bei die Duteln, und im
selben Moment sp√ºr' ich, wie er mir hineinfuhr. Ich hab' schreien m√ºssen
vor Schmerz, aber er hielt mir den Mund zu. Und dann, wie er so hin- und
herg'fahren ist, hat's mir angefangen zu schmecken. Aber ich hab' nur zu
ihm gesagt: ¬ªWas machen S' denn, Johann?¬´ Er hat mir keine Antwort
gegeben, hat mir's hineingespritzt, und dann sind wir aufgestanden und
haben uns wieder auf den Bock gesetzt. -- Nach einer langen Weile erst,
sagte er: ¬ªDie Fr√§ul'n Melanie mu√ü sich zu Haus abwaschen, da√ü niemand
was von Blut merkt.¬´

¬ªWas f√ºr ein Blut?¬´ fragte ich.

¬ªNa¬´, sagt er, ¬ªweil die Fr√§ul'n Melanie noch eine Jungfrau war¬†...¬´

Ich h√§tte gern gewu√üt, wie das Ding ausschaut und wie es sich anf√ºhlt,
was er mir da hineingesteckt hat, aber ich traute mich nicht.

Da f√§ngt er, nachdem wir wieder ein St√ºck gefahren sind, an: ¬ªDie
Fr√§ul'n Melanie wird wohl nix verraten, was?¬´

Da hab' ich mich fest an ihn angelehnt, und hab' ihm in die Hosen
gegriffen und er hat mir seinen Schwanz gegeben, und mit dem hab' ich
gespielt, ohne da√ü wir ein Wort miteinander sprachen, bis die ersten
H√§user da waren.

Dann sagte er auf einmal: ¬ªDer Peter ist ein Lugenschippel.¬´

¬ªWarum?¬´ fragte ich.

¬ªNa, weil er mir erz√§hlt hat, er hat die Fr√§ul'n Melanie gev√∂gelt¬†...¬´

Ich bekam einen gro√üen Zorn und schwur dem Johann, da√ü mich der Peter
nicht anger√ºhrt habe. Der Peter war der Schankbursch.

Nach ein paar Tagen war ich im Stall, und da hat mich der Johann auf die
Futterkisten gelegt und mich gepempert. Aber damals ist der Schwanz noch
nicht so ganz tief hineingegangen wie jetzt.¬´

¬ªGeht er bei dir denn ganz hinein¬†...?¬´ sagte ich neidisch, ¬ªvon einem
Gro√üen der Schwanz?¬´

Sie lachte: ¬ªAber nat√ºrlich, schon lang, unser Zahlkellner, der Leopold,
der hat einen so gro√üen wie ein Hengst, und der geht bis auf'n Beutel
hinein, und der vom Kooperator auch¬†...¬´ Sie war stolz darauf.

¬ªDas glaub' ich nicht¬†...¬´, meinte ich.

¬ªWenn du's nicht glaubst, la√ü bleiben¬´, schmollte sie.

Nach einer kleinen Pause schlug sie mir vor: ¬ªWei√üt, wenn du's nicht
glaubst, komm mit zu mir, ich geh' sowieso in die Burschenkammer, weil
mir's der hochw√ºrdige Herr heut nicht gemacht hat, und wenn der Leopold
da ist, kannst du ja selbst es sehen. Die Ferdinger hat's auch nicht
geglaubt und hat auch schon einmal zugeschaut¬†...¬´

¬ªGut¬´, meinte ich darauf, ¬ªich geh' mit dir.¬´ Mich interessierte es,
dieses sch√∂ne, dicke M√§dchen mit den gro√üen Br√ºsten an der Arbeit zu
sehen, ich hoffte, endlich mit ihren Duteln spielen zu k√∂nnen. Denn von
jeher hatten Frauenbr√ºste einen gro√üen Reiz auf mich ge√ºbt. Und dann
hoffte ich, vielleicht zu einem neuen Schweif zu kommen und heute noch
eine Nummer zu machen, was mir nicht unlieb war.

Melanie erz√§hlte weiter: ¬ªWieder ein paar Tag' d'rauf, hab ich den
Johann gesucht und geh ins Burschenzimmer. Es war aber nur der
Schankbursch, der Peter, da. Und wie ich den seh', fallt mir die L√ºge
ein, die er von mir gesagt hat, und ich sag' ihm: `Sie Lugenschippel,
was haben Sie denn zum Johann √ºber mich geprahlt¬†...?¬¥ -- `Was denn?¬¥
meinte er l√§chelnd. Ich kam √ºber sein Lachen erst recht in Wut und
schnauz' ihn an: `Sie haben gesagt, da√ü Sie mich gev√∂gelt haben¬†...¬¥ Und
damit hab' ich mich nat√ºrlich nur selbst verraten, denn da hat der Peter
gleich gewu√üt, da√ü der Kutscher mich gepudert hat.

Das hab' ich ihm auch angemerkt, wie er mich so l√§chelnd angeschaut hat.
Dann sagte er: `Der Johann ist selbst ein L√ºgner¬†..., ich hab' nicht
gesagt, ich hab' die Fr√§ul'n Melanie gev√∂gelt¬†..., ich hab' nur gemeint,
ich m√∂cht' die Fr√§ul'n Melanie gern einmal verbimbsen¬†..., nur das hab'
ich ihm gesagt¬†..., und da ist doch nichts dabei¬†..., wenn doch die
Fr√§ul'n Melanie so viel sch√∂n ist¬†..., da kann sie doch nicht b√∂s' sein,
da√ü man sich das w√ºnscht¬†...¬¥ Damit kam er zu mir herbei und streichelte
mich auf der Brust. Mein Zorn war weg und v√∂geln wollte ich. Und wie er
mir sagte: `Gehn S' Fr√§ul'n, lassen S' mich dr√ºber¬¥, schaffte ich ihm,
er soll die T√ºr zuriegeln.

Na, und da hat er mich auf sein Bett gelegt und hat mich sch√∂n langsam
gev√∂gelt.¬´

¬ªPuderst du mit dem Piccolo auch?¬´ fragte ich.

¬ªMit dem Maxl?¬´ Sie lachte. ¬ªNat√ºrlich. Der hat mich ja einmal mit dem
Peter belauscht, und dann ist er mir am andern Tag nachgeschlichen, wie
ich auf den Abort gegangen bin, und da hat er mir gesagt, da√ü er alles
wei√ü und da√ü ich ihn lassen soll. Na, so hab' ich ihn halt gelassen. Wir
haben eine Stehpartie gemacht. Ist ja nix dabei.¬´

¬ªUnd wie ist's denn mit dem Leopold, mit dem Zahlkellner?¬´ wollte ich
wissen.

¬ªO der¬†...¬´, sie h√§ngte sich in mich ein. ¬ªWei√üt du, der Maxl hat mir
von dem erz√§hlt, da√ü er einen so langen Schweif hat, und da bin ich so
neugierig gewesen. Der Leopold darf immer bis zum Mittag schlafen, weil
er die Nacht am l√§ngsten auf ist, und da ist er Vormittag allein im
Burschenzimmer. Da bin ich halt einmal zu ihm hinauf.

Er war noch im Bett und hat geschlafen, und ich hab' die T√ºr verriegelt.
Er ist aufgewacht, und ich sag' ihm: `Wer wird denn so lang im Bett
sein¬†..., auf! auf!¬¥ -- `Lassen S' mich nur liegen¬†...¬¥, meinte er.
`Nein!¬¥ sag' ich und fing ihn zu kitzeln an. Und wie er so aushaut,
erwischt er mich bei der Dutel, und da bin ich ganz ruhig gworden und
hab' ihn nur angeschaut. Da packt er mich fester an und zieht mich zu
sich, und wie ich einmal bei ihm gelegen bin, hat er mir seinen Schweif
gleich in die Hand gegeben. Ich sag' dir¬†..., so lang ist der¬†...¬´

Sie zeigte mir die L√§nge mit der Hand.

¬ªEr hat zum V√∂geln angefangen, hat aber gleich aufgeh√∂rt. `Ich f√ºrcht'
mich, ich tu' Ihnen was, Fr√§ul'n, mit dem Salzstangel da¬¥, sagte er,
`wir werden es anders machen.¬¥ Na, und da ist er herunter und hat mich
zu schlecken angefangen, da√ü ich geglaubt hab', ich werd' n√§rrisch. Und
wie ich dann ganz hin war, sagt er: `Jetzt kann ich.¬¥ Und nimmt mir die
Duteln heraus, steckt seinen Schwanz dazwischen und v√∂gelt mich zwischen
der Brust, da√ü es mir dann bis ins Gesicht gespritzt hat¬†...¬´

¬ªWas?¬´ fragte ich sie, ¬ªder Zahlkellner macht dir's immer nur zwischen
der Brust¬†...?¬´

¬ªAch nein, jetzt nicht mehr¬†...¬´, lachte sie, ¬ªdas war vor zwei Jahren,
wie ich erst elf Jahre alt war¬†..., jetzt v√∂gelt er mich schon ganz ...
ich hab' dir doch gesagt, du kannst mitkommen, zuschauen¬†...¬´

Wir waren bei ihrem Haus angelangt und gingen durch die Wirtsstube.

¬ªLeopold¬´, sagte sie, ¬ªist der Vater zu Haus¬†...?¬´

¬ªNein¬´, antwortet er, ¬ªder Vater ist im Kaffeehaus.¬´

¬ªUnd die Mutter¬†...?¬´

¬ªDie schlaft noch¬†...¬´

¬ªUnd der Johann¬†...?¬´

Er lachte: ¬ªDer ist in Simmering¬†...¬´

Sie sagte: ¬ªAlso wir gehen hinauf¬†...¬´

Leopold verf√§rbte sich und fl√ºsterte: ¬ªIch komm' gleich¬†...¬´

Er war ein kleiner Mensch mit einem bartlosen, faltigen gelben Gesicht
und einer langen schiefen Nase. Ich fand ihn abscheulich, aber ich war
begierig, seine Stange zu sehen.

Wir gingen in das Burschenzimmer, einen gro√üen, wei√üget√ºnchten Raum, in
dem vier Eisenbetten standen.

Gleich darauf erschien Leopold.

Er war vor mir verlegen, aber Melanie warf sich auf das Bett und rief
ihn zu sich.

¬ªVielleicht¬´, sagte Leopold zu mir, ¬ªwill das Fr√§ulein auch ein bisserl
pudern¬†...?¬´

Dann kniete er nieder, schlug Melanie die Kleider zur√ºck und vergrub
sein Gesicht in ihren Scho√ü.

Ich setzte mich ihr zu H√§upten und sah, wie sie die Augen verdrehte.

¬ªWart¬´, sagte ich, ¬ªich werd' dir auch was tun¬†...¬´, und ich fiel √ºber
sie her, ri√ü ihr die Kleider auf und war ganz begeistert von ihrer
Brust. Sie hatte zwei Duteln, so gro√ü wie die von Klementine, aber die
schwappten nicht weich hin und her, sondern standen fest und hart wie
zwei K√ºrbisse so gro√ü von ihr weg, und dazu hatte sie kleine rosarote
W√§rzchen.

Wenn man ihre Brust dr√ºckte und pre√üte, so viel man nur wollte, sie
schnellte immer elastisch in die H√∂he.

Ich bearbeitete sie mit meinen H√§nden und zuletzt begann ich, die Warzen
zu k√ºssen und zu saugen.

Sie kreischte unter mir, warf sich unter Leopolds Futk√ºssen mit dem Popo
hoch empor.

¬ªDas halt' ich nicht aus¬†..., das halt' ich nicht aus¬´, schrie sie, ¬ªo
Gott¬†..., wie gut ist das¬†..., ja¬†..., schleck nur die Dutel¬†...,
schleck sie nur¬†..., Jesus, wenn ich nur k√∂nnt'¬†..., wenn ich nur
k√∂nnt', ich m√∂cht' auch was tun¬†..., ich m√∂cht' dir's auch
schlecken¬†..., warum denn nicht?¬´ sagte sie pl√∂tzlich mitten unter ihrem
Kreischen, ¬ªes ist doch nichts dabei¬†..., wenn ich nur deine Fut
erwischen k√∂nnte¬†..., ich m√∂cht' dir's machen, wie der Leopold ...
Ah¬†..., ah ... ah¬†...¬´ Sie schrie so laut, da√ü ich Angst bekam, ihre
Brust loslie√ü und meinte:

¬ªEs wird vielleicht jemand h√∂ren¬†...¬´

Leopold h√∂rte auf und sagte: ¬ªDa h√∂rt kein Mensch was.¬´

Der Speichel und der Futsaft tropfte ihm von den Lippen. Er wischte sich
ab und meinte: ¬ªJetzt wird sie gleich noch mehr schreien¬†...¬´

Damit schickte er sich an, sich auf Melanie zu legen.

Sie rief: ¬ªSchau dir jetzt seinen Schweif an.¬´

Ich glitt zu Leopold hin, der sich, auf Melanie liegend, bereitwillig so
hoch aufhob, da√ü ich bequem alles sehen konnte. Es war die l√§ngste
Stange, die ich je erblickt hatte, und sie war so gebogen wie eine
Extrawurst. In meiner Verwunderung griff ich danach und konnte mir's
nicht versagen, diesen Spargel so zu behandeln, wie man Spargel
behandelt, n√§mlich den Kopf in den Mund zu nehmen.

Leopold spielte mit Melanies Br√ºsten und lie√ü sie nicht merken, was ich
unten tat. Aber er zuckte so heftig und mit solcher Kraft, da√ü er mir
die Kinnladen auseinandertrieb.

Ich spielte mit der Zunge daran, rieb mit der Hand die √ºbrig bleibende
Stange und wunderte mich jedesmal, wie weit der Weg war, den ich von der
Eichel bis zur Wurzel zur√ºckzulegen hatte.

Da sagte Melanie: ¬ªAlso, la√ü ihn jetzt v√∂geln, Pepi.¬´

Ich mu√üte ihn freigeben und schaute mir noch beneidend Melanies Fut an.
Ihre dicken, wei√üen Schenkel gingen in einen breiten, kugelrunden Popo
√ºber, und wie eine schwarze Rose lag ihre Muschel auf den Polstern. Sie
stand weit offen und gl√§nzte an ihren R√§ndern von Feuchtigkeit, und
sooft sie ihre Schamlippen zusammenzog, kam ein wei√üer Tropfen heraus
und hing wie eine Perle auf dem dunklen Haar.

¬ªPepi, Pepi¬´, rief sie, ¬ªschau jetzt, ob er hineingeht, wenn du's nicht
glaubst¬†...¬´

Schaun konnte ich nicht, aber greifen, und so suchte ich mit der Hand,
wie sein Anker sich immer tiefer und tiefer in den Grund bohrte, bis mir
nichts mehr in der Hand blieb als die beiden Spulen, auf denen sein Zaun
aufgestellt war.

Melanie stie√ü langanhaltende Schreie aus: ¬ªHah¬†..., hah¬†..., haaah¬†...¬´

Dann sch√∂pfte sie Atem und sagte: ¬ªNur beim Leopold mu√ü ich so
schreien¬†..., weil's mir¬†..., da immer kommt¬†..., hah¬†..., hah!¬´

Leopold v√∂gelte wie eine Maschine. Sein Popo flog hoch in die H√∂he und
senkte sich tief herab. Weil aber Melanie ihn mit ihren Beinen eng
umschlang, wurde sie mit hinauf- und heruntergerissen von jedem Sto√ü,
und das ganze Bett wackelte unter dieser Ersch√ºtterung. Ich kroch wieder
neben ihnen in die H√∂he, bis ich mit meinem Popo auf dem Kopfpolster
sa√ü. Und ich sah, wie Leopold beide Br√ºste so zusammenpre√üte, da√ü die
Warzen ganz beieinander waren und sich ber√ºhrten, und beide Warzen nahm
er auf einmal in den Mund. Ich hob meine R√∂cke auf und dachte, etwas
werde ich doch wohl abbekommen. Melanie bemerkte es und sagte: ¬ªSchleck
sie auch¬†...¬´

Leopold drehte sein Gesicht zu mir, ich bot ihm meine offene Muschel
dar, und sogleich begann er mit der Zunge einen Wirbel auf meinen
Kitzler zu schlagen, da√ü ich vor Wollust gesch√ºttelt mich zur√ºcklegte.
Leopold war ein K√ºnstler. Er konnte seine Zunge beinahe so steif machen
wie seinen Spargel, und so stie√ü er mir sie in die H√∂hle, im selben Takt
und nach der Melodie, die er auf Melanies Fummel unten spielte. Ich
wu√üte gar nicht, was ich vor Wonne tun sollte und verhielt mich still,
bis es uns dreien zugleich kam.

Leopold verschwand sofort, und wir richteten uns noch zurecht, ehe wir
gleichfalls die Burschenstube verlie√üen.

Am andern Morgen, nach diesem f√ºr mich so ereignisreichen Tage, ging ich
zur Kirche, um zu beichten.

Der Kooperator fragte mich: ¬ªAlso, du hast Unkeuschheit getrieben mit
vielen M√§nnern¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬´, sagte ich.

¬ªDu hast dich v√∂geln lassen¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬†...¬´

¬ªDu hast die m√§nnlichen Geschlechtsteile in den Mund genommen?¬´

¬ªJa¬†...¬´

¬ªDu hast mit der Hand dran gespielt¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬†...¬´

¬ªHast du noch was getan?¬´

¬ªJa¬†...¬´

¬ªWas?¬´

¬ªIch hab' mir's r√ºckw√§rts hineinstecken lassen¬†...¬´

¬ªR√ºckw√§rts¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬†...¬´

¬ªDoch nicht ins Arschloch¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa, Hochw√ºrden¬†...¬´

¬ªDas hast du gestern vergessen¬†...¬´

¬ªHochw√ºrden haben mich nicht gefragt¬†...¬´

Er dachte nach: ¬ªDa hab' ich leider selbst daran vergessen. Hast du noch
was getan?¬´

¬ªJa¬†...¬´

¬ªWas denn noch¬†...?¬´

¬ªIch hab' mir die Fut ausschlecken lassen.¬´

Er sagte streng: ¬ªDas brauchst du nicht zu beichten, das war keine
S√ºnd¬†...¬´

¬ªHochw√ºrden¬´, meinte ich, ¬ªich mein' ja nicht Sie¬†..., es war wer
anderer¬†...¬´

Er herrschte mich an: ¬ªDu hast mir aber doch gesagt, da√ü dich niemand
mehr geschleckt hat¬†...¬´

¬ªNein¬´, sagte ich, ¬ªaber gestern nachmittag hat mir's noch jemand
getan¬†...¬´

¬ªWer denn?¬´ Er war sehr erstaunt.

¬ªDer Leopold¬†...¬´

¬ªWer ist denn das¬†...?¬´

¬ªDer Zahlkellner von der Melanie¬†...¬´

¬ªJa, wieso denn?¬´

Ich beichtete alles.

Er sch√ºttelte den Kopf: ¬ªHast du noch was getan¬†..., vielleicht mit
weiblichen Geschlechtsteilen gespielt¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬†..., mit den Br√ºsten von der Melanie, und noch mit vielen
anderen¬†...¬´

¬ªUnd mit deinem Bruder hast du Blutschande getrieben?¬´

Ich wu√üte nicht, was er meinte, sagte aber ¬ªJa¬´, um ihn nicht zu
erz√ºrnen.

Er gab mir eine gro√üe Anzahl Vater unser, englischen Gru√ü und Glauben
als Bu√üe zu beten auf, nachdem er mich noch gefragt hatte, ob ich meine
S√ºnden bereue, und nachdem ich dann das bejaht hatte.

Dann sagte er: ¬ªGeh hin und s√ºndige nicht mehr, deine S√ºnden sind dir
vergeben. Bessere dich! Wenn du jedoch wieder in S√ºnde f√§llst, dann
verzweifle nicht, komme zu mir, und ich werde dich wieder reinigen. So
du aber irgendeiner Seele davon ein Wort verratest, ist dein ewiges
Seelenheil verloren, und du wirst in der H√∂lle vom Teufel auf gl√ºhenden
Kohlen gebraten werden.¬´

Ich verlie√ü den Beichtstuhl mit leichtem Herzen.

In der Schule aber bemerkte ich einige Wochen lang, da√ü mich der
Katechet mit eigent√ºmlichen Blicken ansah. Ich f√ºrchtete mich vor ihm
und glaubte, er wolle mich besonders sekkieren.

Er spazierte zwischen den B√§nken hin und her, und wie er bei mir
vor√ºberkam, legte er mir pl√∂tzlich die Hand auf das Haar, so sacht und
freundlich, da√ü ich bei dieser Ber√ºhrung heftig zusammenschauderte. Er
streichelte mich noch am R√ºcken und sprach dabei zur Klasse weiter. Ich
f√ºhlte mich sehr ausgezeichnet und blickte ihm liebevoll nach, als er
wieder seine Promenade fortsetzte.

In der n√§chsten Stunde pr√ºfte er. Wir mu√üten die Fragen, die er gab,
aufschreiben, und eine war immer am Katheder oben, die Fragen zu
beantworten. Auch das mu√üten wir aufschreiben. Er rief zwei M√§dchen auf,
und dann mich. Ich mu√üte auf sein Gehei√ü vor ihm stehen, mit dem R√ºcken
gegen den Lehrpult, das meine Unterseite den Blicken der Klasse verbarg.
Er sa√ü, und ich stand zwischen seinen Beinen.

¬ªDu hast gewi√ü recht brav gelernt?¬´ meinte er und fa√üte mich bei der
Hand, aber so, da√ü die meinige sein Hosent√ºrl ber√ºhrte.

Ich ahnte nicht, da√ü er das beabsichtigt hatte.

Aber er bewegte meine Hand, da√ü sie wie zuf√§llig an seinem Hosent√ºrl
hin- und herfuhr. Jetzt f√ºhlte ich, wie etwas Hartes darin zuckte.

Er schaute mich an. Dann legte er meine Hand ganz fest auf sein
Hosent√ºrl, und ich konnte seinen Schwanz durch das Tuch f√ºhlen.

Er lie√ü meine Hand frei, und ich zog sie nicht zur√ºck.

Darauf sah er mich nochmals an, und jetzt wu√üte ich, was er wollte. Ich
war ganz aufgeregt vor Stolz und j√§her Geilheit und griff zu, das hei√üt,
ich schlo√ü leise meine Finger, so da√ü ich seinen Kolben jetzt, wenn auch
nur im Futeral, halb umschlo√ü.

Er begann ein langes Diktat, das, wie ich merkte, nur den Zweck hatte,
die andern zu besch√§ftigen. Dabei schauten wir uns fortw√§hrend in die
Augen, und auf einmal kn√∂pfte er die Hose auf und seine Triebfeder
sprang nackt heraus.

Sie war ganz krumm wie die Nase des Katecheten, aber furchtbar dick und
brennend hei√ü.

Immer noch sahen wir uns an, und so begann ich leise, ganz leise zu
reiben, und seinen Bewegungen, damit niemand etwas merken solle, zu
folgen.

Er wurde bla√ü im Gesicht und behutsam fuhr er mir unter die R√∂cke, so
geschickt, da√ü niemand eine Bewegung an ihm wahrgenommen h√§tte.

Ich trat ein klein wenig mit den F√º√üen auseinander und schob den Bauch
vor, um ihm Zugang zu verschaffen.

Er fand sofort die richtigen Stellen und kitzelte mich so zart, da√ü es
mir hei√ü und kalt √ºber den R√ºcken lief.

Aug in Aug standen wir.

Dabei sprach er immer weiter und weiter sein frommes Diktat.

Endlich lie√ü er mich los und schickte mich in die Bank.

Dann rief er die Ferdinger.

Sie trat auf's Katheder, und ich pa√üte von meinem Sitz verstohlen,
aber scharf auf. Ich sah, wie sie sich von selbst zwischen seine Beine
stellte, und weil sie ungeschickt war, merkte ich gleich, da√ü sie an
seinem Schwanz herumspielte und er an ihrer Muschel. Sie war ganz
erhitzt.

Gleich darauf rief er wieder mich.

¬ªBring dein Schreibheft mit¬†...¬´

Als ich bei ihm war, sagte er: ¬ªDu kannst hier schreiben.¬´

Ich drehte ihm den R√ºcken, beugte mich stehend √ºber das Pult und wu√üte,
jetzt wird etwas anderes geschehen.

Und richtig, wie ich so vor ihm stand, und er hinter mir sa√ü, hob er
langsam meine Kleider auf.

Ich wollte ihm behilflich sein und reckte ihm den Popo entgegen.

Immer weiter dr√ºckend suchte er mit seinem Schwanz, den er schon parat
hatte, meine √ñffnung.

Auch dabei wollte ich ihm helfen und kam ihm mit ganz unmerklichen
Drehungen, so wie ich konnte, entgegen.

Wie er nun mit seinem Schwanzkopf an meinem Eingang angelangt war,
dr√ºckte er mich mit den H√§nden nieder und gab mir zu verstehen, ich
sollte mich draufsetzen.

Ich begriff die Situation, da√ü n√§mlich er ja nicht zusto√üen konnte, ohne
sich zu verraten.

So lie√ü ich mich langsam auf seiner Stange nieder, da√ü sie so tief als
m√∂glich eindrang, dann hob ich mich, lie√ü mich wieder nieder, und
verrichtete so f√ºr ihn das Gesch√§ft des Sto√üens.

Er beugte sich vor, als ob er mir beim Schreiben zuschauen wollte. Dabei
legte er die Hand flach auf den Tisch.

Auch das verstand ich, und mich fester an den Tisch beugend, legte ich
ihm meine Brust in die Hand, die er durch meine d√ºnne Bluse sehr gut
durchf√ºhlen konnte. Er pre√üte sie leise und streichelte unmerklich die
Warzen, die sich aufgerichtet hatten.

Mir war die Situation, die Anwesenheit so vieler Kinder, und der
Gedanke, da√ü der Katechet es war, der mich v√∂gelte, der lange Zeit so
sehr gef√ºrchtete Katechet, eine Ursache, meine Geilheit und meine
Aufregung zu vermehren. Dazu kam, da√ü ich mich nicht r√ºhren durfte, da√ü
es nicht m√∂glich war, sich zu mucksen, weil sonst alles verloren gewesen
w√§re.

Ich rieb also seinen Kl√∂ppel in meinem M√∂rser hin und her, so gut ich
konnte. Nur als es mir kam, vermochte ich nicht ganz langsam zu bleiben,
sondern wurde vorsichtig ein wenig schneller und mutiger. Es tat mir
weh, denn sein Schwanz war sehr dick, und ich hatte es doch bei aller
Vorsicht so getrieben, da√ü er beinahe zur H√§lfte in mir steckte. Er
machte meiner Schnelligkeit aber ein Ende, indem er mich mit der freien
Hand zum ruhigen Sitzen n√∂tigte. So bohrte ich mir ihn nur so tief als
m√∂glich hinein, lie√ü mir's kommen und schnappte dabei nat√ºrlich mit der
Fut so fest es ging zusammen.

Das mochte auch ihm den Saft in die H√∂he treiben, denn pl√∂tzlich
sprudelte er so hei√ü hervor, da√ü es mir gleich ein zweitesmal kam. Er
diktierte ruhig immer weiter, w√§hrend er spritzte. Ich hatte nat√ºrlich
kein Wort verstanden, noch geschrieben.

Als er ausgespritzt war, glitschte er von selbst heraus. Dann sp√ºrte
ich, wie er mir das Kleid in Ordnung brachte und h√∂rte ihn sagen: ¬ªDu
kannst in die Bank gehen.¬´

Gleich darauf war die Stunde aus.

Als wir aus der Schule gingen, kamen die Ferdinger und die Melanie zu
mir.

¬ªHeut hat dich der Katechet gev√∂gelt¬†...¬´, sagte sie mir.

¬ªHabt ihr was gesehen?¬´ fragte ich sie.

¬ªNein, aber das hei√üt ja¬†...¬´, lachte die Ferdinger.

Und Melanie meinte: ¬ªDas kennen wir schon¬†...¬´

¬ªMich hat er noch nie gev√∂gelt¬†...¬´, sagte die Ferdinger, ¬ªich hab' ihm
immer nur einen herunterg'rissen.¬´

Sie war ein hageres, unsch√∂nes Ding. Nur zwei kleine, spitze Br√ºste
fielen an ihr auf, weil sie so frech aus ihren Kleidern hervorstachen,
und ihr breites Untergestell.

¬ªMich pudert er schon seit vorigem Jahr¬´, meinte Melanie.

Jetzt war offenbar ich an der Reihe.

Er behielt mich auch einmal nach der Schule da.

Kaum hatten die M√§dchen das Lehrzimmer verlassen, als er mich auf das
Podium rief. Ohne ein Wort zu sagen, gab er mir seinen Schwanz in die
Hand, und ich bem√ºhte mich, ihn zufriedenzustellen, jetzt, da ich mich
in meinen Bewegungen nicht zu genieren hatte.

Nachdem er sich sein Bajonett so lange hatte putzen lassen, bis er
glaubte, da√ü es nun blank genug sei, und nachdem er mir mit den Fingern
die Scheide ausgewischt hatte, damit es dann nicht wieder staubig werde,
lie√ü er mich auf sich reiten.

Es war sehr gut, wie er das machte. Mit der einen Hand, die er auf
meinen R√ºcken legte, pre√üte er mich an sich, mit der andern Hand fuhr er
mir auf der Brust herum, und dabei k√º√üte er mich so sanft und z√§rtlich
auf den Mund, da√ü ich ganz ger√ºhrt davon wurde.

Und weil er sich jetzt vor niemanden mehr zu verbergen brauchte, bekam
ich seine St√∂√üe zu sp√ºren, die mir schier das Kreuz brachen. In f√ºnf
Minuten war alles vor√ºber. Er lie√ü seine Font√§ne springen, und ich zog
meine Schleu√üe auf. Dann konnte ich nach Hause gehen.

Mit diesem Katecheten passierte etwas, was mir in der Erinnerung oft
leid tat, denn ich hatte ihn gern.

In einer der untern Klassen war ein kleines M√§dchen von auffallender
Sch√∂nheit. Sie war die Tochter eines Bauarbeiters und etwa acht Jahre
alt. Sie war selbst f√ºr ihr Alter klein, aber sehr breit, und hatte ein
bl√ºhendes Engelsgesicht. Rote Wangen und blonde Locken. Aber sie war
beinahe so breit als sie hoch war, ungew√∂hnlich fleischig und hatte
schon Ans√§tze von Busen.

Dieses M√§dchen nun hatte der gute Katechet vorgenommen, hatte ihm auf
dem Katheder das Bajonett putzen, den Kl√∂ppel schwingen, den Spargel
putzen gelernt, und hatte seine kleine, nackte, fleischige Vogelschale
mit dem besten M√§nnerschaum gef√ºllt.

Die Kleine mochte das f√ºr ein angenehmes Kinderspiel gehalten haben,
kurz, sie erz√§hlte es ihrer Mutter, diese wieder machte ein gro√ües
Geschrei und beichtete diese Schauderm√§r ihrem Gatten, und der Gatte
wieder, der ohnehin eine Wut auf die Pfaffen hatte, lief zur Polizei.

Eine Untersuchung wurde eingeleitet. Mein armer Katechet wurde
verhaftet, und alsbald wurde auch in der Schule Umfrage nach den anderen
Opfern gehalten.

Die Kinder zeigten sich gegenseitig an, und eines Tages bekam auch mein
Vater eine Vorladung, mit mir auf dem Kommissariat zu erscheinen.

Als wir hinkamen, war eine ganze Versammlung von Kindern da, mit ihren
M√ºttern und V√§tern. Die Gro√üen legten sich keinen Zwang vor uns auf und
klagten einander ihr Leid.

Mein Vater erfuhr erst hier, was los sei, war aber ganz still und fragte
mich nur, ob es wahr sei.

Ich gab ihm keine Antwort, ich sch√§mte mich.

Man erfuhr eine Menge Geschichten vom Herrn Katecheten. Da waren auch
ganz kleine Kinder aus der ersten Klasse, die auf Befragen erz√§hlten,
der Herr Katechet habe ihnen seinen Pipihahn in den Mund gegeben und
habe dann Wiwi gemacht. Die Entr√ºstung war gro√ü.

Melanie war mit ihrem Vater da, der aber die Geschichte sehr ruhig nahm,
und seiner Tochter, wenn sie erz√§hlen wollte, immer nur ¬ªHalt's Maul¬´
zuschrie. Die Leute sahen sie an und meinten, bei ihr sei es kein
Wunder, denn sie sei ja eigentlich gar kein Kind mehr, sondern schon
eine erwachsene Person.

Endlich wurden wir vor den Kommiss√§r gerufen. Es war noch ein Herr da,
ein Arzt, wie sich sp√§ter zeigte.

Der Kommiss√§r, ein junger h√ºbscher Mensch, hatte immer M√ºhe, sein Lachen
zu verbei√üen. Ich aber zitterte vor Angst.

Er fragte mich: ¬ªHat dir der Katechet etwas getan¬†...?¬´

¬ªNein¬´, sagte ich, ¬ªgetan hat er mir nichts¬†...¬´

¬ªIch meine, ob er dich anger√ºhrt hat¬†..., du wei√üt schon wie¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬†...¬´

¬ªWo hat er dich anger√ºhrt¬†...?¬´

¬ªDa¬†...¬´ Ich zeigte sch√ºchtern auf mein Mittelst√ºck.

¬ªUnd was hat er noch getan¬†...?¬´

¬ªNichts¬†...¬´

¬ªHat er dir nichts in die Hand gegeben¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬†...¬´

¬ªNa also¬†..., was denn?¬´

Ich schwieg.

¬ªNa, ich wei√ü schon¬´, sagte der Kommiss√§r. ¬ªUnd hat er das Dingsda¬†...,
hat er das vielleicht dorthin auch gegeben¬†...?¬´ Er deutete auf meine
Eingangsstelle.

¬ªJa¬†...¬´

¬ªGanz hinein¬†...?¬´

¬ªNein, nicht ganz¬†...¬´

¬ªAlso nur ein bisserl¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬†..., die H√§lfte¬†...¬´

Der Kommiss√§r lachte laut auf, der Doktor lachte. Mein Vater sah mich an
und schwieg.

¬ªWo hat er dich noch anger√ºhrt¬†...?¬´

¬ªDa¬†...¬´ Ich zeigte auf meine Brust. ¬ªNa.¬´ Der Kommiss√§r blickte
zweifelhaft hin, ¬ªich wei√ü nicht¬´, sagte er zum Arzt, ¬ªich wei√ü nicht,
Herr Doktor¬†..., ob da ein Anla√ü f√ºr ihn war.¬´ Der Arzt kam auf mich zu,
packte mich gesch√§ftsm√§√üig an den Br√ºsten, griff daran herum und meinte
dann: ¬ªOh, genug¬†..., ganz genug.¬´

Mein Vater schaute verwundert auf meinen Busen.

¬ªNa, und sag mir einmal¬´, fragte der Kommiss√§r weiter, ¬ªhast du dich
nicht gewehrt?¬´

¬ªWas, bitte¬†...?¬´

¬ªIch meine, hast du ihm nicht die Hand weggesto√üen?¬´

¬ªNein.¬´

¬ªUnd warum hast du denn eigentlich seinen¬†..., sein Dingsda
angegriffen?¬´

¬ªWeil's der Herr Katechet gewollt hat¬†...¬´

¬ªSo¬†..., so¬†..., aber gezwungen hat er dich nicht¬†...?¬´

Z√∂gernd erwiderte ich: ¬ªNein¬†...¬´ Aber ich merkte, da√ü die Frage f√ºr
mich gef√§hrlich sei.

¬ªAlso warum hast du dir denn das alles tun lassen¬†...?¬´

¬ªSo, weil der Herr Katechet gewollt hat¬†...¬´

¬ªJa, warum hast du denn nicht gesagt, bitte Herr Katechet, das mag ich
nicht¬†...?¬´

¬ªWeil ich mich nicht getraut hab'¬†...¬´

¬ªAlso aus Respekt und aus Angst vor dem Herrn Katecheten¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬´, rief ich erleichtert, ¬ªaus Angst¬†...¬´

Aber der Kommiss√§r lie√ü nicht nach: ¬ªSag mir, und hast du ihm keinen
Anla√ü gegeben¬†..., hast du nie gesagt: `ich will's machen¬†...¬¥, oder ihn
so angeschaut¬†..., so¬†...?¬´ Der Kommiss√§r machte verliebte Augen.

Ich mu√üte in all meiner Angst l√§cheln, aber ich sagte ¬ªNein¬´.

¬ªUnd jetzt¬†...¬´, fuhr der Kommiss√§r fort, ¬ªjetzt sag mir noch eins, aber
die reine Wahrheit, verstehst du! Die reine Wahrheit¬†..., war dir das,
was dir der Herr Katechet getan hat, angenehm¬†...?¬´

Ich schwieg voll Angst.

¬ªIch meine¬´, wiederholte er, ¬ªhast du gern mit seinem, mit dem Dingsda
gespielt?¬´

¬ªO nein!¬´ beteuerte ich eifrig.

¬ªOder, -- aber ich will die Wahrheit wissen¬†...¬´, sprach er weiter,
¬ªoder wenn er dir das Dingsda hineingesteckt hat, war dir das angenehm,
oder hat's dir weh getan¬†...?¬´

¬ªWeh hat's mir manchmal getan, aber nicht immer¬´, gab ich zu.

¬ªAlso manchmal hat's auch wohlgetan¬†...?¬´ forschte er scharfen Tones.

¬ªJa¬´, platzte ich heraus, ¬ªmanchmal¬†...¬´, und stotternd f√ºgte ich hinzu,
¬ªaber nur¬†..., selten¬†...¬´

Der Kommiss√§r l√§chelte, mein Vater sah mich erstaunt und zornig an.

¬ªAlso weiter, Kleine¬´, setzte der Kommiss√§r fort, ¬ªes hat dir wohlgetan,
und du hast's also gern gemacht¬†..., was?¬´

¬ªNein¬´, widersprach ich, aus Furcht vor meinem Vater, ¬ªich hab's nicht
gern gemacht¬†...¬´

¬ªJa, aber du sagst ja doch selbst, da√ü dir's wohl getan hat¬†...?¬´

¬ªDa kann ich nichts daf√ºr¬†...¬´, rief ich aus, ¬ªwenn das so hin und
her¬†...¬´

Er unterbrach mich: ¬ªSchon gut, schon gut ... Du hast es also nicht gern
gemacht und es war dir nur unwillk√ºrlich angenehm¬†..., was?¬´

¬ªJa¬´, nickte ich.

¬ªBitte, Herr Doktor¬´, wandte sich der Kommiss√§r an den Arzt, ¬ªwollen Sie
die Sache konstatieren¬†...¬´

Ich wu√üte nicht, was geschehen solle, als der Arzt mich aufforderte,
mich auf einen erh√∂hten Stuhl zu setzen. Er schlug mir die R√∂cke in die
H√∂he, griff mir an die Fut, und spreizte sie mit den Fingern, dann
sp√ºrte ich, wie er etwas Hartes hineinsteckte, und zog es dann wieder
heraus.

¬ªDie Sache stimmt¬´, sagte er. ¬ªDas Kind hat Verkehr gehabt mit ihm.¬´

Verwirrt und verlegen stieg ich wieder herab.

¬ªSag mir jetzt¬´, meinte der Kommiss√§r, ¬ªist es dir bekannt, ob der
Katechet es mit anderen M√§dchen auch so gemacht hat?¬´

¬ªEs sind ja so viele drau√üen im Vorzimmer¬†...¬´, erwiderte ich.

Er lachte wieder: ¬ªDas wei√ü ich schon, du sollst mir nur sagen, ob du
selbst was geh√∂rt oder gesehen hast¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬´, entgegnete ich. ¬ªDie Melanie Hofer und die Ferdinger, die haben's
mir selber gesagt.¬´

¬ªUnd hat er es mit ihnen auch so gemacht wie mit dir¬†...?¬´

¬ªNein¬´, sagte ich lebhaft, ¬ªdie Ferdinger hat er nicht gev√∂gelt¬†...¬´

Der Kommiss√§r sagte: ¬ªKennst du das Wort vom Katecheten?¬´

Ich war verlegen: ¬ªNein, von ihm nicht¬†...¬´

¬ªVon wem denn?¬´ wollte er wissen.

¬ªAch nur so¬†..., aus der Schule¬†..., von den anderen¬†...¬´

¬ªVon der Hofer oder von der Ferdinger¬†...?¬´

¬ªNein¬†...¬´

¬ªVon wem denn?¬´

¬ªIch wei√ü nicht mehr¬†...¬´

¬ªAlso du sagst, die Ferdinger hat er nicht gev√∂gelt¬†...?¬´

¬ªNein¬†..., mit der hat er sich nur gespielt¬†...¬´

¬ªAber die Hofer¬†...¬´

¬ªJa¬†..., die hat er oft gev√∂gelt¬†...¬´

¬ªHast du's gesehen?¬´

¬ªJa, einmal hab' ich's gesehen¬†...¬´

¬ªUnd die andernmale¬†...?¬´

¬ªNa, sie hat mir's erz√§hlt¬†...¬´

¬ªHerr Mutzelbecher¬´, sagte der Kommiss√§r zu meinem Vater im ernsten Ton,
¬ªes tut mir leid, da√ü Sie so Trauriges haben h√∂ren m√ºssen. Es ist sehr
beklagenswert, da√ü ein gewissenloser und verirrter Priester Ihrer
Tochter die Unschuld genommen hat, aber tr√∂sten Sie sich, die Kleine ist
jung, niemand wird etwas davon erfahren und durch eine streng moralische
Erziehung k√∂nnen Sie b√∂se Folgen hoffentlich verhindern.¬´

Wir gingen nach Hause. Ich war in diesem Moment √ºberzeugt, da√ü der
Katechet mir meine Unschuld genommen hat. Er ist zu einer schweren
Strafe verurteilt worden, und es wurde ihm besonders hart angerechnet,
da√ü er Melanie und mich verf√ºhrt hatte. Wenn ich bedenke, da√ü an uns
nichts mehr zu verderben war und da√ü er gewi√ü bei noch vielen anderen
M√§dchen nicht der erste gewesen ist, der ihnen einen Schwanz zu spielen
gab, tut er mir herzlich leid.

Die Geschichte mit dem Katecheten ist aber f√ºr mein ganzes Leben
entscheidend geworden, wie ich im weiteren Verlaufe der Begebenheiten
zeigen werde. Denn trotz dieser Kindergeschichten w√§re ich vielleicht
eine brave Frau geworden, wie Melanie es wurde, die heute mit einer
Schar von Kindern im Gasthaus ihres Vaters sitzt, oder wie manche andere
von meinen damaligen Genossinnen, denen diese fr√ºhzeitigen
Ausschreitungen nichts geschadet haben.

Sie hielten sich, als das Jungfrauengef√ºhl in ihnen erwachte, und als
besonders die Angst vor dem Kinderkriegen sich einstellte, vom
Geschlechtsverkehr zur√ºck, wurden keusch, wurden dann von einem
ernsthaften Geliebten, der nichts ahnte, wie viele Wenzel schon an
dieser Stelle gewetzt hatten, ernsthaft entjungfert, wurden geheiratet
und sind, wenn sie auch hie und da einer Versuchung nicht widerstehen
konnten, wie meine Mutter, doch keine Hure geworden wie ich.

Nur die Ereignisse, von denen ich jetzt berichten werde, haben mich zur
Dirne gemacht, nur sie sind Veranlassung gewesen, da√ü ich den Weg ging,
den man den ¬ªWeg des Lasters¬´ nennt. Ich bereue es nicht, diesen Weg
gegangen zu sein. Das habe ich schon gesagt und wiederhole es. Mir tut
h√∂chstens die Ursache leid, aber nicht die Wirkung.

Sonst aber, und auch das mu√ü ich hier, um der Wahrheit die Ehre zu
geben, wiederholt feststellen, sonst aber f√ºhren Tausende und Tausende
von M√§dchen aus den unteren, ja selbst -- wie ich heute wei√ü -- aus den
besten Gesellschaftsschichten in ihrer Kindheit ein so geschlechtliches
Dasein, treiben ahnungslos, verf√ºhrt von ihren Gespielen und
Gespielinnen, alle erdenkliche Unzucht und werden sp√§ter sittsame,
keusche und anst√§ndige M√§dchen, Frauen und M√ºtter, die sich ihrer
Kinderfehler gar nicht erinnern.

Meine Br√ºder waren in die Lehre gekommen. Lorenz, der √§lteste, in
dasselbe Gesch√§ft, in dem mein Vater arbeitete. Franz zu einem
Buchbinder. Ich sah sie nur mehr an Sonntagnachmittagen. Lorenz sprach
fast gar nicht mehr mit mir. Franz erz√§hlte mir, er habe bei seinem
Meister ein junges Dienstm√§dchen vom Land, das sich von ihm v√∂geln lasse
und bei dem er in der Nacht schlafen k√∂nne.

Wir hielten einen stillen alten Mann als Bettgeher, der fr√ºh das Haus
verlie√ü, und sp√§t abends heimkehrte. Ich schlief auf dem Sofa im Zimmer.
Das Bett der Mutter stand leer neben dem meines Vaters.

Einen Tag, nachdem wir beim Kommiss√§r waren, sagte mein Vater zu mir:
¬ªIch wollte dich eigentlich recht fest durchhauen, weil du so ein
Saumensch bist¬†...¬´

Es war das einzige, was ich √ºber den Fall von ihm geh√∂rt hatte. Ich
erschrak und meinte: ¬ªAber ich kann doch nichts daf√ºr¬†...¬´

¬ªNa ja¬´, brummte er, ¬ªist eigentlich wahr¬†..., so ein Schweinkerl¬†...¬´
Nach einer Weile sagte er: ¬ªGeschehen ist geschehen¬†...¬´

Und wieder nach einer Weile: ¬ªJetzt werd' ich aber aufpassen auf dich,
verstehst¬†...? Du gehst mir nirgends hin, ohne Erlaubnis¬†..., und¬†...,
und¬†...¬´, er stockte, dann rief er heftig: ¬ªUnd von heut ab schlafst du
da¬†...¬´ Er deutete auf das Bett der Mutter.

Ich war erstaunt, und er setzte hinzu: ¬ªEs sind immer Bettgeher da¬†...,
man kann nicht wissen¬†..., ich will aufpassen¬†...¬´

So schlief ich von diesem Abend Bett an Bett mit meinem Vater.

Als er vom Wirtshaus nach Hause kam, war es vielleicht schon elf Uhr,
und ich wachte nicht auf.

Erst als er vielemale gefl√ºstert hatte: ¬ªBist du da¬†...? H√∂rst¬†..., bist
du da¬†...?¬´ erwachte ich, und schlaftrunken antwortete ich: ¬ªJa,
Vater¬†...¬´

¬ªWo bist du?¬´

¬ªDa, Vater, da bin ich¬†...¬´, sagte ich vom Schlafe befangen.

Er tastete nach mir: ¬ªAh, ja¬†..., da bist du¬†...¬´

Und er fuhr mir vom Hals zur Brust herunter. Mir gab es einen Schlag,
als er nach meinem Busen griff, ihn in die Hand nahm und abf√ºhlte. Ich
lag ganz still.

¬ªAlsdann¬†..., da¬†...¬´, murmelte er stockend, ¬ªalsdann da hat er dich
angegriffen, der Herr Katechet¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa, Vater¬†...¬´, fl√ºsterte ich.

¬ªDa auch?¬´ Er packte meine andere Brust.

¬ªJa, Vater¬†...¬´

¬ªSo ein Schuft¬´, redete er weiter, ¬ªso ein Hund¬†..., das k√∂nnt' ihm
passen¬†...¬´, aber dabei spielte er mit meiner Brustwarze.

¬ªWie hat er's denn gemacht¬†...?¬´ frug er zu mir her√ºber.

¬ªSo wie der Vater¬†...¬´, sagte ich leise.

Er fuhr mir unters Hemd und fa√üte mich an der Fut, w√ºhlte mit den
Fingern in den Haaren herum und fl√ºsterte: ¬ªPepi¬†...?¬´

Ich war starr vor Schrecken und Erregung.

¬ªJa, Vater¬†...¬´

¬ªPepi¬†..., da ist er auch gewesen¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa, Vater¬†..., da auch¬†...¬´

¬ªMit seiner Nudl, vielleicht gar¬†...?¬´

Ich staunte √ºber diese Frage. Der Vater wu√üte doch alles, hatte er es
vergessen? Oder fragte er mit Absicht?

Er wiederholte: ¬ªSag¬†..., mit seiner Nudl ist er dagewesen¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬†..., Vater¬†...¬´

¬ªDa drinn?¬´ Er versuchte meine Spalte zu √∂ffnen und mir den Finger
hineinzustecken. Ich stie√ü seine Hand fort.

¬ªAber Vater¬†...¬´, sagte ich.

¬ªIch will's wissen¬†...¬´, zischelte er mir zu, und fa√üte mich wieder dort
an.

¬ªAber Vater¬´, bat ich, ¬ªwas tun S' denn Vater¬†...?¬´ Sein Finger sa√ü mir
im Loch. ¬ªVater, Vater¬†..., h√∂ren S' auf¬´, fl√ºsterte ich ihm zu, ¬ªSie
wissen ja¬†..., er ist drinn g'wesen¬†..., ja¬†..., h√∂r'n S' auf¬†...¬´

¬ªHat er dich gev√∂gelt¬†...?¬´ Der Finger bohrte weiter.

¬ªJa¬´, sagte ich schnell, ¬ªer hat mich halt gev√∂gelt¬†..., ich kann ja nix
daf√ºr¬†...¬´

¬ªDas ist dein Gl√ºck¬†...¬´, brummte mein Vater, lie√ü mich los, drehte sich
um und schlief ein.

Ein paar N√§chte lag ich ruhig neben ihm im Bett; er fa√üte mich nicht an,
und ich verga√ü ganz, was vorgefallen war, oder wenn ich daran dachte,
schrieb ich dieses sonderbare Benehmen der Wut zu, die mein Vater wegen
des Katecheten haben mochte.

Am Samstag waren wir im Gasthaus gewesen, und als wir uns niedergelegt
hatten, griff der Vater wieder zu mir her√ºber.

¬ªDu¬´, sagte er, indem er meinen Busen suchte.

¬ªDu¬†...¬´

¬ªJa, Vater¬†...¬´

¬ªDu, wie oft¬†..., wie oft hat dich der Katechet gev√∂gelt¬†..., ha¬†...?¬´

¬ªIch wei√ü nicht mehr, Vater¬†...¬´

¬ªNa, wie oft¬†...?¬´

¬ªWenn ich's aber nicht wei√ü¬†...¬´

¬ªDu! Ich will's wissen.¬´ Er hatte meine Brust erwischt und quetschte
sie, da√ü ich schrie.

¬ªAber, Vater¬†...¬´

¬ªWie oft¬†...?¬´

¬ªVielleicht zehnmal¬†...¬´

¬ªSo? Zehnmal gar¬†...?¬´

Er spielte an meiner Warze, die sich aufrichtete.

¬ªZehnmal¬´, fragte er, ¬ªauf einmal?¬´

Ich mu√üte l√§cheln. ¬ªAber nein¬†..., jedesmal einmal¬†...¬´

¬ªAlso zehnmal¬†...?¬´

Und er fingerte meine Brustwarze, da√ü sie h√∂her und h√∂her wurde. Ich
hatte ein Gef√ºhl von Neugierde, Wohlsein, Geilheit und Scheu, und die
Scheu √ºberwog noch, deshalb nahm ich seine Hand und dr√ºckte sie mehr von
mir fort.

¬ªGehn S', h√∂ren S' auf, Vater, was machen S' denn?¬´

¬ªNix, nix¬†...¬´, brummte er und zog sich zur√ºck.

Wieder war ein paar Tage Ruhe. Ich schlief meistens schon, wenn der
Vater nach Hause kam. Da√ü er etwas anderes von mir wollte, fiel mir
nicht ein. Ich glaubte nur, er k√∂nne sich √ºber den Katecheten nicht
beruhigen.

Da fing er wieder eines Abends an. Wir hatten uns gleichzeitig zu Bett
gelegt, und w√§hrend er nach mir tastete, fragte er: ¬ªWas hast denn
g'macht heut den ganzen Tag?¬´

¬ªNichts, Vater¬†...¬´, antwortete ich.

Er fuhr mir schon in den Hemdausschnitt und ich hielt mir die H√§nde vor
der Brust.

¬ªWarst in der Schul?¬´

¬ªJa.¬´

Er versuchte meine H√§nde zu verdr√§ngen, um meine Br√ºste zu erreichen.

¬ªHast einen neuen Katecheten?¬´

¬ªJa, Vater¬†...¬´

¬ªNa¬†..., tatschelt der dich auch so ab¬†...?¬´ Er hatte meine Brust
erwischt und spielte mit ihr ...

¬ªNein, Vater¬†...¬´

¬ªUnd der Herr Lehrer¬†...?¬´

¬ªWir haben ja eine Lehrerin, Vater¬†...¬´

¬ªSo? Und der Katechet tut nix¬†...?¬´

Ich versuchte es ihn fortzudr√§ngen. ¬ªNein¬†..., nichts tut er¬†...¬´

Er lie√ü meine Brust los und griff mir zwischen die Beine, so schnell,
da√ü ich sie nicht schlie√üen konnte, und so hielt er meine warme Muschel
ganz in der Hand.

¬ªBitt' Sie, Vater¬†..., Vater¬†...¬´, ich atmete schon schwer, denn er
kitzelte meine Geilheit wach, ¬ªbitt' sch√∂n¬†..., Vater¬†..., nicht¬†...¬´

¬ªWei√üt du¬†...¬´, stammelte er¬†..., ¬ªwei√üt du¬†..., wenn vielleicht der
neue Katechet¬†..., so mit dir zum Spielen anfangt¬†...¬´, er lie√ü ein
wahres Trommeln auf meinen Kitzler los, ¬ªoder wenn er gar so was machen
will¬†...¬´, damit probiert er mir den Finger hineinzustecken, ¬ªdann la√ü
dir's nicht gefallen¬†...¬´

¬ªNein, Vater¬†..., nein¬†..., aber gehen S' fort¬†...¬´ Ich schlo√ü die
Beine, machte einen Schneller mit dem Popo, und war frei.

¬ªNa¬†..., na¬´, meinte er, ¬ªist schon recht¬†...¬´

Noch immer ahnte ich nichts. Aber ich hatte nur vor mir selbst Angst.
Diese Ber√ºhrungen regten mich auf. Der Wunsch, gev√∂gelt zu werden, seine
Betastungen zu erwidern, die Begierde nach seinem Schweif zu langen,
durchzuckte und erschreckte mich. Ich meinte, er werde mich halb
totschlagen, wenn ich mich unterstehen w√ºrde, so was merken zu lassen.
Ich glaubte, er wolle mich pr√ºfen.

Aber wieder ein paar N√§chte sp√§ter, wachte ich auf. Ich hatte tief
geschlafen und erwachte unter seinen Ber√ºhrungen. Er lag dicht neben
mir, hatte meine Brust entbl√∂√üt, und spielte mit den Warzen. Er spielte
so leise, so zart, da√ü sie beide hoch und steif emporstanden. Ich
stellte mich schlafend, und eine ungeheure Neugierde erf√ºllte mich, was
er mit mir anfangen werde. Jetzt ahnte ich ja, worauf er hinaus wollte.
Doch ich sch√§mte mich zu sehr, und war au√üerdem nicht ganz sicher, ob
das nicht eine neue Pr√ºfung sei. Ich lag ganz still.

Da fa√üte er meine linke Brust und begann meine Himbeere zu k√ºssen und zu
lecken.

Unwillk√ºrlich fuhr ein Zucken durch meinen K√∂rper. Aber ich atmete tief
und tat so, als ob ich fest schliefe. Er leckte wieder, sog daran,
pre√üte meine beiden Duteln, und wenn mich das Zucken sch√ºttelte, h√∂rte
er auf. Da glaubte ich, er wolle sehen, ob ich wach sei, und stellte
mich erst recht, als ob ich schlafe.

Auf einmal hob er die Decke und streifte mir das Hemd in die H√∂he. Mein
Herz begann vor Angst und Geilheit laut zu pochen, denn noch immer
glaubte ich an eine Art von Pr√ºfung. Es war eine unbestimmte, dumpfe
Vorstellung, die mich neben meiner sinnlichen Erregung beherrschte.

Behutsam, leise schob er, im Bett neben mir sitzend, meine F√º√üe
auseinander. Ich lie√ü es willenlos geschehen. Als er mir aber mit der
Hand √ºber die Spalte strich, mu√üte ich damit zucken, und da h√∂rte er
wieder auf. Ich imitierte, wie von nichts zu wissen, ein leises
Schnarchen.

Da schwang er sich zwischen meine Beine, und in den Armen aufgest√ºtzt,
lag er √ºber mir, ohne mich anders als mit der Schwanzspitze zu ber√ºhren.
Ich konnte mich nicht halten vor Geilheit, und wetzte auf und nieder,
als er mir mit dem hei√üen Schweif leise gegen die Fut stie√ü. Dabei fuhr
ich mit dem Schnarchen fort.

Er hielt seinen Schweif nur au√üen in die √§u√üere Muschel√∂ffnung, rieb ihn
dort leise hin und her und regte mich furchtbar auf. Ich erwartete, ich
hoffte jeden Moment, er werde ihn nun endlich hineinstecken, ich war
halb von Sinnen. Da entlud er sich. Ich wurde in meinen Haaren und auf
meinem Bauch von der warmen Flut √ºbergossen, und gleich darauf zog er
sich von mir zur√ºck, leise, vorsichtig, damit ich nicht erwache.

Jetzt erst wu√üte ich genau, was mein Vater mit mir f√ºr Absichten hatte.
Und ich mu√ü gestehen, so peinlich mir heute der Gedanke daran ist, so
wenig verletzte er mich damals. Ich dachte weder, ob es recht noch ob es
unrecht sei. Es erschien mir angenehm. Ich kam mir erwachsen vor. Ich
hatte so eine dunkle Vorstellung, als brauche ich meinen Vater von nun
ab nicht mehr zu f√ºrchten, ja als sei mir alles erlaubt.

Die folgende Nacht schlief ich nicht, sondern stellte mich nur so.

Richtig. Mein Vater pa√üte auf, ob ich schon eingeschlafen sei. Als ich
tief zu atmen anfing, kam er herbei. Diesmal hob er gleich die Decke und
legte sich neben mich, dann h√ºllte er uns beide ein. Zuerst lag er still
an mich gepre√üt, vielmehr an meinen Schenkel, denn ich lag auf dem
R√ºcken. Und er schob mein Hemd leise hinauf, so da√ü ich an dieser Seite
seinen Stachel sich langsam aufrichten f√ºhlte. Er schob mein Hemd h√∂her
und h√∂her, bis dicht unter meinen Hals hinauf. Dann fing er wieder das
Spiel mit meinen Br√ºsten an und k√º√üte und saugte die Warzen, da√ü mich
das Verlangen nur so sch√ºttelte. Ich bedachte, da√ü er wieder nur von
au√üen anklopfen und ich dabei leer ausgehen w√ºrde. Trotzdem wagte ich es
nicht, meine Schlafpose aufzugeben.

Seine Hand glitt abw√§rts. Wieder schob er mir die Beine auseinander. Es
ward ihm leicht, denn ein wenig hatte ich sie schon unwillk√ºrlich von
selbst gespreizt. Als er mich mit den Fingern ber√ºhrte, hielt ich mich
nicht zur√ºck und begann, mit dem Popo ein wenig zu tanzen. Ich hatte es
ja die Nacht vorher erfahren, da√ü er dennoch glaubte, ich schliefe.

Er wurde durch meine Bewegung so in Aufregung versetzt, da√ü er mich
sofort bestieg, und kaum f√ºhlte ich seinen Hausmeister mit hei√üem Kopf
den Eingang suchen, als ich von meiner Geilheit √ºberw√§ltigt, schwerer zu
sto√üen anhub und mich bem√ºhte, durch geschicktes Entgegenhalten seinen
Einschlupf herbeizuf√ºhren. Hatte ihn die Aufregung unbedenklich gemacht,
oder mochte er glauben, mein Schlaf sei so fest genug, auch er begann
heftiger zu sto√üen, als die Nacht vorher. Ich erwiderte jeden Sto√ü.
Bajonett und Scheide bem√ºhten sich zusammen zu kommen, und auf einmal
stak er bei mir so tief als m√∂glich.

Ohne es zu achten, rief ich: ¬ªAch¬†...¬´

Er lag still und hielt seinen Schweif fest in mich hineingepre√üt.

Aber ich hatte doch jetzt das Bewu√ütsein, da√ü ich mich nicht habe zu
f√ºrchten brauchen, und redete ihn an, als sei ich eben erwacht.

¬ªVater¬†..., was tun Sie denn¬†...?¬´ Dabei machte ich ein paar ganz leise
St√∂√üe.

Er erschrak, vermochte aber nicht mich zu verlassen.

¬ªVater¬†...¬´, fl√ºsterte ich, ¬ªum Gottes willen,¬†..., was machen Sie¬†...,
gehn S' fort¬†..., Vater¬†..., gehen S' fort¬†..., was tun S' denn da?¬´ und
w√§hrend ich das sagte, wurden meine St√∂√üe st√§rker.

¬ªNix tu' ich¬†...¬´, fl√ºsterte er, ¬ªnix¬†..., ich hab'¬†..., ich hab' ...
geschlafen.¬´

¬ªAlso Vater¬†..., was machen wir denn?¬´

¬ªIch hab's nicht gewu√üt, da√ü du's bist¬†...¬´

Ich merkte die Ausrede und erwiderte: ¬ªJa, ich bin's¬†..., ich bin's
Vater¬†..., ich¬†...¬´ Mit jedem ¬ªich bin's¬´ aber mu√üte ich, von seinem
Stiel gereizt, einen heftigen Sto√ü tun.

¬ªVater¬†...¬´, sagte ich weiter, da er schwieg, ¬ªVater¬†..., Sie v√∂geln
mich ja¬†...¬´ Und ich umarmte ihn.

Er lag jetzt ganz auf mir, packte mich bei den Br√ºsten, und ohne mir zu
antworten, begann er regelrecht und ungeniert zu sto√üen.

Ich hielt ihn fest umschlungen und fl√ºsterte ihm ins Ohr:

¬ªDas ist ja eine S√ºnd¬†..., Vater¬†..., ich f√ºrcht' mich¬†..., ach¬†...,
Vater¬†..., ach fester¬†..., fester¬†..., ach ... so ist's gut¬†..., aber
ich f√ºrcht' mich¬†...¬´

¬ªMacht nix¬´, gab er zur√ºck, ¬ªes wei√ü ja niemand was¬†..., und es wird ja
niemand was wissen¬†...¬´

¬ªNein¬†...¬´, stimmte ich bei, ¬ªnein¬†..., ich sag' nix¬†...¬´

Er stie√ü heftiger zu. ¬ªSo ist recht¬†..., brav bist du¬†..., brav¬†...¬´

Ich fragte keck: ¬ªVater¬†..., ist's gut¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬†..., ja¬†..., ja¬†...¬´, und er suchte mit dem Mund meine Brust.

¬ªWann der Vater will¬†...¬´, fl√ºsterte ich, ¬ªlass' ich mich immer von
Ihnen v√∂geln¬†...¬´

¬ªSei ruhig¬†..., ja¬†..., ich will¬†...¬´

¬ªVater, mir kommt's¬†..., fester¬†..., fester¬†..., ach¬†..., so¬†...!¬´

Ich war selig, denn so lang hatte ich darauf gewartet, und jetzt schien
mir alles gestattet zu sein.

¬ªVater, kommt's Ihnen auch¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa, jetzt¬†..., jetzt¬†..., Pepi¬†..., jetzt¬†..., ach das ist gut¬†...¬´

Wir opferten beide zu gleicher Zeit und schliefen Arm in Arm ein.

Am n√§chsten Tag war mein Vater sehr sch√ºchtern wie noch nie. Er sprach
nur in leisem Ton zu mir und mit abgewendetem Antlitz. Ich wich ihm aus
und wartete auf den Abend.

Als wir im Bett lagen, kroch ich zu ihm.

¬ªVater¬†...¬´, fl√ºsterte ich, ¬ªsind Sie b√∂s¬†...?¬´ Ich nahm seine Hand und
legte sie an meine nackte Brust.

¬ªNein¬†...¬´, antwortete er, ¬ªich bin nicht b√∂s¬†...¬´

¬ªWeil S' heut nix mit mir gesprochen haben¬†...¬´

¬ªAch¬†..., ich hab' nur nachgedacht¬†...¬´, meinte er.

¬ªWas denn? Vater¬†...¬´

¬ªNa, ich mein'¬†...¬´ entgegnete er, w√§hrend er meine Br√ºste, die sich
√ºber ihn neigten, streichelte, ¬ªich mein', wenn der sch√§bige Katechet
das hat machen d√ºrfen, dann ist sowieso alles eins¬†...¬´

Ich fuhr unter die Decke, haschte seinen Schweif, der sich sofort
aufrichtete, wie ein Soldat auf den Alarmruf in die H√∂he springt.

¬ªVater¬†..., wenn Sie wieder wollen¬†..., ich lass' mich¬†...¬´

¬ªIn Gottes Namen¬´, keuchte er.

Und da bestieg ich ihn rittlings und pflanzte mir den St√ºtzbalken ein.
Er hielt mich bei den Br√ºsten fest, und so machten wir es in wenigen
Minuten zu Ende.

Jetzt war mein Vater auch bei Tag freundlich zu mir. Wenn ich ihm ein
Glas Wasser reichte oder er sonst an mir vor√ºberging, fa√üte er mich bei
der Brust, und ich w√ºhlte rasch ein bi√üchen an seiner Hose herum.

Er sprach auch vom Gesch√§ft mit mir, von allen m√∂glichen Angelegenheiten
des Haushaltes, von seinen Geldsorgen. Dabei kaufte er mir an Kleidern,
was ich mir nur w√ºnschte und was er konnte, lie√ü mich den Zins vom
Bettgeher einheben, kurz ich kam mir sehr erwachsen und wichtig vor.

Einmal fragte ich ihn: ¬ªErinnern Sie sich, Vater, was ich dem Herrn
Katecheten noch hab' tun m√ºssen?¬´

Es war in der Nacht, und wir hatten gerade eine sch√∂ne Leistung, aber
freilich eine einzige hinter uns.

¬ªNein¬´, sagte er, ¬ªwas denn?¬´

¬ªSoll ich's Ihnen zeigen?¬´

¬ªJa¬†..., da w√§r' ich neugierig¬†...¬´

Ich nahm seinen weich gewordenen Pendel, schob meinen Kopf herunter und
f√ºhrte ihn mir in den Mund. ¬ªIst das gut¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬†..., gut ist das¬†..., ach¬†..., mach's nur weiter¬†..., nur
weiter¬†...¬´

Ich arbeitete mit meiner ganzen Routine, bis er den Flaggenmast wieder
aufrichtete. Dann lie√ü ich los.

¬ªVater¬†..., der Katechet hat's mir aber auch so gemacht¬†...¬´, log ich.
Mir war's ja egal. Katechet oder nicht, den Kooperator durfte ich ja
wohl verschweigen.

¬ªWillst du's von mir auch haben¬†...?¬´ fragte er mich.

¬ªJa¬†...¬´

Er fa√üte mich um die Mitte, warf mich in mein Bett her√ºber und war
sogleich mit dem Kopf zwischen meinen Beinen. Und nun begann er meine
Diele zu scheuern, da√ü mir der Atem verging.

Im n√§chsten Moment aber unterbrach er sich und begann mich zu v√∂geln.
Mir war das eine, wie das andere recht, weshalb ich mit meiner
Begeisterung nicht zur√ºckhielt.

In dieser Zeit wechselten unsere Bettgeher, und der jetzt kam, war ein
Kaffeehauskellner. Er servierte in einem jener kleinen anr√ºchigen
Lokale, die man Tschecherl nennt. Um drei Uhr fr√ºh kam er nach Hause,
schlief bis um zw√∂lf Uhr Mittag und ging von uns wieder an seine Arbeit.

Es war ein ausgemergelter Kerl mit einem gelben Gesicht, tiefliegenden
schwarzen Augen und mit der gro√üen ¬ªSechser¬´-Frisur, wie sie damals als
nobel galt. Obwohl er vielleicht schon sechsunddrei√üig Jahre z√§hlte,
hatte er doch nur vier bis sechs k√ºmmerliche Lippenh√§rchen, die den
Schnurrbart vorstellten.

Mir war er h√∂chst unsympathisch, und als er mir in den ersten Tagen
gleich an die Br√ºste griff, schlug ich ihm auf die Hand und stie√ü ihn
vor die Brust.

Er sah mich scheel an und lie√ü von mir ab.

Doch ein paar Tage sp√§ter fa√üte er mich, w√§hrend ich in der K√ºche zu tun
hatte, pl√∂tzlich von r√ºckw√§rts, hielt mich an sich gepre√üt und
bearbeitete meine Br√ºste, da√ü ich f√ºrchtete, die Warzen werden mir
aufstehen.

W√ºtend schlug ich um mich, stie√ü nach hinten mit den F√º√üen aus, und er
mu√üte mich freigeben. Aber er sagte b√∂s: ¬ªNa, na¬†..., darf man das
Fr√§ulein nur anr√ºhren, wenn man ein Katechet ist¬†...?¬´

Ich war sprachlos vor Staunen. Trotzdem fa√üte ich mich und schrie ihn
an:

¬ªHalten S' das Maul¬†...¬´

¬ªSch√∂n¬†..., sch√∂n¬†...¬´, sagte er, ¬ªSie lassen Ihnen nur von einem
geistlichen Herrn v√∂geln¬†...¬´

Er mu√üte von den Hausleuten alles erfahren haben. Aber ich war ihm
gewachsen.

¬ªWenn Sie nicht Ruh geben¬†...¬´, sagte ich streng, ¬ªnachher zeig' ich
Ihnen bei der Polizei an¬†...¬´

Er wurde noch gelber und schwieg. W√§hrend er sich vollends anzog, hieb
und stie√ü er w√ºtend mit seinen Sachen herum. Dann setzte er zornig
seinen Hut auf, kam dicht an mich heran und fl√ºsterte: ¬ªNa warten
S'¬†..., mit der Polizei drohen Sie mir¬†..., Sie Mensch, Sie
ausgeficktes¬†..., warten S'¬†..., Sie werden mich noch einmal bitten, da√ü
ich Ihnen die Ehr erweis'¬†...¬´ Ich lachte h√∂hnisch auf, und er ging
fort.

Aber er war es, der zuletzt lachte.

Es war ein paar Wochen sp√§ter. Ich wusch mich und stand im Hemd und
Unterrock. Der Vater, der weg ging, nahm Abschied von mir und steckte
seine Hand in mein Hemd, um ein bi√üchen mit meiner Brust zu spielen.

In diesem Augenblick √∂ffnete der Rudolf -- so hie√ü der Kaffeehauskellner
-- rasch die T√ºr. Noch nie war er so zeitlich wach gewesen. Mein Vater
zog blitzschnell die Hand von mir zur√ºck.

Rudolf sagte gelassen: ¬ªEntschuldigen, k√∂nnt' ich heut das Fr√ºhst√ºck
fr√ºher haben? Ich mu√ü zum Magistrat¬†...¬´

Wir glaubten, er habe nichts bemerkt.

Als aber der Vater fort war und ich in die K√ºche ging, um Kaffee f√ºr
Rudolf zu kochen, grinste mich der Bursche an und lachte: ¬ªAlso der
Vater darf mit die Duteln spielen, was?¬´

¬ªSie l√ºgen ja¬†...¬´, antwortete ich, rot im Gesicht.

¬ªIch hab' aber gut gesehen¬†...¬´, beharrte er.

¬ªNichts haben Sie g'sehen¬†...¬´, schrie ich, ¬ªder Vater hat mir nur
gesagt, ich soll mich besser waschen.¬´

Er lachte laut, trat an das Wasserschaff, zog ruhig vor mir seinen
Schweif heraus, und wusch sich ihn ab. W√§hrend ich ins Zimmer lief, rief
er mir nach: ¬ªIch mu√ü mich auch besser waschen¬†...¬´

Dann kam er herein und sagte: ¬ªJawohl, ich mu√ü mich besser waschen, denn
heut oder morgen wird mich die Fr√§ul'n Pepi bitten, da√ü ich sie
petschieren soll¬†...¬´

Diesmal war ich es, die schwieg.

Wochen verstrichen. Er schaute mich nicht an, ich schaute ihn nicht an.
Der Vater und ich vergn√ºgten uns, wenn auch nicht gerade jede Nacht, so
doch oft, und wir hatten alle K√ºnste, die mir schon vorher so gel√§ufig
waren, durchgemacht.

Da√ü ich mit meinem Vater so lebte, machte den Eindruck auf mich, da√ü ich
mich von den anderen, besonders aber von den Buben fern hielt. Nur
zweimal war ich in der Zwischenzeit beim Herrn Kooperator gewesen, und
nur, um wieder von ihm absolviert zu werden.

Das erste Mal fand ich ein kleines M√§dchen von sieben Jahren bei ihm. Er
hatte sie nackt ausgezogen, und sie lachte mir vom Bett her schon
entgegen. Der Kooperator schleckte sie, was ihr sehr gut gefiel. Sie
hatte, wie sie mir dann erz√§hlte, sonst mit ihrem Onkel und dann mit dem
Fleischhauer in unserer Gasse Unzucht getrieben, ohne zu v√∂geln. Der
Kooperator v√∂gelte sie also auch nicht. Aus Vorsicht, wie ich glaube,
sondern er ¬ªreinigte¬´ sie nur, und ich kam ihm eben recht, seinen
erregten kleinen Laienbruder in meiner Einzelzelle zu bes√§nftigen. Ich
mu√üte mit aufs Bett und w√§hrend der Kooperator purifizierte, ents√ºndigte
er mich mit kolossalen St√∂√üen. Dann entlie√ü er uns beide und blieb
schnaufend zur√ºck.

Das zweite Mal war ich allein mit ihm, und konnte ihm von meinem Vater
beichten.

Er schlug die H√§nde zusammen: ¬ªDa bist du verloren¬†...¬´

Ich glaubte ihm jetzt nicht mehr, sondern spielte einfach die Kom√∂die
mit, und meinte nur, er solle die Absolution teurer verkaufen.

¬ªIch werde flei√üig Bu√üe tun, Hochw√ºrden¬´, versprach ich.

¬ªWie denn Bu√üe¬†...?¬´ rief er.

Da kniete ich nieder, holte seinen Weihwedel heraus und fing an ihn so
zu lecken, da√ü er ihm wie ein Dampfkessel zu brodeln begann.

Ich stie√ü mir seinen Zapfen bis an mein Zapferl in den Rachen.

Er langte hinunter und rief mich: ¬ªKomm.¬´

Da drehte ich mich um, lie√ü ihm den Popo und zwischen meinen Beinen nach
r√ºckw√§rts greifend, schob ich mir seinen Kolben hinein, wetzte so
eifrig, da√ü es im Augenblick danach kein Halten mehr gab, und seine
Wasser sprangen.

Ich lie√ü ihn aber nicht zur Ruhe kommen, sondern z√ºngelte ihn wieder
auf, und wiederholte die Bu√üe ein zweites Mal, und wir schieden zuletzt
vers√∂hnt. Nur mu√üte ich geloben, mich von meinem Vater fernzuhalten. Ich
tat es ruhig, weil ich wu√üte, ich k√∂nne mir auch f√ºr meine
R√ºckf√§lligkeit Verzeihung erlangen.

Mein Vater hatte, nachdem die erste st√ºrmische Zeit vor√ºber war, die
Gewohnheit angenommen, mich regelm√§√üig am Sonntag fr√ºh vor dem Aufstehen
zu v√∂geln. Das ist, wie ich heute wei√ü, bei allen Arbeitern der Fall,
die w√§hrend der Woche m√ºde sind, zeitlich auf m√ºssen und deshalb
meistens am Sonntag, wenn sie ausgeschlafen sind, ihre Frauen besteigen.
So war es jetzt auch bei uns Brauch geworden, und w√§hrend der Woche
bekam ich den gew√ºnschten Strudel nur hie und da einmal auch in der
Nacht, und auch da nur dann, wenn ich mir ihn selbst holte.

Des Morgens aber war der Vater doch immer am meisten aufgelegt, mich
abzut√§tscheln, und ehe er das Haus verlie√ü, noch ein wenig mit mir zu
spielen. Dazu reizte ihn wohl der Umstand, da√ü ich, w√§hrend er sich
anzog und wusch und fr√ºhst√ºckte, meist im Hemd herumging oder doch nur
im Unterrock und Hemd.

Eines Morgens nun, es war, glaube ich an einem Donnerstag, und wir
hatten seit dem Sonntagmorgen nichts mit einander gehabt, griff mir der
Vater jedesmal an die Br√ºste, so da√ü ich ganz aufgeregt wurde. Ich hielt
sie ihm also auch noch extra hin, und er wurde immer geiler. Endlich,
als er sich gewaschen hatte, und ich gerade das Bettzeug l√ºften wollte,
erwischte er mich, wie ich an ihm vorbei mu√üte, fuhr mir ins Hemd und
traktierte meine Himbeeren, die sich aufstellten. Ich h√§tte es in diesem
Moment gar zu gern getan, und wie er so in den Unterhosen vor mir stand,
griff ich zu und fa√üte seinen stehenden Fechter beim Kopf. So rieben wir
uns beide ein paar Sekunden dort, wo es uns am wohlsten tat, bis mein
Vater mich unbedachter Weise aufs Bett warf, und ich ebenfalls
unbedachter Weise mir eine schnelle Fr√ºhst√ºcksnummer erhoffte. Er hatte
mir eben die R√∂cke aufgehoben und sich auf mich geworfen, als Rudolf die
T√ºre √∂ffnete.

¬ªO Pardon!¬´ sagte er und fuhr zur√ºck.

Wir stoben entsetzt auseinander. Der Vater ging sofort hinaus, und ich
h√∂rte ihn nach einer Weile sagen: ¬ªDas M√§del mu√ü man mit Gewalt aus dem
Bett ziehen, sie will sonst nicht aufstehen¬†...¬´

Rudolf lachte.

Als der Vater hereinkam, sagte er beschwichtigend zu mir: ¬ªEr hat gar
nix gesehen.¬´

Ich erwiderte nichts, aber ich war nur zu sehr vom Gegenteil √ºberzeugt.
Der Vater hatte denn auch kaum das Haus verlassen, als Rudolf
hereinst√ºrzte.

¬ªNa¬´, fuhr er mich an, ¬ªhat der Vater vielleicht heut auch nur haben
wollen, da√ü du dich besser waschen sollst¬†...?¬´

Da ich noch im Hemd war, hielt ich mir ein Handtuch vor die Brust. Er
ri√ü es mir weg.

¬ªMach keine G'schichten¬†...¬´, lachte er, und ich bemerkte erst jetzt,
da√ü er mich duzte.

¬ªHab' ich mit Ihnen Bruderschaft getrunken?¬´ fuhr ich ihn an.

¬ªGeniern werd' ich mich vor so einem ausgefickten Luder, die mit dem
eigenen Vater v√∂gelt.¬´

¬ªWir haben nicht gev√∂gelt¬†...¬´, widersprach ich der Wahrheit gem√§√ü.

¬ªHalt's Maul¬´, schrie er mich an, ¬ªwillst mir vielleicht abstreiten, was
ich selbst gesehen hab'¬†...¬´

¬ªNix haben S' g'sehen¬†...¬´

¬ªSo? Ist er vielleicht nicht auf dir gelegen, wie ich hereingekommen
bin, und hast nicht den Kittel in der H√∂h' gehabt¬†...?¬´

¬ªNein¬´, sagte ich, aber schon sehr unsicher.

¬ªSoo¬†...? Nein!¬´ Er kam n√§her. ¬ªDann werd' ich dir sagen was ich gesehen
hab: Ich hab' vorhin von drau√üen gesehen, wie er dir alleweil ins Hemd
hineingegriffen hat, na? Und wei√üt, was ich noch gesehen hab'?¬´

Ich schaute ihn angstvoll an.

¬ªIch hab' gesehen¬´, fuhr er in scharfem Ton fort, ¬ªwie du ihm den
Schwanz aus der Hose gezogen hast¬†..., und dann hat er dich aufs Bett
hergeschmissen¬†...¬´

Ich war zerschmettert.

¬ªNa¬†...¬´, lachte er, und fa√üte mich unterm Kinn, so da√ü ich die Augen zu
ihm erheben mu√üte, ¬ªist das vielleicht nicht wahr¬†...?¬´

Ich senkte den Blick vor ihm und schwieg.

¬ªSo¬´, sagte er entschieden, ¬ªund weil die Fr√§ulein Pepi so frech und
keck zu mir gewesen ist, geh' ich jetzt stante pede auf die Polizei und
zeig' die ganze G'schicht an.¬´

Darauf war ich nicht gefa√üt gewesen. Eine entsetzliche Angst ergriff
mich.

Er weidete sich daran und qu√§lte mich noch mehr: ¬ªAlle zwei werdet ihr
eingesperrt ... du und dein Herr Papa¬†...¬´

¬ªNein!¬´ stie√ü ich hervor.

¬ªNein?¬´ wiederholte er. ¬ªNein? Na, das werden wir ja gleich sehen¬†...,
ich kann ja beeiden, was ich gesehen hab'.¬´

Damit wollte er zur T√ºr: ¬ªGleich geh' ich¬†...¬´

Ich warf mich zwischen ihn und die T√ºr.

¬ªBitte¬†...¬´, stammelte ich.

¬ªDa gibt's nichts zu bitten mehr¬†...¬´ Er wollte die T√ºrschnalle
ergreifen.

Ich hielt fest die Arme vor die T√ºr gebreitet: ¬ªBitte¬†...¬´

¬ªBitte¬†..., was?¬´ wiederholte er h√∂hnisch.

Ich fl√ºsterte: ¬ªBitte¬†..., verzeihen Sie mir Herr Rudolf¬†..., da√ü ich
keck zu Ihnen war¬†...¬´

¬ªAha¬†...¬´, frohlockte er, ¬ªjetzt auf einmal¬†..., was?¬´

Ich wurde dringender: ¬ªGehn S' nicht auf die Polizei, Herr Rudolf¬†...,
bitte.¬´

¬ªAh ja¬´, drohte er¬†..., ¬ªich geh' schon auf die Polizei, das gibt's
nicht¬†...¬´

Ich brach in Tr√§nen aus: ¬ªBitte, gehn S' nicht, Herr Rudolf¬†..., ich
kann nichts daf√ºr¬†...¬´

¬ªF√ºr was kannst du nix¬†...?¬´

¬ªDaf√ºr¬†..., da√ü mich der Vater¬†...¬´

¬ªSo?¬´ sagte er und neigte sich dicht zu mir: ¬ªUnd daf√ºr kennst du mich
nicht, da√ü du mich so weggesto√üen hast, wie ich dich hab' ein bisserl
da angreifen wollen¬†...?¬´ Er ber√ºhrte leicht meine Brust.

¬ªIch werd's nimmer tun¬†...¬´, weinte ich.

¬ªAlsdann jetzt la√üt du mich mit die Duterln spielen¬†..., was?¬´

¬ªJa¬†..., Herr Rudolf¬†...¬´

Er ri√ü mir das Hemd ab und nahm meine Br√ºste in die Hand und spielte mit
den Zeigefingern an den Warzen.

¬ªDas darf ich jetzt machen¬†..., was?¬´ spottete er.

¬ªJa¬†..., ja¬´, sagte ich und lie√ü es geschehen.

Er rieb sich stehend mit dem Hosenlatz an meiner Fut: ¬ªUnd das da¬†...¬´,
meinte er lauernd, ¬ªdas d√ºrfte ich jetzt auch¬†..., was?¬´

¬ªJa, Herr Rudolf.¬´ Ich war willenlos.

¬ªSo¬†...?¬´ grinste er, ¬ªjetzt m√∂chst du dich von mir v√∂geln lassen¬†...?¬´

Mir war es die einzige Rettung: ¬ªJa, Herr Rudolf.¬´

¬ªUnd ich mag dich gar nicht v√∂geln¬´, rief er lachend, ¬ªich mag nur auf
die Polizei gehen¬†...¬´

Ich weinte laut. Da fuhr er fort: ¬ªAu√üer du tust mich sch√∂n bitten, ich
soll dich pudern¬†..., ha?¬´

¬ªIch bitt' sch√∂n, Herr Rudolf.¬´

¬ªWart.¬´ Er spielte schneller mit meiner Brust.

¬ªIch bitte¬†...¬´, wiederholte ich.

¬ªSag's doch¬†...¬´, rief er und stie√ü unten gegen mich.

¬ªIch bitte¬†..., Herr Rudolf¬†..., pudern Sie mich¬†...¬´, sagte ich
gehorsam.

¬ªAlso komm.¬´ Er lie√ü von mir ab und ging zum Bett.

Ich folgte ihm ohne Willen.

¬ªLeg dich nieder¬´, befahl er.

Ich tat es.

¬ªHeb deine Kleider auf!¬´

Ich gehorchte.

Er betrachtete mich, wie ich dalag.

Dann kommandierte er weiter: ¬ªMach mir das Hosent√ºrl auf.¬´

Auch das tat ich. Sein Schwanz sprang heraus. Es war eine d√ºnne wei√üe
Nudel, die schief in die H√∂he stand.

Jetzt stieg er ins Bett, legte sich auf mich und sagte: ¬ªSo, und
hineinstecken mu√üt du dir ihn auch selber.¬´

Ich ergriff seinen Schwanz und f√ºhrte ihn mir hinein. Von der
Annehmlichkeit, die ich unwillk√ºrlich empfand, und von der Angst vor der
Polizei endlich befreit, atmete ich auf. Rudolf stak beinahe bis zum
Heft in der Scheide, aber er lag ruhig. ¬ªJetzt mu√üt du noch sagen, bitte
Herr Rudolf, sto√üen Sie¬†...¬´

¬ªBitte Herr Rudolf, sto√üen Sie¬†...¬´, das sagte ich gern.

Meine Brust war nackt. Er ergriff sie und spielte damit und stie√ü unten
seinen Wurm hin und her. Ich verabscheute ihn, ich ha√üte ihn, aber ich
konnte mir nicht helfen, ich wurde geil. Denn er v√∂gelte, indem er den
Keil bei jedem Sto√ü ganz herauszog, um ihn dann sacht wieder ganz hinein
zu bohren.

Nach dem zehnten oder zw√∂lften Dolchsto√ü lie√ü ich meinen Popo springen
und begriff nicht mehr, warum ich mich gegen dieses Abenteuer so
gestr√§ubt hatte.

¬ªAh¬†..., ah¬†...¬´, rief er, ¬ªjetzt werd' ich die Peperl √∂fter v√∂geln,
was?¬´

Und ich: ¬ªFester¬†..., schneller¬†..., mir kommt's¬†..., ach¬†..., ja¬†...,
√∂fter v√∂geln?¬´

¬ªSo ist's recht¬†...¬´, meinte er, ¬ªso werden wir uns vertragen¬†...¬´

¬ªAch¬´, zischelte ich, ¬ª...¬†mir kommt's¬†..., spritzen Sie, Herr Rudolf.¬´

¬ªLangsam¬†...¬´, erwiderte er, ¬ª...¬†ich habe Zeit.¬´

Er blieb immer im selben Tempo.

Pl√∂tzlich fragte er, ohne sich zu unterbrechen: ¬ªV√∂gelst du oft mit dem
Vater¬†...?¬´

Ich leugnete: ¬ªNie¬†..., heut hat er das erste Mal wollen¬†...¬´

Er bohrte mir eben wieder den Schweif hinein: ¬ªL√ºg nicht¬´, zischte er
dabei.

¬ªAch¬†..., mir kommt's schon wieder¬†...¬´, rief ich.

¬ªSag die Wahrheit¬´, befahl er mir.

¬ªJa¬†..., ja¬†...¬´, antwortete ich.

¬ªAlsdann v√∂gelst du oft mit dem Vater¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬†..., oft ... mir kommt's¬†..., fester¬†...¬´

¬ªWann denn immer¬†...?¬´

¬ªMeistens in der Nacht¬†...¬´

¬ªSeit wann?¬´

¬ªSchon ein halbes Jahr¬†...¬´

¬ªAlle Nacht?¬´

¬ªNein¬†...¬´

¬ªFickt er gut¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬†...¬´

¬ªBesser wie ich¬†...?¬´

¬ªNein¬†..., nein¬†...¬´, versicherte ich schmeichelnd, ¬ª...¬†mir kommt's
schon wieder.¬´

¬ªNimmst du ihn auch in den Mund?¬´ inquirierte er weiter.

¬ªJa¬†...¬´

¬ªAuch den meinigen¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬†...¬´, versprach ich.

¬ªUnd schleckt er dir die Fut aus¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬†...¬´

¬ªIst das gut¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬†...¬´

¬ªSoll ich's auch tun¬†...¬´

¬ªJa¬†...¬´

Vielleicht eine halbe Stunde lang bearbeitete er mich, und ich schwamm
in meinem eigenen Saft und in Seligkeit. Endlich keuchte er: ¬ªIch
spritz'! Ich spritz'! Jetzt! Jetzt!¬´

Und damit gab er mir eine solche Ladung, da√ü es h√∂rbar zu gurgeln
anfing, so rann mir das Fruchtwasser aus dem Leib.

Wie wir fertig waren, spielte er noch ein bi√üchen mit meinen Br√ºsten und
plauschte mit mir.

¬ªIch hab' es gleich gewu√üt, da√ü ich dich v√∂geln werde¬†...¬´

¬ªWarum?¬´ fragte ich ihn.

¬ªWeil ich gleich gewu√üt hab', was los ist, wie ich die G'schicht vom
Katecheten geh√∂rt hab', und wie ich gesehen hab', da√ü du neben dein'
Vater schlafst¬†...¬´

¬ªIch kann nix daf√ºr¬´, verteidigte ich mich, ¬ªder Vater hat's g'sagt¬†...¬´

¬ªDas glaub' ich¬´, lachte er.

¬ªWerden Sie's niemandem sagen?¬´ wollte ich wissen.

¬ªWoher denn. Wenn du dich von mir immer v√∂geln la√üt¬†...¬´

¬ªJa¬†..., ich lass' mich immer v√∂geln¬†...¬´, gelobte ich.

¬ªUnd dann¬†..., ich wei√ü es ja schon l√§nger¬´, ... l√§chelte er.

¬ªWas denn¬†...?¬´

¬ªNa, das mit dem Vater¬†...¬´

¬ªWoher denn?¬´

¬ªWeil ich schon paarmal zug'schaut hab'¬†...¬´

Ich erschrak noch nachtr√§glich. ¬ªWann, wann haben Sie zug'schaut¬†...¬´

¬ªEin paarmal¬†..., am Sonntag in der Fr√ºh¬†...¬´

¬ªSo¬†...!¬´

¬ªSoll ich dir's beweisen? Vorigen Sonntag bist du oben g'legen und er
unten, und dann hast du's noch in den Mund genommen, und beim zweitenmal
bist du unten gelegen¬†..., was?¬´

¬ªJa¬†...¬´ ich erinnerte mich. Es war im ersten D√§mmerlicht gewesen.

Er stand auf: ¬ªNa, alsdann bist von heut ab meine Geliebte ... Jetzt
hab' ich halt zwei¬†...¬´

Ich wurde neugierig: ¬ªZwei¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬†...¬´

¬ªWer ist denn die andere¬†...?¬´

¬ªDu wirst sie schon noch sehen¬†...¬´

Damit ging er fort.

Alle Tage des Morgens, wenn mein Vater weggegangen war, kam er herein
und fragte: ¬ªNa, war heute nacht was los¬†...?¬´

Und ich mu√üte ihm erz√§hlen, ob ich gev√∂gelt hatte oder nicht. Er wollte
auch wissen, ob ich noch mit anderen M√§nnern verkehre. Aber das
verschwieg ich ihm wohlweislich und sagte von meinem Kooperator kein
Wort. Er gebrauchte mich keineswegs alle Tage, manchmal spielte er nur
so mit meinen Br√ºsten oder fingerte unten ein wenig herum, und manchmal
sagte er geradaus: ¬ªHeut is nix, ... ich hab' gestern meine andere
Geliebte gefickt¬†...¬´

Ich fand noch immer keinen Gefallen an ihm, wenn er nicht gerade drin
bei mir war, aber ich ha√üte ihn auch nicht mehr, sondern hielt ihn f√ºr
ausnehmend gescheit, weshalb ich eine gro√üe Achtung vor ihm empfand.

Zum Kooperator ging ich alle vierzehn Tage etwa. Aber es war jetzt nicht
mehr die Rede von Reue, von Bu√üe oder Beichte oder vom Reinigen. Er
hatte mich eines Tages gleich als ich ins Zimmer trat, ohne weiteres
entkleidet, mich geschleckt und gev√∂gelt, sich wieder schlecken lassen
und mich dann ein zweites Mal nummeriert und nur lauter Schweinereien
gesprochen. Seit damals verkehrte ich mit ihm wie mit den andern
M√§nnern, und wenn er auf mir lag oder ich auf ihm, sagte ich sogar du zu
ihm.

Rudolf behandelte mich andauernd gut, mein Vater auch, und an mehr
dachte ich nicht.

Wenn mich mein Vater jetzt in der Fr√ºhe beim Ankleiden an den Br√ºsten
nahm oder mir seinen Schweif zum Spielen gab, legte ich mir keine Scheu
mehr auf, weil ich nun wu√üte, da√ü Rudolf nicht mehr auf der Lauer lag,
sondern schlief. Ein paarmal sagte ich sogar scherzweise zu ihm: ¬ªHeut
h√§tten S' uns wieder erwischen k√∂nnen, den Vater und mich¬†...¬´

Er erkundigte sich: ¬ªHabt's gev√∂gelt¬†...?¬´

¬ªNein¬†..., aber ... gespielt ... hat er wieder mit mir.¬´

Rudolf meinte g√ºtig: ¬ªLa√ü ihn nur spielen¬†..., ich schau nicht mehr¬†...¬´
Das sagte er mir so oft, auch von selbst, bis ich daran glaubte und ein
paarmal, wenn der Vater w√§hrend dieser Morgenunterhaltungen innehaltend
meinte: ¬ªPst¬†..., am End kommt der Rudolf¬†...¬´, war ich selbst es
gewesen, die ihn mit den Worten beruhigte: ¬ªAch was¬†..., der
schlaft¬†...¬´

So scherzte er auch eines Morgens mit mir und hatte mir das Hemd
herabgezogen, so da√ü meine Brust frei war. Er k√º√üte sie und begann das
Spiel an den Saugwarzen, was mich ja immer, bis auf den heutigen Tag,
mit sofortigem Begehren erf√ºllt.

Da auch er noch im Hemd war, und nicht einmal eine Unterhose anhatte,
war mir sein ganzes Wehrgeh√§nge rasch zur Hand, und ich bearbeitete
seinen Streichriemen, bis er sich ganz straff anspannte und zu pulsieren
begann.

Da fuhr er mir unter die R√∂cke und dr√§ngte mich gegen das Bett. Mir fiel
doch noch der Rudolf ein, und ich wehrte mich: ¬ªNicht¬†..., der k√∂nnt
doch was h√∂ren¬†...¬´

¬ªA was, der schlaft ja¬´, wiederholte der Vater meine sonst st√§ndige Rede
und f√ºgte hinzu: ¬ªMir kommt's sowieso gleich.¬´

Ich rieb seinen Schaft noch geschwinder und schlug ihm vor: ¬ªLassen Sie
sich's so kommen.¬´ Denn mich hinzulegen, traute ich mich doch nicht.

¬ªDann hast du aber nix¬´, meinte er gutm√ºtig.

¬ªIch brauch' nix¬´, erwiderte ich und setzte bei mir den Vorsatz hinzu,
mich dann von Rudolf schadlos halten zu lassen.

Aber es half nichts.

¬ªNein, nein¬†..., komm nur¬†...¬´, dr√§ngte er.

Und da ich ohnehin schon halb bereit war, es zu tun, lie√ü ich mich aufs
Bett werfen und steckte noch, damit die Sache nur ja geschwinder ginge,
den Kolben eigenh√§ndig in die Maschine.

¬ªAh¬†..., ah¬†...¬´, der Vater begann zu sto√üen.

¬ªAh¬†..., fester¬†..., fester¬†...¬´, erwiderte ich ihm.

¬ªAch¬†..., grad heut ist's so gut¬†...¬´, keuchte er.

¬ªMir kommt's schon ... jetzt¬´, gestand ich.

¬ªNoch ein paar St√∂√üe¬†..., so¬†..., ich spritz' ... jetzt spritz' ich¬†...¬´

In diesem Augenblick schlug auch schon seine Samenwelle gegen mich an,
aber in diesem Augenblick √∂ffnete sich die T√ºre, Rudolf erschien und
fragte gelassen: ¬ªWas machen S' denn da, Herr Nachbar.¬´

Mein Vater war so √ºberrascht, da√ü er rasch drei, vier St√∂√üe tat, um sich
m√∂glichst vollst√§ndig zu entleeren.

¬ªLassen S' Ihnen nicht st√∂ren¬†...¬´, h√∂hnte Rudolf.

Jetzt fuhr mein Vater in die H√∂he und stand mit fliegendem Atem bleich
vor Rudolf.

Rudolf fixierte ihn.

Ich blieb auf dem Bett liegen wie ich war, denn ich wu√üte nicht, was ich
tun sollte.

¬ªDecken wir erst das M√§del zu¬´, h√∂hnte Rudolf, und zog mir die R√∂cke
herab. Dann sah er meine nackte Brust, warf einen Polster drauf und
sagte: ¬ªHalten S' Ihnen das vor, mich regen die Duteln auf.¬´

Der Vater hatte noch kein Wort herausgebracht.

Rudolf wandte sich zu ihm: ¬ªNa, Herr Nachbar¬†..., was haben S' denn mit
dem M√§del da getan?¬´

Mein Vater stammelte: ¬ªHerr Rudolf¬†..., Sie werden mich doch nicht
ungl√ºcklich machen wollen¬†...¬´

Rudolf lachte: ¬ªAber warum denn? Das geht doch keinen Menschen was an,
wenn Sie Ihre Tochter petschieren. Sie haben ja das Madel gemacht¬†...¬´

¬ªHerr Rudolf¬´, stotterte mein Vater, ¬ªich bin Witwer¬†..., ich bin noch
nicht so alt ... Geld hab' ich keins ... Ich kann's doch nicht beim Arm
herausschwitzen¬†...¬´

¬ªAber¬†..., aber¬†..., ist schon recht¬†..., ist schon recht¬†...¬´

¬ªHerr Rudolf¬´, flehte mein Vater, ¬ªSie m√ºssen mir einen heiligen Eid
schw√∂ren, da√ü Sie nix verraten¬†...¬´

¬ªF√§llt mir nicht ein¬´, rief Rudolf obenhin, ¬ªich schw√∂re nicht¬†...,
f√§llt mir nicht ein¬†..., aber ziagn's Ihnen nur an, und kommen S' in die
K√ºche hinaus, da reden wir dann ein Wort miteinander¬†...¬´

Voll Aufregung zog sich mein Vater an. Als er in die K√ºche hinauskam,
war Rudolf schon weg.

Jetzt waren wir beide best√ºrzt. Der Vater ging in die Arbeit, ich trieb
mich umher wie sonst, und mit Beklommenheit legten wir uns abends
schlafen, ohne miteinander zu sprechen. Doch wu√üten wir, was uns
bedr√ºckte.

Der Vater sagte nur einmal: ¬ªWenn er mich anzeigt¬†..., der Kerl¬†...,
nachher erschlag' ich ihn.¬´

Aber ich gelobte mir f√ºr diesen Fall auch meinerseits den Herrn Rudolf
in die Tinte zu legen.

Wir schliefen ein, wachten wieder auf, schliefen wieder eine Weile. Wir
warteten beide auf Rudolf und hofften, er werde, wenn er heimkommt, mit
sich reden lassen.

Endlich h√∂rten wir die T√ºre aufgehen.

¬ªJetzt ist er da¬†...¬´, sagte der Vater. Er nahm ohne weiters an, da√ü ich
wach sei, und ich war es auch. Es mochte drei Uhr sein. Drau√üen zog sich
Rudolf aus, und wir h√∂rten ihn hantieren.

¬ªSoll ich jetzt zu ihm hinausgehen?¬´ fragte der Vater.

¬ªProbieren Sie's¬´, riet ich ihm.

Ehe er aber noch aus dem Bett steigen konnte, √∂ffnete sich die T√ºre. Wir
h√∂rten es, obwohl wir nichts sahen, denn es war stockfinster.

Von der T√ºre her rief Rudolf leise ins Zimmer: ¬ªSchlafen S' Herr
Nachbar?¬´

¬ªNein, nein¬´, sagte mein Vater lebhaft, ¬ªhab' die Ehre Herr Rudolf¬†...¬´

Ohne den Gru√ü zu erwidern rief Rudolf im selben Ton: ¬ªGehn S', lassen S'
die Peperl zu mir herauskommen¬†...¬´

¬ªWas wollen S'¬†...?¬´ Mein Vater setzte sich im Bett auf.

Rudolf wiederholte gleichm√ºtig: ¬ªLassen S' die Peperl zu mir
herauskommen¬´, und er f√ºgte hinzu: ¬ªSie haben doch nichts dagegen, Herr
Nachbar¬†...?¬´ In diesem Nachsatz lag eine Drohung.

Mein Vater verstand sie wohl und sagte nichts.

Rudolf wartete in der T√ºr.

Endlich fl√ºsterte mir der Vater im scheuen Ton zu: ¬ªSo geh halt zu
ihm¬†..., da kann man nix machen¬†..., geh Peperl¬†...¬´ Es klang bedr√ºckt
und traurig.

Ich sprang aus dem Bett, lief zur T√ºr, Rudolf empfing mich, zog mich in
die K√ºche und schlo√ü die T√ºr.

¬ªKomm ins Bett¬†...¬´, sagte er zu mir.

Wir legten uns nieder.

¬ªSo¬´, er kicherte vergn√ºgt, und schmiegte sich an mich, ¬ªjetzt bleibst
du eine halbe Stunde da, und wenn du dann wieder hineingehst, sag, ich
hab' dich gev√∂gelt¬†...¬´

¬ªDas trau' ich mich nicht¬†...¬´, meinte ich.

¬ªA, was¬†..., er darf dir nichts tun und wird dir nichts tun¬´, redete er
mir zu. ¬ªEr hat dich ja selber zu mir gehen gehei√üen.¬´

Wir lagen ruhig beisammen. Ich wartete.

¬ªAlso¬†..., wenn er dich fragt, ob ich dich gepudert hab', sagst du ja¬´,
fing er wieder an. Ich fragte verwundert: ¬ªWerden Sie mich denn nicht
v√∂geln?¬´

¬ªNein¬´, lehnte er ab, ¬ªich hab' grad vorhin meine Geliebte gev√∂gelt,
zweimal¬†..., ich kann nicht mehr¬†...¬´

¬ªDeswegen¬†...¬´, ich fa√üte ihn bei seinem ausgesch√∂pften Brunnen. ¬ªEs
wird schon gehen¬†...¬´

¬ªJa, willst denn du¬†...?¬´ er nahm meine Br√ºste.

¬ªIch m√∂cht' schon¬†...¬´, gab ich zur√ºck.

¬ªNa, ich glaube nicht, aber ich werd' probieren¬†...¬´

¬ªSoll ich ihn in den Mund nehmen¬†...?¬´ erbot ich mich.

¬ªWart¬†...¬´, meinte Rudolf, ¬ªich werde dir was zeigen, wo du auch was
davon hast¬†...¬´

Ich mu√üte mich auf ihn legen, aber mit dem Kopf nach unten. So konnte
ich seine Nudel mit Wiederbelebungsversuchen best√ºrmen, indem er seine
Lippen und seine Zunge in meine Schamlippen vergrub.

Diese Doppelarbeit war mir noch neu, aber sie erschien mir √§u√üerst
rentabel. W√§hrend ich mich um seine erschlaffte Stange ohne Erfolg
bem√ºhte, schmeichelte er mir es ab, da√ü es mir alle Augenblicke kam, und
ich hielt seinen Knebel gerne im Mund, denn er hinderte mich am Schreien
und Seufzen, was ich sonst vor Wonne gewi√ü getan h√§tte, was ich aber
meines Vaters wegen gerne unterlie√ü.

Die Situation tat das ihrige, auch Rudolf in Aufregung zu bringen, und
wie ich bemerkte, da√ü aus seinen Ruinen neues Leben zu bl√ºhen anfing,
drehte ich mich um und da ich schon einmal oben auf lag, f√ºgte ich
rittlings zusammen, was zusammengeh√∂rte.

Das laute Schnaufen hielten wir alle beide zur√ºck, Rudolf und ich. Aber
er remmelte in langen St√∂√üen, und als er spritzte, hob er mich so hoch
in die H√∂he, da√ü ich beinahe zum Bett hinausgefallen w√§re.

¬ªGeh jetzt wieder hinein¬†...¬´, sagte er, als alles vor√ºber war.

Ich f√ºrchtete mich und erkl√§rte Rudolf:

¬ªIch f√ºrcht' mich¬†...¬´

¬ªL√§cherlich¬´, meinte er, ¬ªwenn er was will, soll er nur kommen. Sag ihm
nur, da√ü er dich selbst herausgeschickt hat¬†...¬´

Ich schlich ins Zimmer zur√ºck. Der Vater r√ºhrte sich nicht. Wie ich aber
hin ins Bett kam, fragte er: ¬ªNa, was ist¬†...?¬´

¬ªNichts¬†...¬´, sagte ich leise.

¬ªWas war denn?¬´ fuhr er fort.

¬ªNichts¬´, erwiderte ich.

¬ªWas hat er denn von dir wollen¬†...?¬´

¬ªSie wissen schon, Vater¬†...¬´, erwiderte ich.

¬ªHat er dich gev√∂gelt¬†...?¬´ fuhr er mich an.

¬ªJa¬†..., aber Sie haben mich ja hinausgeschickt¬†...¬´

¬ªGev√∂gelt hat er dich¬†...?¬´

¬ªIch kann ja nichts daf√ºr¬†...¬´, beschwichtigte ich ihn.

¬ªGleich gehst her¬†...¬´, herrschte er mich an.

Ich kroch gehorsam zu ihm ins Bett hin√ºber, unter seine Decke.

¬ªWas schaffen S' denn, Vater¬†...?¬´

Er warf sich ungest√ºm auf mich und pre√üte mir die Beine auseinander. Ich
nahm seinen Pflock, der noch nie so hart war.

¬ªLassen S' gut sein¬†...¬´, sagte ich, ¬ªwir machen's deswegen doch, sooft
Sie wollen¬†..., und den Kerl lass ich nicht mehr dr√ºber¬†...¬´

¬ªHalt's Maul, du Hur!¬´ raunte er mir zu, ¬ªdu bist ja doch nur eine
Hur¬†...¬´

Und er trieb mir ohne R√ºcksicht den Schweif bis an den Magen in den
Leib.

¬ªJetzt hat sie der auch gev√∂gelt¬†..., der auch¬†...¬´, keuchte er dabei.
¬ªHat er dir's vielleicht in den Mund gesteckt¬†...¬´

¬ªMir kommt's¬†..., Vater¬†..., mir kommt's¬†..., bei Ihnen kommt's
mir¬†...¬´, rief ich.

¬ªOb er dir's auch in den Mund gesteckt hat¬†...¬´

¬ªJa¬†..., √ºberall hat er mir's hingesteckt¬†...¬´, ich sagte, was er h√∂ren
wollte, ¬ªund die Fut hat er mir ausgeschleckt ... und mir kommt's¬†...,
schneller¬†..., schneller.¬´

¬ªIst dir's bei ihm auch gekommen¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬†...¬´, ich genierte mich nicht mehr, ¬ªja¬†..., ein paarmal ist's mir
gekommen.¬´

Und ich hatte noch nicht diese Worte ausgesprochen, da schmetterte er
mir seine Ladung gegen die Geb√§rmutter.

Dann schliefen wir beide ersch√∂pft ein. Am andern Morgen war nicht mehr
die Rede davon.

Wenige Tage sp√§ter war ein Feiertag. Mein Vater und Rudolf hatten nichts
mehr miteinander gesprochen. Rudolf schlief, wenn mein Vater fortging,
und mein Vater schlief, wenn Rudolf nach Hause kam.

An diesem Feiertag nun, wir hatten eben genachtmahlt, und der Vater
rauchte noch seine Pfeife, kam Rudolf pl√∂tzlich nach Hause. Es war halb
neun, also eine ungewohnte Stunde.

Er trat freundlich gr√º√üend ins Zimmer und stellte zwei Weinflaschen auf
den Tisch.

¬ªGr√º√ü Ihnen Gott, Herr Nachbar¬†...¬´, rief er, ¬ªtrinken wir keinen Wein
miteinander¬†...?¬´

Der Vater, der gerne trank, l√§chelte und sagte: ¬ªMeinetwegen¬†...¬´

Und Rudolf fuhr bezeichnungsvoll fort: ¬ªDeswegen keine Feindschaft,
was?¬´

¬ªNein¬´, lachte der Vater, ¬ªkeine Feindschaft¬†..., Sie meinen wegen der
Peperl¬†...?¬´

¬ªHerr Nachbar¬´, rief Rudolf, ¬ªSie sind ein fescher Kerl. Sind wir
lustig. Von heut an bin ich vazierend, machen wir uns einen guten
Abend¬†..., wollen S'?¬´

¬ªGilt schon¬´, rief der Vater, und ich dachte, Rudolfs Vorschlag werde
darauf hinauslaufen, da√ü mich alle zwei v√∂geln wollen.

Aber Rudolf f√ºhrte ganz anderes im Schild. ¬ªGestatten schon, Herr
Nachbar, da√ü meine Geliebte auch dabei ist¬†...¬´, fragte er.

¬ªWas f√ºr eine Geliebte¬†...?¬´ erwiderte der Vater staunend.

¬ªSie steht n√§mlich am Gang drau√üen¬†...¬´ erkl√§rte Rudolf.

¬ªAber bitte, bitte¬†..., sie soll nur hereinkommen.¬´

Rudolf ging hinaus und kam gleich darauf mit seiner Geliebten zur√ºck.
Sie war etwa f√ºnfzehn Jahre vorbei, mager, mit einer aufgest√ºlpten Nase,
frechen Augen und einem breiten Mund. Nur ihr Busen fiel mir auf. Er war
f√ºr ihre Magerkeit erstaunlich gro√ü und stand weit auseinander, straff
und fest. Sie ging aber absichtlich so, da√ü er bei jedem Schritt
zitterte.

Die Unterhaltung begann. Rudolf war sehr heiter, und Zenzi, seine
Geliebte, lachte zu jedem Wort, das er sagte.

Auch mein Vater lachte immer mehr, je mehr er trank, und wir alle hatten
bald einen Schwips.

Der Wein ging schon bald zur Neige, als Rudolf die Zenzi umschlang und
ihren Busen in die Hand nahm.

¬ªDas ist ein Brusterl, Herr Nachbar, hart wie Stein¬†...¬´, sagte er.

Zenzi lachte laut auf, und der Vater schielte auf die Brust von ihr, die
Rudolf in der Hand hielt.

¬ªGreifen Sie es nur an¬´, ermunterte ihn Rudolf, ¬ªwann gef√§llig ist¬†...,
ich tu' nicht eifern, greifen S' nur zu¬†...¬´

Mein Vater r√ºhrte sich nicht. Rudolf lie√ü Zenzi los und kam zu mir. ¬ªJa,
die Peperl¬´, sagte er, ¬ªdie hat auch sch√∂ne harte Duterln ... sehr
sch√∂ne sogar¬†..., grad so sch√∂n wie die Zenzi¬†...¬´; er nahm ungeniert
vor dem Vater meine Br√ºste in die Hand. ¬ªAber kleiner sind sie als der
Zenzi ihre und nicht so spitzig¬†..., mehr rund¬†...¬´

Zenzi lachte laut auf.

¬ªZenzi¬†...¬´, gebot Rudolf, ¬ªzeig dem Herrn da deine Duteln¬†...¬´

Gehorsam kn√∂pfte sie ihr Leibchen auf, l√∂ste die Achselspange ihres
Hemdes, da√ü es herunterglitt, und die eine Brust hervorsprang. Sie
lachte und ging zu meinem Vater hin.

Es war wirklich merkw√ºrdig, wie spitz und fest ihre Brust wegstand, und
die Warze darauf war wie ein neuer, kleiner, frisch angelegter Busen.
Ich schaute sie bewundernd an, ohne darauf zu achten, da√ü Rudolf mir ins
Hemd gefahren war und meine Brust in der Hand hielt.

¬ªNa, was sagen Sie¬´, fragte Rudolf meinen Vater.

¬ªSehr sch√∂n¬†..., sehr sch√∂n¬†...¬´ Der Vater konnte nicht widerstehen. Er
streckte die Hand aus und lie√ü die Brust von Zenzi auf- und
niederspringen. Sie lachte nur.

¬ªRevanche¬†..., Herr Nachbar¬†...¬´, lachte Rudolf.

Der Vater nahm jetzt die Brust ganz in die Hand. Zenzi trat n√§her zu ihm
und lachte nur.

¬ªZenzi¬†...¬´, kommandierte Rudolf, ¬ªspiel mit dem Herrn ein bisserl¬†...¬´

Gehorsam kn√∂pfte sie meinem Vater die Hose auf, und ich sah, wie
geschickt sie den Schwanz herausnahm und wie sie ihn streichelte, dann
nahm sie noch die Eier mit dazu und rieb sanft an ihnen. Dabei schaute
sie meinem Vater immerzu ins Gesicht und lachte.

¬ªWenn Sie die Zenzi v√∂geln wollen, bitte¬†..., mit Vergn√ºgen¬†...¬´, rief
Rudolf, ¬ªist nur die Revanche, Herr Nachbar¬†...¬´

Mein Vater lie√ü sich das Bajonett wichsen und gab keine Antwort.

¬ªZenzi¬´, befahl Rudolf, ¬ªdu wirst dich von dem Herrn pudern lassen,
verstehst¬†...?¬´

Zenzi mi√üverstand das, hob ihre R√∂cke auf und wollte sich meinem Vater
aufs Knie setzen.

¬ªZenzi¬´, rief Rudolf streng, ¬ªwas macht man erst¬†...?¬´

Sie kniete augenblicklich nieder, und im Nu verschwand die Nudel, die
meinem Vater zur Hose herausstand, so lang sie war, in ihrem Mund.

Rudolf stand auf: ¬ªAlsdann, ich lass sie Ihnen da¬†..., Herr Nachbar¬´,
sagte er, ¬ªund die Peperl nimm ich mit mir, wollen Sie¬†...?¬´

Mein Vater nickte nur mit dem Kopf.

Rudolf aber trat nochmals zu ihm. ¬ªH√∂r auf zu schlecken, Zenzi¬´, sagte
er. Sie hielt inne und sah ihn an.

¬ªPassen S' auf, Herr Nachbar¬´, wiederholte Rudolf. ¬ªIch lass Ihnen die
Zenzi da, und Sie v√∂geln die Zenzi, und ich nehm' mir die Peperl mit und
v√∂gel die Peperl¬†...¬´

¬ªGehn Sie vorne¬´, keuchte der Vater, stand auf und warf die Zenzi brutal
aufs Bett. Sie lachte laut. Aber er warf sich √ºber sie und mit ihrer
aalglatten Geschicklichkeit hatte sie ihn sofort auf den rechten Weg
gebracht.

Wir sahen, wie er losstie√ü und h√∂rten Zenzi wispern: ¬ªTu nur sch√∂n
v√∂geln¬†..., tu nur sch√∂n pudern¬†..., sch√∂n fickerln¬†..., jaa?¬´

Rudolf geriet pl√∂tzlich in Aufregung und ich auch.

¬ªAh was¬´, sagte er, ¬ªda werden wir uns auch nicht genieren.¬´

Damit warf er mich aufs andere Bett, legte sich drauf, und ich empfing
seine St√∂√üe.

Es war ein sch√∂nes Quartett.

Der Vater schnaufte: ¬ªHer mit der Dutel¬†..., so¬†..., sto√ü noch besser
mit dem Arsch¬†..., so ist's gut¬†...¬´

Rudolf keuchte: ¬ªHimmelkruzit√ºrken¬†..., das ist gut¬†..., so hab' ich's
gern¬†..., nur langsam, wir haben Zeit.¬´

Ich quietschte: ¬ªMir kommt's¬†..., mir kommt's¬†..., Vater¬†...,
Rudolf¬†..., mir kommt's.¬´

Und Zenzi wisperte: ¬ªAch¬†..., fickere mich¬†..., mach mir ein Kind¬†...,
fickere mich¬†..., ja¬†..., bei√ü mir die Dutel ab¬†..., bei√ü mir die Dutel
ab¬†..., Rudolf¬†..., der fickt mich¬†..., er fickt mich¬†...¬´

Nacheinander spritzten der Vater und Rudolf, und ihr Bellen, St√∂hnen,
R√∂cheln, Schnaufen vermengte sich mit dem Quietschen, Seufzen und
Keuchen von Zenzi und mir, und mit dem Krachen der beiden Betten.

Wie sie fertig waren, rief Rudolf seine Zenzi: ¬ªKomm hinaus,
schlafen¬†...¬´

Sie wand sich unter meinem Vater hervor, und im Abgehen sagte Rudolf:
¬ªJa, Herr Nachbar¬†..., die zweite Nummer macht jeder mit der
Seinigen¬†...¬´

Mein Vater w√§lzte sich zu mir herbei und begann gleich das Busenspiel
wieder, und ich trachtete seinen kleinen Bruder meinen Bettzapfen wieder
in die H√∂he zu bringen.

Weil das nicht gleich gehen wollte, wandte ich die neue Kunst an, die
mich Rudolf neulich gelehrt hatte. Ich gab ihm meine Pastete als
Umschlag √ºber das Gesicht und nahm seinen Schweif als Erfrischungsbonbon
in den Mund, und wie wir dann das Resultat genossen und ich mich
umdrehen konnte, um mich meinen Vater unterzulegen, h√∂rten wir von
drau√üen Zenzi: ¬ªFick mich¬†..., Rudi¬†..., fick mich¬†..., du machst es am
besten von allen¬†..., ah Rudi¬†..., Rudi¬†..., wie viel' Schw√§nz' hab' ich
schon hereinlassen m√ºssen¬†..., aber du machst es am besten¬†..., fick
noch¬†..., so¬†..., so¬†..., hinaus¬†..., herein¬†..., ah¬†..., ah¬†..., ich
tu', was du willst, Rudi¬†...¬´

Und Rudolf sagte: ¬ªHalt's Maul, dumme Gans¬†..., gib die Fut her und la√ü
mich v√∂geln¬†...¬´

¬ªMacht sie's gut¬†...?¬´ fragte ich, w√§hrend der Vater die ersten St√∂√üe
tat.

¬ªJa¬†..., sehr gut¬†..., so warm und so fest halten tut sie einen
damit¬†...¬´

¬ªBesser als ich¬†...¬´, fragte ich und lie√ü meinen Popo tanzen.

¬ªNein¬†..., nein¬†..., ach¬†..., fester mit dem Popo¬†..., fester¬†...¬´

Und ich entgegnete: ¬ªFick mich¬†..., fick mich¬†..., gut¬†..., so¬†..., du
machst es am besten¬†...¬´

Das hatte ich soeben von Zenzi gelernt.

Zenzi blieb nun einfach bei uns. Sie schlief bei Rudolf in der K√ºche und
ging bei Tage mit ihren spitzigen, hippenden Br√ºsten bei mir im Zimmer
herum. Auch sie war mir zuwider, doch lie√ü sie sich so viel von mir
gefallen, war immer so freundlich mit mir und f√ºgte sich so geduldig und
gehorsam in alles, da√ü ich mich bald an sie gew√∂hnte. Sie schlief
manchmal beim Vater, und in solchen N√§chten lag ich bei Rudolf. Der
Vater und Rudolf vertrugen sich ausgezeichnet und teilten sich nach
Laune in uns beiden. Rudolf zog daher nie den K√ºrzeren, denn da er
vazierend war, blieb er oft tagelang zu Hause, und dann nahm er uns zwei
auf einmal vor.

Einmal, als ich nach Hause kam und ins Haustor trat, fand ich Zenzi, die
gerade von Herrn Horak an der Brust abgegriffen wurde. Ich ging vorbei,
Zenzi rief mir ¬ªServus¬´ zu, und Horak beachtete mich kaum.

Oben sa√ü Rudolf in der K√ºche.

¬ªHast du die Zenzi nicht g'sehen?¬´ fragte er mich.

Ich dachte ihr was Ordentliches einzubrocken und sagte: ¬ªJa, unten in
der Einfahrt steht sie¬†...¬´

¬ªMit wem¬†...?¬´ fragte Rudolf lauernd.

¬ªMit dem Herrn Horak¬†...¬´, sagte ich.

¬ªSo¬†...? Was tut sie denn mit ihm¬†...?¬´

¬ªIch wei√ü nicht¬†...¬´, meinte ich gleichg√ºltig, ¬ªich hab' nur gesehen,
da√ü er sie bei den Duteln angreift¬†...¬´

¬ªNa alsdann¬†...¬´, lachte Rudolf, ¬ªwenn's ihm eine Freude macht¬†...¬´

Zenzi blieb lange aus. Als sie endlich kam, ging Rudolf mit ihr in die
K√ºche. Ich erwartete ein furchtbares Strafgericht und horchte:

¬ªWo warst denn so lang¬†...?¬´ begann er.

¬ªHat mich schon gev√∂gelt¬†...¬´, sagte sie lachend.

¬ªWo denn¬†...?¬´ fragte Rudolf erstaunt.

¬ªIm Keller¬†...¬´, beichtete Zenzi.

¬ªNa und¬†...?¬´ forschte Rudolf.

¬ªZwei Gulden¬†..., da hast¬†...¬´ Zenzi gab ihm Geld. Rudolf lachte und
lie√ü sich von ihr Zigaretten holen.

Dieser Vorfall setzte mich nicht weiter in Erstaunen, denn ich wu√üte,
da√ü Herr Horak manchmal etwas schenkte. Er hatte ja auch mir Geld
gegeben.

Nach ein paar Tagen aber kam Zenzi in der D√§mmerstunde mit einem Herrn
nach Hause. Sie √∂ffnete die T√ºr ein wenig und fl√ºsterte Rudolf zu: ¬ªEs
ist wer da.¬´

¬ªKomm ins Zimmer¬´, sagte Rudolf zu mir.

Wir gingen hinein, und gleich darauf h√∂rten wir M√§nnerschritte in der
K√ºche.

Rudolf horchte. Ich trat neben ihm zur T√ºre.

Zenzi redete mit einem Manne: ¬ªMach dir's bequem¬†...¬´

¬ªAch nein¬†...¬´, antwortete er, ¬ªich mach' nur die Hose auf¬†...¬´

Gleich darauf Zenzi: ¬ªJa¬†..., das Schwanzerl¬†..., wie das steht¬†...¬´

Und der Mann: ¬ªGib das Hemd weg von der Brust¬†...¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªSoll ich mich ganz ausziehn¬†...?¬´

Der Mann: ¬ªBesser w√§r's schon¬†...¬´

Eine Pause folgte. Dann h√∂rte man das dumpfe Ger√§usch, wie wenn jemand
auf's Bett f√§llt.

Zenzi sagte: ¬ªGehn S' her¬†...¬´

Sofort h√∂rten wir sie aufseufzen: ¬ªAh¬†..., fick mich¬†..., tu nur sch√∂n
v√∂gerln¬†..., so¬†...¬´

Der Mann unterbrach sie: ¬ªSei ruhig¬†..., ich kann das Reden beim Pudern
nicht leiden¬†...¬´

¬ªViechkerl¬†...¬´, fl√ºsterte Rudolf.

Ich war vom Zuh√∂ren aufgeregt und machte mich an Rudolfs Hosent√ºrl. Er
stie√ü mich fort: ¬ªLa√ü gehn¬†...¬´, zischte er, ¬ªich hab' jetzt keine
Zeit¬†...¬´

Drau√üen krachte das Bett. Der Mann √§chzte, Zenzi schnaufte. Endlich
h√∂rten wir sie lachen: ¬ªAus is¬†...¬´

Der Mann stieg aus dem Bett, und Zenzi sagte: ¬ªDa bist du ja gleich
angezogen¬†...¬´

Geldst√ºcke klirrten. Die T√ºr ging leise auf. Der Mann war fort. Zenzi
kam herein. Sie war nackt und lachte und hielt Rudolf drei Gulden hin.

¬ªDrei Gulden hab' ich gekriegt¬†...¬´

Rudolf nahm das Geld und steckte es ein. Dann sagte er: ¬ªZieh dich an.¬´

Zenzi zog sich an und erz√§hlte, was f√ºr ein feiner Mann das gewesen war,
und da√ü er einen kleinen dicken Schwanz gehabt hatte. Rudolf unterbrach
sie und schickte sie um Wein und Zigaretten. Kaum war sie fort, fragte
er: ¬ªMagst du jetzt v√∂geln¬†...?¬´

Er lie√ü mir keine Zeit zur Antwort, warf mich gegen die Wand und rieb
mir stehend seinen Kl√∂ppel hinein, da√ü mir die Suppe bis zum Knie
hinunterlief.

¬ªSo¬´, sagte er dann, ¬ªund heut schlafst du bei mir¬†...¬´

Als der Vater nach Hause kam, wurde der Wein getrunken. Rudolf und der
Vater waren schwer berauscht und der Vater griff Zenzi immer unter die
R√∂cke.

¬ªIch m√∂cht'¬†..., ich m√∂cht'¬†...¬´, lallte er.

¬ªZieh dich aus¬†...¬´, verlangte Rudolf. Sie tat es sofort.

¬ªDu auch¬†...¬´, sagte der Vater zu mir. Ich zog mich ebenso nackt aus,
wie Zenzi.

Rudolf und der Vater sa√üen nebeneinander auf dem Ledersofa und riefen
uns. Wir gingen beide zu ihnen, und Rudolf wollte mich anfassen.

¬ªNein¬†...¬´, lallte mein Vater, ¬ªmeine Tochter v√∂gel ich selber¬†...,
meine Tochter braucht nicht mit fremden Leuten zu pudern, die sie gar
nichts angehen¬†...¬´

Schon wollte Rudolf heftig werden, aber Zenzi sa√ü gleich auf seinem
Scho√ü und versorgte sich mit seinem Vorrat. Ich hockte mich auf den
Vater und gleichzeitig ging das St√∂pseln los. Der Vater griff nach
Zenzis spitzer Brust, die ihn immer anlockte, und Rudolf nach der
meinigen.

In dieser Nacht schliefen wir alle in den beiden Betten. Zenzi und ich
konnten nicht schlafen, aber die M√§nner schnarchten.

Da sagte Zenzi: ¬ªWillst du v√∂geln?¬´

¬ªJa¬´, meinte ich, ¬ªaber die sind ja nicht zu erwecken.¬´

¬ªDas macht nichts¬†...¬´, lachte sie, ¬ªich kenn' das schon, wenn der
Rudolf besoffen ist, puder ich trotzdem mit ihm.¬´

Sie nahm seinen Schweif, der sich sofort aufrichtete.

Ich holte den v√§terlichen Gnadenspender hervor und wollte ihn in den
Mund nehmen.

¬ªAber nicht¬†...¬´, wehrte Zenzi ab, ¬ªwenn er doch schlaft und besoffen
ist, so spritzt er dir in den Mund hinein. Wenn einer nur schlaft, aber
nicht besoffen ist, so wacht er auf, wenn du ihn schleckst. Wenn er aber
einen Rausch hat, nachher spritzt er gleich.¬´

Beide Kerzen standen nun sch√∂n gerade vor uns. ¬ªWelchen willst du?¬´
fragte ich Zenzi.

Aber sie ref√ºsierte: ¬ªGar keinen¬†..., ich hab' genug gefickt schon¬†...,
ich mag keinen mehr¬†...¬´

¬ªJa, was machen wir?¬´ meinte ich.

¬ªNa¬†..., du nimmst alle zwei¬†...¬´, lachte sie.

Ich hockte mich nach ihrer Anordnung zuerst √ºber meinen Vater, mit dem
R√ºcken zu seinem Gesicht, so als ob ich mein Wasser lassen wollte. Zenzi
leistete mir Beistand, und setzte mir den Zahn in jenen Mund, in dem man
ewig zahnlos bleibt.

Kaum sp√ºrte ich den Stachel, als ich auf- und niederrutschte.

¬ªIst's so gut¬†...?¬´ fragte Zenzi.

¬ªJa¬†..., ach¬†..., ja¬†...¬´, gab ich zur Antwort.

¬ªWart, ich zeig' dir was¬†...¬´

Sie hockte vor mir, griff mit der Hand hinunter und streichelte mit dem
Finger meinen Kitzler, der in dieser Stellung unber√ºhrt geblieben w√§re.
Ich tanzte heftiger und mein Vater st√∂hnte im Schlaf.

Zenzi nahm meine Brust in den Mund und sog leise daran. Sie machte es so
zart, so leise, da√ü es mir sofort kam. Sie sog weiter und es wollte mir
zum zweitenmal die Wonne losbrechen, als ich vom Vater die volle Ladung
bekam. Er spritzte einen ganzen Eimer aus, als ob ihm der getrunkene
Wein zum Schwanz herausfahren wollte. Aber es geschah mit zwei
Zuckungen, und sein Schaft wurde augenblicklich so weich, da√ü er mir
entwischte und kraftlos zusammenfiel.

¬ªKomm jetzt zum Rudolf¬†...¬´, dr√§ngte Zenzi, denn ich jammerte: ¬ªO
je¬†..., jetzt grad w√§r's mir gekommen.¬´

Sie rutschte mir nach und √ºbernahm auch dort die Vermittlung. Und ich
hatte kaum diese neue Steife bei mir, als ich auf und niedersprang, mich
dabei an Zenzi hielt, und ihr mein Liedchen vorsang: ¬ªMir kommt's¬†...,
ach¬†..., mir kommt's¬†...¬´

Rudolf knirschte mit den Z√§hnen und keuchte, aber er erwachte nicht, so
gro√ü war sein Rausch, und so tief sein Schlaf.

¬ªMir kommt's¬†..., Zenzi¬†..., mir kommt's¬´, √§chzte ich.

Sie l√§chelte: ¬ªBeim Rudolf kommt's einem immer¬†...¬´, meinte sie.

Ich packte ihre glatten, spitzen Br√ºste, und spielte damit. Ich mu√üte es
pl√∂tzlich tun, ohne zu wissen warum. Aber es erh√∂hte meine Wollust
unbeschreiblich, und ich machte es, da√ü mir nichts zu kommen mehr blieb.

¬ªIch bin fertig¬†...¬´, seufzte ich, ¬ªla√ü mich herunter¬†...¬´

¬ªBleib¬†...¬´, befahl sie, ¬ªerst mu√ü der Rudolf spritzen.¬´

Und sie zwang mich, ihm seine Stange zu reiben und aus seinem Brunnen zu
sch√∂pfen, bis das Wasser flo√ü. Es stieg wie eine Font√§ne hoch hinauf,
und ich lie√ü es in mich hineinspritzen, bis kein Tropfen mehr kam. Dann
sanken wir beide, Zenzi und ich, zwischen die schlafenden M√§nner und
lagen beieinander.

Aber diese Nacht war noch nicht vorbei. Zenzi war jetzt doch wieder
aufgeregt und jammerte: ¬ªO je¬†..., o je¬†..., jetzt m√∂cht' ich¬†...,
jetzt¬†..., m√∂cht' ich¬†...¬´

¬ªNa, so mach du's¬†...¬´, riet ich ihr.

¬ªAber nein¬†...¬´, sie war ganz weg, ¬ªjetzt wird er ihnen nicht mehr
stehen.¬´

¬ªProbier's doch¬†...¬´, ermunterte ich sie.

Sie glitt zum Vater hin und begann ihn zu streicheln und zu reiben.
Umsonst. Sie nahm seinen Schweif in den Mund¬†..., der Vater sp√ºrte
nichts, auch im Schlaf nicht, und seine Lanze blieb gesenkt.

¬ªNichts ist¬†...¬´, klagte Zenzi; und wandte sich zu Rudolf. Auch sein
Gewehr war ausgeschossen, und der Hahn lie√ü sich nicht mehr spannen, wie
wohl sich Zenzi auch bem√ºhte. Endlich nahm sie ihn in den Mund, sog
zweimal daran und begann pl√∂tzlich zu husten und zu schlucken.

¬ªEr spritzt¬†...¬´, rief sie verzweifelt, ¬ªer spritzt¬†...¬´, und dabei
hielt sie seinen Zipfel in die H√∂he, aus dem der Same matt herausquoll.
Zenzi spuckte aus und kam zu mir.

¬ªO Gott¬†..., o Gott¬†...¬´, jammerte sie verzweifelt, ¬ªdas Schlecken und
Spritzen hat mich noch viel geiler gemacht¬†...¬´

Ich lachte.

¬ªDu kannst leicht lachen¬†...¬´, grollte sie, ¬ªdu hast's gut gehabt¬†...,
ich war sch√∂n dumm¬†...¬´

Ich lachte noch mehr.

¬ªWas fang' ich an¬†...¬´, fragte sie verzweifelnd, und wetzte ihn hin und
her. Auf einmal ri√ü sie meine Hand an sich und f√ºhrte sich sie zwischen
die F√º√üe: ¬ªMach mir's¬†...¬´, bat sie.

¬ªWie soll ich dir's denn machen¬†...?¬´

¬ªWei√üt¬†..., so¬†..., komm¬†..., ich will v√∂geln¬†..., komm¬†...¬´

Sie legte sich auf den R√ºcken: ¬ªLeg dich auf mich¬†...¬´

Ich tat wie sie wollte, und sie rieb sich zuerst ihre Fut gegen die
meine. Dann mu√üte ich meine Hand dazwischen geben, und sie mit dem
Finger sto√üen, als h√§tte sie einen Schwanz.

Sie warf sich unter mir: ¬ªAch¬†..., ja¬†..., das ist gut¬†..., steck den
Finger hinein¬†...¬´

Meine Br√ºste, die auf sie niederhingen, ergriff sie, und t√§tschelte sie
eifrig und mit meiner freien Hand spielte ich an ihrer Brust.

Endlich schrie sie auf: ¬ªMir kommt's¬†..., mir kommt's¬†...¬´

Ich bohrte ihr den Finger hinein, so gut ich konnte, und f√ºhlte, wie
ihre Fut zusammenschnappte. Sie lie√ü meine Brust los, dr√ºckte mir den
Kopf, indem sie mich umschlang fest an ihre Duteln, und ruhte nicht
eher, bis ich auch ihre kr√§ftigen spitzen Warzen im Mund hatte. Mich
reizte dieses Spiel. Ich sog an ihren frischen Br√ºsten und bohrte unten
mit dem Finger, bis sie ausgetobt hatte und mit langen Atemz√ºgen
beruhigt dalag. Dann schliefen wir ein.

Wir waren seit dieser Nacht wirklich befreundet, und es kam oft vor, da√ü
ich wie ein Mann √ºber sie herfiel, ihre Brust herausnahm und daran
spielte.

Am n√§chsten Tag schliefen wir alle bis in den hellen Vormittag. Der
Vater ging nicht in die Arbeit, und Lorenz kam aus der Sattlerei
nachzuschauen, was es g√§be.

¬ªNichts¬´, sagte der Vater, ¬ªich bin krank.¬´

Lorenz ging, ohne einen von uns eines Blickes zu w√ºrdigen.

Die Trinkgelage wiederholten sich, und es wiederholte sich, da√ü Zenzi
mit einem Mann nach Hause kam. Rudolf dachte nicht daran, sich wieder um
eine Stelle umzusehen.

Einmal kam Zenzi, und wir h√∂rten an der Stimme des Mannes, da√ü er sehr
alt sein m√ºsse.

Zenzi lachte: ¬ªJa, so ein kleines Wuzerl¬†...¬´

Der alte Mann sagte: ¬ªDas macht nichts¬†..., das macht nichts¬†..., wenn
er steht, wird er schon gr√∂√üer werden¬†...¬´

Nach einer Weile rief Zenzi: ¬ªAber er steht ja nicht¬†...¬´

Der alte Mann: ¬ªEs dauert nur ein bisserl l√§nger¬†..., er wird schon
stehen.¬´

Wieder nach einer Weile sagte Zenzi leise: ¬ªIch kann nicht mehr¬†..., mir
tut schon die Hand weh¬†...¬´

Der alte Mann: ¬ªDas macht nichts¬†..., nimm's nur in den Mund¬†...¬´

Zenzi fragte: ¬ªWas geben S' mir dann?¬´

Der alte Mann: ¬ªWas ich dir geb'¬†...? Meinetwegen¬†..., ich geb' dir zehn
Gulden¬†..., aber nimm's in den Mund¬†...¬´

Rudolf gab es einen Ruck: ¬ªHerrschaft!¬´ murmelte er, und ich war ganz
erschrocken √ºber das viele Geld.

Es dauerte lange, bis Zenzi endlich sagte: ¬ªSo, er steht schon¬†...,
kommen S' her¬†...¬´

Wir h√∂rten, wie sie ins Bett fielen. Nach einer kurzen Pause lachte
Zenzi auf: ¬ªEr steht ja schon wieder nicht¬†...¬´

Der alte Mann murmelte etwas, sie w√§lzten sich im Bett herum, dann brach
Zenzi los: ¬ªAch¬†..., ach¬†..., ja¬†..., so¬†..., das ist gut¬†..., gut¬†...,
ja¬†..., weiter¬†..., schneller¬†...¬´

Rudolf meinte zu mir: ¬ªJetzt schleckt er sie¬†...¬´

Dann rief Zenzi: ¬ªKommen S', jetzt steht er wieder¬†...¬´

Sie w√§lzten sich noch einmal, und Zenzi lachte; ¬ªist schon wieder
zusammengefallen¬†...¬´

Der alte Mann sagte √§rgerlich: ¬ªIst nicht wahr¬†..., steck ihn nur
hinein¬†...¬´

Das Bett krachte, und Zenzi sagte: ¬ªSie sind ja gar nicht drin¬†...¬´

Der alte Mann: ¬ªLa√ü mich nur! Ich komm' schon hinein¬†...¬´

Das Bett krachte weiter, weiter. Zenzi seufzte und rief: ¬ªSo¬†...,
endlich¬†..., aber jetzt¬†..., gut¬†..., gut fickerln¬†..., was? ... Schon
aus¬†...¬´

Wir h√∂rten sie wieder in der K√ºche herumgehen und fl√ºstern. Dann knarrte
die Eingangst√ºr und Zenzi rief: ¬ªK√º√ü die Hand¬´, und kam gleich darauf
ins Zimmer gelaufen. Sie war im Hemd und schwang einen Zehner in der
Hand. Freudig gab sie ihn Rudolf.

Nat√ºrlich fand am Abend wieder ein gro√ües Saufgelage statt. Wir waren
alle betrunken, und ich wei√ü gar nicht mehr, was wir alles getrieben
hatten. Am n√§chsten Tag verschlief mein Vater wieder die Arbeit, und
weil das jetzt √∂fters vorkam, wurde er eines Tages entlassen.

Er kam schimpfend und fluchend nach Hause, aber Rudolf tr√∂stete ihn:
¬ªDas macht nichts¬†..., du find'st bald wieder eine Arbeit.¬´ Sie waren
l√§ngst per du miteinander. Mein Vater war sehr entr√ºstet und konnte sich
nicht beruhigen.

¬ªSchlaf dich ein paar Tag aus, und dann gehst dir eine andere Arbeit
suchen¬´, meinte Rudolf, ¬ªund dir wird es guttun, wenn du dich
ausschlafst.¬´

Mein Vater begann also sich auszuschlafen. Er w√§lzte sich die Vormittage
im Bett herum, spielte mit Rudolf Karten, und verbrachte seine Zeit
damit, abwechselnd Zenzi oder mir an den Br√ºsten zu spielen. Dabei
ben√ºtzte er mich jetzt beinahe in jeder Nacht, und bei Tag machte er
sich auch noch √ºber Zenzi her, denn er war immer angetrunken.

Da er seine Tage zu Hause verbrachte, war er auch einmal anwesend, als
Zenzi mit einem Herrn nach Hause kam. Nun standen wir zu dritt hinter
der K√ºchent√ºr und lauschten, wie drau√üen das Gesch√§ft vor sich ging.

Er war sehr erstaunt, und machte gro√üe Augen, als Zenzi dann hereinkam
und ihrem Rudolf drei Gulden √ºberbrachte.

Wenige Tage sp√§ter aber kam der Hausmeister herauf und erkl√§rte, das
k√∂nne nicht mehr geduldet werden. Entweder wir m√º√üten ausziehen, oder
Zenzi d√ºrfe keine Herren mehr mitbringen. Der Hausmeister war sehr
h√∂flich, und sprach mit Rudolf besonders sehr freundlich, und Zenzi
lachte. Ich vermute, Rudolf hat ihn vorher reichlich mit Geld gespickt
und vermute auch, da√ü Zenzi sich einmal von ihm hat v√∂geln lassen, denn
sonst h√§tte er √ºberhaupt der Wirtschaft nicht so lange zugeschaut, und
w√§re wohl auch bei seinem Besuch nicht so h√∂flich und von einem solchen
Bedauern dieser Ma√üregel erf√ºllt gewesen.

Das Verbot kam vom Hausherrn direkt.

Rudolf nahm, nachdem der Hausmeister weggegangen war, Zenzi mit sich in
die K√ºche, und sie hatten eine lange Unterredung miteinander. Sie kamen
auch nachher nicht herein, sondern legten sich zusammen nieder, und man
h√∂rte sie quietschen, stammeln und ein ¬ªnoch¬´ bitten, lauter Ger√§usche,
die auch auf uns ihre Wirkung √ºbten, so da√ü wir, wenn auch einmal ohne
Wein, noch in den Kleidern anfingen, unser Spiel zu beginnen.

Zenzi blieb jetzt vom Hause fort, und kam immer erst am Abend, manchmal
sehr sp√§t in der Nacht, manchmal gar erst am n√§chsten Morgen nach Hause.
War Rudolf abends oder morgens bei uns im Zimmer, wenn sie kam, dann gab
sie ihm vor uns ihren Verdienst, und der Vater interessierte sich f√ºr
nichts so lebhaft, als f√ºr den Betrag, den sie mitgebracht hatte.

Weil nun Zenzi oft Tage und N√§chte fernblieb, und wenn sie zu Hause war,
meist schlief, hatte ich jetzt meinen Vater und Rudolf zu befriedigen,
und ich mu√üte in der Nacht manchmal von einem zum andern gehen, wenn
nicht Rudolf direkt zu uns hereinkam und sich als dritter ins Bett
legte.

Der Vater hatte Rudolf oft um Geld angegangen, und immer solches von ihm
bekommen, denn der Vater verdiente nichts und steckte nat√ºrlich schon
nach ein paar Wochen in allerlei Schwierigkeiten.

Einmal aber antwortete Rudolf auf ein solches Verlangen: ¬ªWarum verdient
denn die Peperl nichts¬†...?¬´

¬ªDie Peperl¬†...¬´, fragte der Vater und sah mich an.

¬ªNa ja¬´, meinte Rudolf, ¬ªdie k√∂nnt' doch auch so viel verdienen, wie die
Zenzi¬†...¬´

¬ªSoll sie eine Hur werden¬†...¬´, antwortete der Vater langsam.

¬ªAh was¬†..., eine Hur¬†...¬´, rief Rudolf, ¬ªjetzt tut's doch dasselbe was
die Zenzi macht¬†..., da ist nix dabei¬†..., und tausende M√§dchen m√ºssen
sich so ihr Geld verdienen¬†...¬´

¬ªDas ist schon richtig¬†...¬´, mein Vater blickte unschl√ºssig drein,
¬ªaber¬†...¬´

¬ªAber hin, aber her¬†...¬´, Rudolf hatte seinen strengen Ton, ¬ªglauben
Sie, wenn Sie das M√§del pudern, der eigene Vater, das ist vielleicht
besser¬†...? Na also ... Die Zenzi¬´, fuhr er fort, ¬ªdie Zenzi verkehrt
nur mit lauter feine Herren¬†..., die la√üt gar keinen ordin√§ren Menschen
dr√ºber. Was glauben S' denn? Die hab' ich schon dressiert¬†..., und die
Herren, von denen sich die Zenzi pudern l√§√üt, die sind alleweil noch
nobler als der Katechet, der die Peperl gefickt hat und nicht einmal was
gezahlt hat er ihr. Der Schmutzian.¬´

¬ªDer Schmutzian¬†...¬´, sagte mein Vater in nachtr√§glicher Entr√ºstung.

¬ªNa, und was m√∂cht's denn der Pepi schaden, wenn sie jetzt f√ºr ihren
Vater was verdienen t√§t?¬´ fragte Rudolf. ¬ªSie haben sich lang genug f√ºr
Ihre Kinder geplagt¬†...¬´

¬ªJa, da haben S' ganz recht¬†...¬´ pflichtete mein Vater bei.

¬ªNa also¬†..., lassen S' die Pepi nur mit der Zenzi gehn, und die bringt
Ihnen alle Tag mindestens drei Gulden nach Haus¬†..., da garantier' ich
schon daf√ºr¬†..., so ein sch√∂nes M√§del wie sie.¬´

Ich war sehr geschmeichelt, aber mein Vater fragte √§ngstlich: ¬ªUnd die
Polizei?¬´

¬ªA was, die Polizei¬†...¬´, machte Rudolf ver√§chtlich, ¬ªhab' ich
vielleicht schon einmal wegen der Zenzi einen Anstand gehabt? Lassen Sie
nur die Zenzi machen, die kennt sich aus¬†...¬´

¬ªWenn aber doch einmal¬†...¬´, mein Vater hatte Angst.

¬ªNa, und wenn schon¬†...¬´, lachte Rudolf, ¬ªnachher sagen Sie, Sie wissen
von nix¬†..., und das M√§del ist von selber so schlecht ... Die Pepi wird
Sie nicht verraten.¬´

Somit wu√üte ich also, da√ü ich mich vor der Polizei in Acht zu nehmen
hatte. Ich schwieg die ganze Zeit und wurde auch nicht gefragt. Mein
Vater √ºberlegte hin und her, dann wiederholte er: ¬ªNein, ich mag nicht,
da√ü das M√§del eine Hur wird¬†...¬´

¬ªAber davon ist doch keine Red¬´, unterbrach ihn Rudolf, ¬ªdas ist ja nur
bis Sie wieder eine Arbeit gefunden haben¬†..., dann kann ja die Pepi
auch wieder solid werden¬†...¬´

Diese Logik leuchtete meinem Vater ein, und Rudolf gewann ihn ganz, als
er hinzuf√ºgte: ¬ªIch lass' die Zenzi ja auch nur wieder v√∂geln, weil ich
vazierend bin. Bis ich eine Stelle hab', mu√ü sie wieder brav sein.¬´

Am n√§chsten Tag r√ºckte ich mit Zenzi aus. Es war beschlossen worden, und
so begann ich meine Laufbahn. Wir gingen in die innere Stadt, auf den
Graben, Stephansplatz, K√§rntnerstra√üe usw. Es war Sommer, hei√ü und wir
hatten nur leichte Blusen an. Dazu hatte mich Zenzi zu Hause gelehrt,
mir das Hemd bis zum G√ºrtel herabzulassen, so da√ü ich die Brust unter
dem Kleid blo√ü hatte.

Zenzi war sehr geschickt und lachte auf dem Wege allen M√§nnern ins
Gesicht. Ich brachte das nicht gleich zuwege, denn ich war befangen,
aber ich schaute ihnen daf√ºr ernst in die Augen und das gen√ºgte. In der
Sch√∂nlaterngasse war ein finsteres altes Haus mit einem engen finsteren
Flur. Dorthin f√ºhrte mich Zenzi. Wenn man ins Tor ging, kam man zu einer
T√ºr. Sie klopfte, und ein h√§√üliches, altes Weib √∂ffnete. Wir standen in
einer K√ºche, in der man fast gar nichts sah, und von der aus man in ein
Kabinett kam, das ebenso lichtlos war.

¬ªMeine Freundin wird auch herkommen¬´, sagte Zenzi.

Die Alte schaute mich pr√ºfend an und fragte: ¬ªSind S' schon vierzehn
Jahr vorbei¬†...?¬´ -- ¬ªSchon l√§ngst¬´, log Zenzi f√ºr mich, ¬ªsie ist nur
noch ein bisserl klein¬†...¬´

¬ªSie wissen ja¬†...¬´, sagte die Alte zu mir, ¬ªf√ºr jedesmal zahln S' mir
einen Gulden¬†..., aber Sie d√ºrfen mir nie um acht Uhr am Abend
herkommen¬†...¬´

Wir gingen wieder. Zenzi gab mir Ratschl√§ge, vor allem den, auf die
Polizeim√§nner aufzupassen, und von den Herren das Geld zu verlangen,
bevor man sie noch zulie√ü.

Wie wir wieder auf den Graben kamen, stie√ü mich Zenzi an: ¬ªDa schau¬†...,
der geht uns nach¬†...¬´

Vor uns ging ein gro√üer, sehr nobel gekleideter Mann mit einem schwarzen
Bart. Er drehte sich nach uns um und sah mich an. Dann verlangsamte er
seine Schritte und lie√ü uns vorgehen.

An der Ecke der Dorotheerstra√üe zog mich Zenzi in die enge Seitengasse.
¬ªKomm nur¬´, fl√ºsterte sie, ¬ªwir biegen ein¬†...¬´

Zenzi drehte sich um. Der Herr stand an der Ecke und blickte uns nach.
Wir standen und Zenzi winkte ihm mit dem Kopf. Da kam er auf uns zu:
¬ªKomm weiter¬†...¬´, mahnte sie, ¬ªda herau√üen spricht er nicht mit
uns¬†...¬´

Sie zog mich rasch hinter ein Haustor, dort warteten wir. ¬ªDa gehst
immer her¬´, riet mir Zenzi, ¬ªwenn du am Graben oder in der
K√§rntnerstra√üe bist¬†..., da wohnt niemand¬†...¬´

Inzwischen kam der Herr herein. Zenzi empfing ihn l√§chelnd, aber er trat
zu mir.

¬ªNa, was ist denn¬†...?¬´ sagte er.

¬ªNichts¬†...¬´, antwortete ich ihm.

Zenzi fragte ¬ªWollen S' mitgehen¬†..., in der N√§he ist eine Frau¬†..., da
kriegen wir ein Zimmer.¬´

¬ªNein¬´, fl√ºsterte er, ¬ªich hab' keine Zeit.¬´

¬ªWir k√∂nnten auch da auf die Stiegen gehn¬†..., es wohnt niemand da¬†...¬´
¬ªWillst du¬†...?¬´ fragte er mich. Ich betrachtete ihn mit gro√üer
Bewunderung, denn er sah sehr fein aus, feiner als ich je einen Mann in
der N√§he gesehen hatte. Er trug einen sch√∂nen Spazierstock mit einem
silbernen Griff und eine goldene, feine Uhrkette, die ihm um den Hals
geschlungen war.

Wir gingen die Treppe hinauf, die sehr breit und nur halb dunkel war,
und blieben auf einem Absatz stehen. ¬ªIch werd' aufpassen¬†...¬´, sagte
Zenzi, und stellte sich in einiger Entfernung von uns auf. Der feine
Herr griff mir an die Br√ºste und l√§chelte: ¬ªMach auf ein wenig.¬´

Er fuhr mit der Hand in den Spalt, den ich auftat, und war sehr
erfreut, meine Brust nackt zu finden. Ich bemerkte mit ehrerbietigem
Vergn√ºgen, da√ü seine Hand ganz weich und zart war, so zart, wie meine
eigene Haut.

¬ªAlsdann komm¬´, sagte er und sein Atem begann zu fliegen. Er kn√∂pfte
sich das Hosent√ºrl auf, und ich bekam einen Schweif in die Hand, der so
wei√ü und zart und dabei so kr√§ftig und aufrecht war, wie eine
Wachskerze. Auch der Kopf daran war spitz und zart.

Ich lehnte mich an die Wand und hob die R√∂cke auf, weil ich dachte, er
werde mich stehend v√∂geln. Aber er lehnte meine Bereitschaft ab: ¬ªLa√ü
nur¬´, meinte er, ¬ªdas trau' ich mich da nicht¬†..., spiel lieber¬†..., und
la√ü mich spielen.¬´ So fing ich an, ihm einen abzuwichsen, w√§hrend er in
meiner Bluse herumfuhr, und bald die eine, bald die andere Himbeere zum
Aufbl√ºhen brachte.

Dabei fl√ºsterte er mir zu: ¬ªSo ist's gut¬†..., mehr oben¬†...,
schneller¬†..., jetzt¬†..., wart¬†...¬´ Er reichte mir ein Taschentuch. Ich
nahm es und hielt es √ºber seine Eichel. Da zitterte er mit den Beinen,
sein Speer begann in meiner Hand zu zucken, und das Gewitter entlud
sich. Ich wischte mir die Hand auch an seinem Tuch ab, weil sie
gleichfalls angeregnet worden war. Als ich ihm das Tuch zur√ºckgab,
steckte er mir zwei Gulden zu. Dann ging er rasch die Treppen hinunter,
ohne sich nach uns umzusehen.

Ich blieb mit Zenzi noch eine Weile auf der Treppe, dann schlichen auch
wir zum Haus hinaus. Und ich war ganz gl√ºcklich. Zwei Gulden, in zwei
Minuten verdient. Und so leicht. Was hatte ich denn f√ºr M√ºhe gehabt?
Dabei war ich diesem eleganten Herrn so zugetan, bewunderte ihn so sehr,
und hatte so viel Hochachtung vor ihm, da√ü ich gewi√ü kein Geld von ihm
verlangt h√§tte.

Auf dem Stefansplatz sprach mich ein alter Mann an. Ich erschrak zuerst,
aber Zenzi stie√ü mich in die Seite und so antwortete ich, als er mich
fragte: ¬ªKann ich zu dir gehn?¬´ mit einem ¬ªJa¬´.

Er befahl mir: ¬ªGeh voraus¬†..., ich komme nach.¬´

Zenzi war im Nu von meiner Seite verschwunden, und ich schlug den Weg in
die Sch√∂nlaterngasse ein. Die Frau √∂ffnete uns, und wir waren in dem
Kabinett allein. ¬ªZieh dich aus¬†...¬´, sagte der alte Mann. W√§hrend ich
meine Kleider ablegte, konnte ich sein Gesicht betrachten. Er hatte ein
glattrasiertes Gesicht, einen zahnlosen Mund und sp√§rliche wei√üe Haare.
Dabei war er ganz mager, seine H√§nde zitterten und er schien mir
√ºberhaupt sehr gebrochen.

Er sa√ü auf dem Ledersofa und sah mir zu. Als ich nackt war, winkte er
mich heran. Ich mu√üte vor ihm stehen, und er schaute mich an, ohne sich
zu r√ºhren. Deshalb glaubte ich, es sei an mir den Anfang zu machen, und
wollte ihm die Hose √∂ffnen. Doch er schlug mich schnell auf die Finger,
da√ü ich erschrak. ¬ªWarte¬†...¬´, sagte er mit einer d√ºnnen Stimme, ¬ªwarte,
bis ich dir's sagen werde¬†..., und steh ruhig¬†...¬´

So stand ich also still vor ihm und er streichelte mich. Endlich nahm er
seinen Spazierstock und spielte damit an meiner Brust herum. Es war ein
spanisches Rohr mit einer Elfenbeinkugel. Ganz k√ºhl und glatt strich er
mir diese √ºber die Haut. Schlie√ülich setzte er sie mir unten an, und
bohrte damit meine festgeschlossenen Beine auseinander.

¬ªKomm jetzt her¬†...¬´, befahl er mir, und streckte sich auf dem Sofa aus.
Ich wollte mich zu ihm legen, aber er stie√ü mich wieder mit einer
Hastigkeit zur√ºck, die mich erschreckte: ¬ªDrunten bleiben¬´, knurrte er.

Ich mu√üte stehend seine Hose √∂ffnen, und nahm einen greisen,
ungestrafften Gnadenspender heraus, der soviel Falten hatte, als das
Jahr Stunden besitzt, und der so klein geworden war, da√ü er einem
ausgespitzten Bleistiftendchen √§hnelte. Dieses L√§ppchen Haut begann ich
zwischen den Fingern zu wuzeln, und glaubte, es werde nimmermehr eine
feste Gestalt annehmen. Ich erinnerte mich dabei an den Greis, der
unl√§ngst bei Zenzi gewesen war und ihr soviel M√ºhe bereitet hatte, aber
das Nudelchen wurde in meinen Fingern fleischiger und fester, und seine
Falten gl√§tteten sich, wie ein zerdr√ºcktes T√ºchlein unterm B√ºgeleisen
sich gl√§ttet.

¬ªMinett machen¬†...¬´, kommandierte er in einer zornigen Weise.

Ich verstand den Ausdruck nicht, und wichste flei√üiger.

¬ªMinett machen¬†...¬´, wiederholte er heftiger.

Und da ich noch immer nicht gehorchte, kreischte er mich an: ¬ªZum
Teufel, hinein!¬†...! Verstehst du nicht¬†..., Minett machen¬†...¬´

¬ªEntschuldigen Sie, gn√§diger Herr¬†...¬´, sagte ich sch√ºchtern, ¬ªich wei√ü
nicht, was das ist, ein Minett¬†...¬´

Er fand das nicht einmal lustig, sondern meinte knurrend: ¬ªIn den Mund
nehmen sollst du's¬†..., bl√∂des Ding.¬´

Ich tat, wie mir geboten war, und tat so flei√üig, wie nur je, denn ich
hatte Angst vor dem alten Mann. Wie erstaunt aber war ich, als sein
Bogen sich kraftvoll spannte, kaum da√ü ich ihn nur ein wenig gez√ºngelt
hatte. Er stieg und stieg immer h√∂her. Mein Mund konnte ihn schon nicht
mehr fassen, und als ich auf sein grobes ¬ªaufh√∂ren¬´ den Kopf zur√ºckbog
und auslie√ü, schnellte ihm ein bombenfester Schweif gegen den Bauch.

¬ªV√∂geln¬´, schnarrte er, ¬ªschnell¬†..., v√∂geln¬†..., nicht so langsam¬†...,
solltest schon draufsein.¬´ Er blieb auf dem R√ºcken liegen, und machte es
mir so, dank meiner zahlreichen Vorstudien nicht schwer, zu verstehen,
was er wollte.

Ich kroch also auf ihn hinauf und hatte M√ºhe, die Einquartierung, die er
mir bot, nur halbwegs unterzubringen.

Ich wollte mich √ºber ihn beugen, um mich festzuhalten und um ihm meine
Br√ºste n√§her zu bringen. Er aber stie√ü mich zur√ºck, und brummte:
¬ªAufrecht sitzen!¬´

So mu√üte ich aufrecht bleiben, und mich an der Sofalehne halten, wenn
ich nicht seinen Klotz tiefer im Leib haben wollte, als mir lieb war.

Er begann mich mit seinen St√∂√üen zu heben. Rasch und kr√§ftig stie√ü er zu
und redete fortw√§hrend dabei.

¬ªSo¬†..., der werd' ich's zeigen¬†..., Gott sei Dank¬†..., ich kann noch
M√§deln stemmen¬†..., so¬†...¬´ Er flog h√∂her und h√∂her. ¬ªDie braucht sich
nicht von andern ficken lassen¬†..., so¬†..., weil sie vielleicht einen
alten Mann hat¬†..., und wenn sie es tut¬†..., mach ich's auch¬†...,
so¬†..., so¬†...¬´

Er redete noch allerlei √Ñhnliches, bis er unter mir zusammenschnappte
und sich nicht r√ºhren konnte. Ich mu√üte ihm ein Glas Wein holen, und
lief, wie mir es die alte Frau angab, in den Ausschank vom heutigen
K√∂llnerhof. Als ich zur√ºckkam, lag er wie tot da und r√ºhrte sich nicht.
Mein Schrecken war gro√ü. Ich rief die Alte, die ihn mit Wasser
besprengte und mich beruhigte. Sie kannte ihn.

¬ªDas geht bei ihm immer so¬†..., er kommt aber rasch wieder zu sich¬†...¬´,
meinte sie. Richtig fuhr er auf, blickte wild umher, und als er das
Glas Wein bekam, leerte er es auf einen Zug.

Sofort war er wieder auf den Beinen, schaute mich b√∂se an und gab mir
f√ºnf Gulden. Ich f√ºhlte mich reich und h√ºpfte vor Freude in der Stube
umher. Nun sah ich ein, was ich an meiner Muschel besa√ü, und ich
beschlo√ü, sie nicht mehr zu verschenken.

Eben als ich wieder auf die Stra√üe wollte, kam Zenzi mit einem langen
jungen Mann; und wie wir uns in der K√ºche trafen, fl√ºsterte sie mir
eilig zu: ¬ªWart noch ein bissel¬†..., geh nicht fort¬†...¬´

Die T√ºre schlo√ü sich hinter den beiden, und nach einer Weile h√∂rte ich
Zenzi fragen: ¬ªSoll ich meine Freundin rufen?¬´

Der Mann antwortete mit einer d√ºnnen, zitternden Stimme: ¬ªJa, ich bitte
Sie recht sehr, tun Sie das¬†...¬´

Zenzi lief aus dem Zimmer und holte mich: ¬ªKomm herein¬´, sagte sie, ¬ªder
nimmt uns alle zwei, und der zahlt viel ... Mit dem gibt's eine Hetz,
wirst sehen¬†..., du mu√üt aber alles tun, was ich dir sag'¬†...¬´

Als wir hereintraten, erhob sich der junge Mann vom Sofa. Er war sehr
bla√ü und hager, hatte einen tiefschwarzen Vollbart, der ihn noch
bleicher erscheinen lie√ü und schwarze, traurige Augen.

Er verbeugte sich vor mir bis zur Erde, als Zenzi mich vorstellte: ¬ªDas
ist meine Freundin Josefine¬†...¬´

Ich staunte √ºber den ernsten Ton, mit dem sie das sagte: aber wie
wunderte ich mich erst, als der junge Mann meine Hand ergriff und sie
k√º√üte. Vor Verlegenheit lachte ich, und glaubte, er wolle einen Scherz
mit mir treiben. Doch Zenzi stie√ü mich an, und zischte mich an:

¬ªNicht lachen¬†..., ernst bleiben¬†...¬´

Der junge Mann erhob sich vom Handku√ü, und sagte leise, als ob er sich
vor mir f√ºrchten w√ºrde: ¬ªSo jung, mein gn√§diges Fr√§ulein, und so
streng¬†...¬´

Zenzi schrie ihn an: ¬ªDas Maul halten¬†...¬´

Er erschrak und stammelte: ¬ªEntschuldigen Sie¬†...¬´

¬ªDie Pappen halt¬†...¬´, wiederholte Zenzi w√ºtend. ¬ªRed bis du gefragt
wirst¬†...¬´

Ich erkannte sie nicht wieder. Ihr ewig l√§chelndes Gesicht war ganz
ver√§ndert.

¬ªZieh dich aus!¬´ herrschte sie ihn an.

¬ªAber nein¬´, unterbrach er sie mild, doch ohne den √ºbertrieben dem√ºtigen
Ton von fr√ºher, sondern ganz sachlich. ¬ªAber nein, das kommt ja noch
nicht¬†...¬´

¬ªWas denn¬†...?¬´ Zenzi sah ihn verlegen an.

¬ªErst kommt doch das mit den Fragen¬†...¬´, fl√ºsterte er eindringlich.

¬ªRichtig!¬´ Sie schlug sich vor die Stirne.

Sie ging von ihm fort, machte kehrt, und trat mit verfinsterten Mienen
wieder auf ihn zu: ¬ªDu Lump!¬´ schrie sie ihn an, ¬ªdu Hund, du r√§udiger,
du hast gewi√ü wieder an mich gedacht¬†..., was?¬´

Er stammelte: ¬ªGn√§digste Komtesse¬†..., ich hab' m√ºssen denken¬†...¬´

¬ªKusch¬´, unterbrach sie ihn, ¬ªgesteh, was hast du gedacht¬†...¬´

Er stammelte heiser: ¬ªGn√§digste Komtesse lesen ja in meinem Herzen¬†...,
Sie werden ja selbst wissen.¬´

¬ªDu Schwein, du miserables¬†...¬´, donnerte ihn Zenzi an, ¬ªDu hast an
meine Fut gedacht¬†..., an meine Brust¬†..., du Hurenkerl¬†...,
gesteh¬†...¬´

¬ªIch gestehe¬†...¬´, sagte er tonlos.

¬ªUnd du hast gedacht¬†..., du Mistkerl¬†...¬´, fuhr sie in demselben Ton
fort¬†..., ¬ªda√ü du auf mir liegen willst¬†..., was? Du Lausbub¬†..., und
da√ü ich die F√º√üe auseinander geb', und da√ü du mir den Schwanz
hineinsteckst¬†..., du Schuft du¬†..., du hast gedacht, da√ü du mich
puderst¬†..., du Saukerl¬†..., und da√ü du mit meinen Duteln spielst¬†...,
willst du gestehen, ... du elender Fallott¬†...?¬´

Er faltete bittend die H√§nde: ¬ªJa, gn√§digste Komtesse¬†..., ich
gestehe¬†..., ich gestehe alles¬†...¬´

¬ªUnd sch√§mst du dich nicht vor der Prinzessin da?¬´ Zenzi zeigte mit
ausgestreckter Hand auf mich. Ich war von allem, was ich h√∂rte und sah
so stuff, da√ü es mir gar nicht auffiel, als Zenzi mich eine Prinzessin
nannte.

¬ªJa, ich sch√§me mich¬†...¬´, rief er leise und hob auch zu mir seine
H√§nde.

¬ªKnie nieder¬†...¬´, befahl Zenzi.

Er warf sich sofort auf die Knie: ¬ªIch bitte, verzeihen Sie mir,
gn√§digste Komtesse¬´, ... flehte er inbr√ºnstig, und zu mir gewendet bat
er: ¬ªAuch Sie, erhabene Prinzessin, bitte ich um Verzeihung¬†...¬´

¬ªNein¬†...¬´, fauchte Zenzi, ¬ªkeine Verzeihung¬†..., erst die Strafe¬†...¬´

Er wurde von einer leichten R√∂te √ºberflogen. ¬ªJa¬†...¬´, stotterte er
schnell, ¬ªerst die Strafe¬†...¬´

¬ªZieh dich aus!¬´ rief Zenzi.

Er legte sofort alle Kleider ab, und stand nackt vor uns. Sein K√∂rper
war au√üerordentlich wei√ü und zart. Bebend stand er da, mit gesenktem
Haupt, und schaute Zenzi an, wie ein gepeitschter Hund.

Er stellte sich gehorsam zwischen Sofa und Kasten.

Zenzi begann sich zu entkleiden und auf einen Wink von ihr tat ich
dasselbe.

¬ªNa wart¬†..., du Gauner¬†...¬´, redete sie dabei, ¬ªdu wirst uns sehen¬†...,
alles¬†..., aber kriegen tust du nichts¬†..., mich und die Prinzessin mu√üt
du anschauen¬†..., aber nicht r√ºhren¬†...¬´

Sie trat nackt auf ihn zu, mit ihren hochaufgerichteten Br√ºsten, mit
zur√ºckgeworfenem Kopf, ihre Augen funkelten, ihre Lippen zitterten. Sie
war selbst aufgeregt.

Sie rieb ihm ihre Br√ºste an den Leib, rieb ihren Scho√ü gegen den
seinigen. Dann mu√üte ich dazu treten und dasselbe tun. Er schaute uns
traurig an, lie√ü die Arme h√§ngen, und r√ºhrte sich nicht. Mich durchfuhr
es wie ein elektrischer Funke, als ich meine Br√ºste gegen seine Brust
wetzte. Sein Leib war brennend hei√ü wie Feuer und f√ºhlte sich zart an,
wie Samt. Und als ich meinen Venusberg gegen seine Haare rieb, bemerkte
ich, da√ü seine Lanze tr√ºbselig herunterhing.

Was f√ºr Geschichten, dachte ich bei mir, wann wird das aufh√∂ren, damit
er endlich dazu kommt uns zu v√∂geln? Denn auch in mir hatte sich die
Geilheit schon geregt.

Zenzi zog mich von ihm fort. ¬ªJetzt kommt die Strafe¬†..., du
Schwein¬†...¬´, drohte sie.

Er verfolgte sie mit gierigen Blicken. Sie ging zum Kasten und holte
zwei Ruten herunter.

¬ªKennst du das, du verdammter Satan¬†...?¬´ fragte sie, die Ruten
schwingend.

¬ªJa, ich kenne das, gn√§digste Komtesse¬†...¬´, rief er schluckend.

¬ªWei√üt du, was jetzt geschieht¬†..., du Hurenbankert¬†...?¬´

¬ªJetzt kommt die Strafe, gn√§digste Komtesse¬†...¬´, entgegnete er
schweratmend. ¬ªStrafen Sie mich, Komtesse¬†..., ich verdiene es¬†..., und
auch Sie, erhabene Prinzessin¬†...¬´, wandte er sich zu mir, ¬ªstrafen auch
Sie mich¬†...¬´ Zenzi gab mir eine Rute: ¬ªHau fest zu¬´, fl√ºsterte sie
rasch. ¬ªFest¬†...¬´

¬ªHeraus aus dem Winkel¬†..., du Dieb¬†...¬´, fuhr sie ihn an.

Er n√§herte sich ihr.

Klatsch! Im Nu hatte sie ihm mit der Rute eins quer √ºber die Brust
versetzt, da√ü ein dicker Streifen, wie ein rotes Band sichtbar wurde. Er
zuckte zusammen, und ich sah, wie sein Schweif mit einem Ruck sich
aufrichtete.

¬ªSp√ºrst du das, du Gauner, du R√§uber, du Futschlecker¬†..., du
Laustanz¬†..., du Beutel¬†..., du Dreckfink¬†..., du Vagabund¬†..., sp√ºrst
du das¬†...?¬´ Zenzi schlug drauf los und mit jedem Hieb kam ein neuer
Schimpfname, mit jedem Hieb wurden Brust und Bauch r√∂ter.

¬ªJa¬†..., ich sp√ºr' es¬†..., gn√§digste Komtesse¬†...¬´, r√∂chelte er, ¬ªich
danke ... f√ºr die Strafe¬†..., ich danke¬†..., fester¬†..., bitte¬†...,
z√ºchtigen Sie mich fester ... Aber die Prinzessin auch¬†..., warum
z√ºchtigt mich die Prinzessin nicht¬†...?¬´

¬ªHau zu!¬´ schrie mich Zenzi an, und hob gegen mich die Rute. Ich
erschrak und gab ihm einen sanften Streich √ºber den R√ºcken. Seine Haut
zuckte, aber er wimmerte: ¬ªAch, ich bitte, die erhabene Prinzessin¬†...,
sie will mich nicht strafen¬†..., ich sp√ºr' gar nichts¬†..., ich bitte
Prinzessin¬†..., ich wei√ü¬†..., ich bin unw√ºrdig¬†..., aber ich bitte um
meine Strafe¬†..., fester¬†...¬´

Ich schlug st√§rker zu, und bemerkte, da√ü es mir Vergn√ºgen machte.

¬ªDanke¬†..., danke¬†..., danke¬†...¬´, stammelte er.

¬ªMaul halten¬†...¬´, kommandierte Zenzi, ¬ªoder ich hau dir das Beuschel
aus dem Leib.¬´

Wir schlugen jetzt im Takt. Zenzi vorn auf seine Brust und auf seine
Schenkel, ich von hinten auf seinen R√ºcken und auf seinen Arsch, der
bald rot angelaufen war, und je mehr wir schlugen, desto aufgeregter
wurden wir, desto mehr Freude machte es uns, und desto besser zielten
wir.

Er stand zitternd da und redete: ¬ªVerzeihung¬†..., Verzeihung¬†..., ich
will nicht mehr an ihre sch√∂nen Duteln¬†..., denken¬†..., nein¬†...,
ach¬†..., ach¬†..., Verzeihung Prinzessin¬†..., Ihre Br√ºste sind so sch√∂n
und hart¬†..., aber ich will's nicht mehr tun¬†..., o¬†..., welche
Qualen¬†..., welche Schmerzen¬†..., ich will nicht mehr an Ihre Fut
denken¬†..., Komtesse¬†..., ich hab' davon getr√§umt¬†..., da√ü ich Ihnen das
Jungfernh√§utel zerrissen hab'¬†..., gn√§digste Komtesse¬†..., aber ich
wei√ü¬†..., man darf das nicht¬†..., und Sie Prinzessin¬†..., ich hab' mir
vorgestellt¬†..., da√ü ich Sie gev√∂gelt hab'¬†..., aber ich wei√ü¬†..., das
darf nicht sein¬†..., Verzeihung¬†...¬´

¬ªNiederknien¬´, gebot ihm Zenzi.

Er warf sich auf die Knie. ¬ªDa lieg' ich¬†..., im Staube vor Ihnen¬†...,
Angebetete¬†..., zertreten Sie mich¬†..., ich sterbe¬†..., in Demut¬†...¬´

¬ªDu darfst mir die F√º√üe k√ºssen. Hundskerl¬†...¬´, knurrte Zenzi. Ich h√∂rte
zu schlagen auf. Er beugte sich herab und bedeckte ihre F√º√üe mit
gl√ºhenden K√ºssen. Dabei schmitzte ihn Zenzi auf seinen jetzt empor
stehenden Popo, da√ü es nur so pfiff.

Er st√∂hnte und gurgelte: ¬ªAch Komtesse¬†..., zu Ihren F√º√üen¬†..., Ihr
Hund¬†..., Ihr Sklave¬†...¬´

¬ªK√º√ü die Fut¬†..., du hast sie beleidigt¬†...¬´, herrschte ihn Zenzi an.

Er richtete sich in den Knien auf und begrub seinen Kopf in Zenzis
Scho√ü.

¬ªSaukerl¬†..., Zuchth√§usler¬†..., Taschendieb¬†..., Galgenstrick¬†...,
Strizzi¬†...¬´, schimpfte sie und bearbeitete dabei seine Schultern mit
ihrer Rute.

¬ªWird mir¬†..., die Prinzessin¬†..., auch erlauben¬†...¬´

¬ªErst sch√∂n bitten¬†...¬´, gebot Zenzi.

Er drehte sich zu mir, faltete kniend die H√§nde und fl√ºsterte:
¬ªBitte¬†..., bitte¬†..., erhabene Prinzessin¬†...¬´

¬ªSch√∂n aufwarten¬†...¬´, verlangte Zenzi.

Er wartete auf, wie ein H√ºndchen, und mich wollte ein pl√∂tzliches Lachen
√ºberkommen, aber ein Blick von Zenzi scheuchte es fort.

¬ªNun zu ihr¬†...¬´, befahl sie und gab ihm einen Sto√ü.

Er kam auf seinen Knien zu mir herangerutscht.

Wie er meine F√º√üe mit seinen K√ºssen ber√ºhrte, und ich seine pickenden,
hei√üen Lippen auf meiner Haut f√ºhlte, fuhr es mir bis in die Muschel,
und ich drosch auf den Hintern von ihm, der in die H√∂he gerichtet war,
los, als sei er von Holz. Kleine, hellrote Blutstropfen sickerten aus
seiner blauangelaufenen Haut hervor. Ich drosch weiter, von seinen
Lippen gekitzelt.

¬ªErhabene Prinzessin¬†...¬´, fl√ºsterte er, ¬ªnie wieder soll die
Niedertracht, die in mir steckt¬†..., Sie beleidigen¬†..., strafen Sie
mich nur¬†..., o Prinzessin¬†..., Sie sind grausam¬†..., grausam¬†..., aber
gerecht¬†..., ich leide gern¬†..., ich hab' es verdient.¬´

¬ªDie Fut¬†...¬´, schrie ihm Zenzi zu.

Er richtete sich auf, und pre√üte sein Gesicht in meine Schamhaare.
Seine Lippen k√º√üten jede Stelle. Und jeder Ku√ü ging mir mitten durchs
Herz, denn ich hatte schon keinen anderen Gedanken, als mich hinzuwerfen
und ordentlich behandelt zu werden. Wie er den Kopf senkte und auch
meine Muschel erreichte, trat ich ein wenig mit den F√º√üen auseinander,
damit er besser hinein k√∂nne. Aber er k√º√üte nur mit den Lippen. Mit der
Zunge tat er gar nichts. Und diese hei√üen K√ºsse machten mich noch viel
geiler, als wenn er mich geschleckt h√§tte. Ich h√∂rte zu schlagen auf,
weil ich mit mir selbst besch√§ftigt war.

Augenblicklich lie√ü er von mir ab. Zenzi n√§herte sich ihm: ¬ªAuf!¬´ gebot
sie. Er stand auf.

¬ªMachen Sie ein Ende¬†..., gn√§digste Komtesse¬†..., machen Sie meiner Qual
ein Ende¬†..., Sie Grausame¬†...¬´, flehte er sie an.

¬ªGut¬´, sagte sie eifrig, ¬ªich will es tun. Wer soll vorn sein? Die
Prinzessin oder ich¬†...?¬´

¬ªBitte¬†..., die Prinzessin¬†...¬´, bat er, ¬ªwenn sie mir die Gnade
erweisen will, die Prinzessin.¬´

¬ªAlso schau her¬´, unterwies mich Zenzi, ¬ªdu nimmst seinen Beutel so¬†...¬´
Sie stellte sich vor ihm auf und nahm seinen Hodensack in die Hand, ¬ªund
dann dr√ºckst du ihn fest¬†..., aber nicht auf die Eier, sondern da¬†...¬´
Sie zeigte mir die Stelle, hinter den Eiern, wo der ganze Sack sich
fassen und zuschlie√üen l√§√üt. ¬ªUnd mit der andern Hand haust du ihn auf
die F√º√ü', auf die Schenkel, wo du halt hinkommst.¬´ Ich befolgte ihren
Rat. Er stand aufrecht da, die H√§nde √ºber der Brust gefaltet und ich
nahm seinen Beutel fest in die Linke, und schn√ºrte ihn ab, da√ü mir die
Finger weh taten. Sein Schwanz stieg noch steifer in die H√∂he und
schwankte hin und her, wie ein Rohr im Winde.

Mit der andern Hand schlug ich zu, und von r√ºckw√§rts bearbeitete ihn
Zenzi wie rasend. Hageldicht fielen ihre Streiche und sein Hinterer
bebte jedesmal nach vorn, da√ü es zu f√ºhlen war, und seinem Schweif
jedesmal einen Rucker gab.

Der junge Mann schluchzte und schrie, und stammelte dazwischen, und auf
einmal schleuderte er seinen Samen aus. Es kam so unvermutet, da√ü mir
der wei√üe Saft direkt ins Gesicht flog.

¬ªO Prinzessin¬´, rief er dabei, ¬ªo gn√§digste Komtesse¬†...¬´

Zenzi trischakte auf seinen Hintern los, als sie sah, da√ü er vorne
spritzte. Wie aber der letzte Tropfen aus ihm herausgeklopft war, warf
sie die Rute weg und ging zum Sofa, um sich hinzusetzen. Ich blieb auf
dem Boden hocken, wie ich war, trocknete mir das Gesicht ab, und
schaute, was er nun beginnen werde.

Noch immer glaubte ich, dieser sonderbare Mensch werde Zenzi oder mich
v√∂geln. Er stand eine Weile ganz in sich versunken da, dann raffte er
sich auf, und kleidete sich an. Hastig, ohne uns anzusehen, scheu, mit
einem erm√ºdeten traurigen Gesicht. Wie er fertig war, ging er in den
√§u√üersten Winkel des Zimmers, wo ein wackliger Stuhl stand, dort machte
er sich irgendwas zu schaffen, dann rannte er f√∂rmlich hinaus, ohne uns
eines Blickes zu w√ºrdigen.

Kaum hatte er die T√ºre hinter sich geschlossen, als Zenzi aufsprang und
mit einem Satz in den Winkel sprang. Dort lagen auf dem Stuhl zwei
Zehner. Sie raffte sie zusammen, hielt in jeder Hand einen hoch, tanzte
im Zimmer damit herum und gab mir zuletzt den einen.

¬ªWas¬†...? Das ist fein?¬´ meinte sie, und ich, ganz perplex, war
vollkommen ihrer Meinung.

Denselben Nachmittag noch ging mir ein Mann in einem Samtanzug nach. Er
sah aus wie ein Italiener, hatte schwarze Augen, und wie es damals
besonders bei Italienern und Franzosen √ºblich war, einen schwarzen
Ziegenbart. Ich bog in die Seitenstra√üe ein, denn es war am Graben und
erst zwei Uhr Mittag. In dem schon erw√§hnten Haustor wartete ich auf
ihn. Er kam herein und nahm mich im finstern Torwinkel sogleich bei der
Brust, die er aber mehr so abgriff, als untersuche er mich, als um zu
spielen.

¬ªNa, was ist?¬´ fragte er.

Das fragten so ziemlich alle. Und ich sagte darauf: ¬ªSoll ich
vorausgehen? Es ist nicht weit.¬´

¬ªWo?¬´ fragte er.

¬ªIn der Sch√∂nlaterngasse¬†...¬´

¬ªNein¬†...¬´, meinte er, ¬ªich will gar nicht zu dir kommen¬†...¬´

¬ªGut¬´, sagte ich l√§chelnd, denn auch darauf war ich vorbereitet,
¬ªbleiben wir da¬†...¬´

¬ªDa?¬´ Er war erstaunt.

¬ªO ja¬´, beruhigte ich ihn, ¬ªauf der Stiege ... da wohnt niemand¬†..., da
k√∂nnen wir alles tun¬†...¬´

Er wollte auch das nicht. ¬ªKomm zu mir¬´, ... verlangte er.

¬ªIst es weit?¬´ Ich zeigte Mi√ütrauen. ¬ªO nein¬†..., aber wir fahren mit
dem Komfortabel hin¬†...¬´

¬ªWas krieg' ich denn?¬´ wollte ich wissen.

¬ªSei nur ruhig¬†...¬´, entgegnete er gro√üartig, ¬ªdu wirst reichlich
bezahlt werden¬†...¬´ Und weil ich z√∂gerte, f√ºgte er hinzu: ¬ªSo gut, wie
noch nie¬†..., ich zahl' besser als jeder andere¬†...¬´

Er imponierte mir und fl√∂√üte mir Vertrauen ein: ¬ªGut¬´, sagte ich, ¬ªaber
Sie m√ºssen mir das Geld voraus geben¬†...¬´

¬ªZu Haus¬†...¬´, dr√§ngte er, ¬ªzu Haus kriegst du das Geld, wenn wir zur
T√ºr hineinkommen.¬´

Wir verlie√üen das Tor gemeinsam, und er rief, als wir durch ein paar
Gassen gegangen waren, einen Komfortabel herbei. Wir stiegen ein und als
wir losfuhren, fragte er: ¬ªDu glaubst gewi√ü, ich will dich v√∂geln?¬´

Ich l√§chelte ihn kokett an: ¬ªWas denn sonst?¬´

¬ªIch will ganz was anderes¬†...¬´, sagte er geheimnisvoll.

Ich mu√üte wieder l√§cheln; und wollte klug sein: ¬ªAha¬†..., ich wei√ü
schon¬´, sagte ich.

¬ªNa was denn?¬´ neckte er.

¬ªVielleicht in den Mund¬†...?¬´ riet ich.

¬ªNein¬†...¬´, er lachte. ¬ªWas glaubst?¬´

¬ªVon hinten¬†...?¬´ riet ich weiter.

Er sch√ºttelte den Kopf.

Ich dachte, er werde sich so behandeln lassen wie der junge Mann, den
wir mit Ruten gestrichen hatten.

¬ªWollen Sie sich schlagen lassen?¬´ riet ich wieder.

¬ªHerrgott, du kennst dich aber aus¬´, meinte er, ¬ªnein, auch das
nicht¬†...¬´

¬ªJa, dann wei√ü ich nicht¬†...¬´, ich gab es auf.

¬ªPhotographieren will ich dich¬†...¬´, sagte er.

¬ªPhoto¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa, nackt photographieren, in allen m√∂glichen Stellungen.¬´

Ich lachte. Ich war noch nie photographiert worden und glaubte, ich
bek√§me dann sch√∂ne Bilder von mir.

Wir kamen zu ihm. In einem neuen Vorstadthaus, tief in einem alten
Garten versteckt, wohnte er. Vorne stand das Zinshaus, dann kam man
durch den Hof, dann durch den alten Garten zu dem kleinen Haus, in dem
er ein paar Zimmer und ein Atelier hatte.

Eine kleine dicke Frau empfing uns. Sie war blond, hatte eine gedrungene
Gestalt, die in einem roten Schlafrock noch fetter aussah. Ihre Augen
schienen mir unterkohlt zu sein. Sie sah mich gr√º√üend an und meinte:
¬ªDie wird gerad recht sein¬†...¬´

Der Photograph sagte: ¬ªTummeln wir uns, damit wir das Licht ben√ºtzen.¬´

Sie sagte: ¬ªSoll ich den Albert holen?¬´

Er: ¬ªAber nat√ºrlich, wir k√∂nnen ja absolut nichts anfangen ohne ihn.¬´

Sie wollte fort, aber er hielt sie auf:

¬ªWarte, ich hol' ihn selbst. Tut's euch lieber derweil herrichten.¬´
Damit entfernte er sich durch den Garten. Die Frau sah ihm nach und
meinte: ¬ªJetzt f√ºrchtet er sich schon wieder, ich k√∂nnt' mit dem Albert
allein sein.¬´

Dann f√ºhrte sie mich ins Haus, direkt in das Atelier, das mir mit seinem
Glasplafond und seinen hohen Fenstern sehr gut gefiel. Sie √∂ffnete eine
Tapetent√ºr, nachdem sie einen Schrank, der sie verborgen hielt,
weggeschoben hatte. Wir traten in eine Kammer, in der nur ein kleines,
hoch angebrachtes Fenster Licht einlie√ü.

¬ªZiehn Sie sich aus¬†...¬´, sagte sie zu mir.

Zu meinem Erstaunen aber begann auch sie ihren Schlafrock abzustreifen.

¬ªSie m√ºssen alles ausziehen¬´, meinte sie, ¬ªnur die Str√ºmpfe und die
Schuhe k√∂nnen Sie anbehalten.¬´

Sie stand im Hemd vor mir und wartete, bis ich ganz blo√ü war. Dann kam
sie dicht zu mir heran und musterte mich.

¬ªWie alt bist du denn?¬´ Sie duzte mich auf einmal. ¬ªVierzehn¬†...?¬´

¬ªNoch nicht¬´, gab ich Bescheid.

¬ªHat dir mein Mann schon gesagt, was er mit dir machen will¬†...?¬´

¬ªJa¬†...¬´

¬ªNa also¬†...¬´, meinte sie und streifte ihr Hemd ab. ¬ªDas √ºbrige wirst du
schon sehen.¬´

¬ªWird er Sie auch photographieren?¬´ fragte ich erstaunt.

Sie lachte: ¬ªNat√ºrlich¬†..., bis jetzt hat er √ºberhaupt nur mich
photographiert, weil wir noch kein anderes Frauenzimmer aufgetrieben
haben. Denn erstens ist es viel zu gef√§hrlich und zweitens waren alle zu
teuer¬†...¬´

¬ªWas krieg' ich denn?¬´ erkundigte ich mich.

¬ªSei nur ruhig¬†...¬´, vertr√∂stete sie, ¬ªdu wirst zufrieden sein.¬´

Ihr gutm√ºtiger freundlicher Ton gefiel mir.

¬ªIch bin ja ruhig¬´, sagte ich l√§chelnd.

¬ªEr h√§tt' sicher keine andere genommen¬´, erz√§hlte sie redselig, ¬ªaber er
hat eine Bestellung, zu der braucht er ein junges Ding, wie du eins
bist¬†...¬´

¬ªSie sind ja auch noch jung¬†...¬´ Ich meinte ihr dieses Kompliment machen
zu m√ºssen.

¬ªO ja¬†...¬´, lachte sie, ¬ªda schau¬†..., hier so eine gro√üe Brust, steht
sie noch fest genug, was?¬´

Sie nahm ihre Br√ºste und wog sie in den H√§nden. Sie waren breit und fest
und standen so stark zur Seite, da√ü man glauben konnte, die beiden
Himbeeren wollten zwischen den Armen durch nach r√ºckw√§rts schauen, wer
wohl von hinten k√§me.

¬ªSch√∂n sind sie¬†...¬´, sagte ich anerkennend.

¬ªGreif her¬†...¬´, lud sie mich ein.

Ich mu√üte ihren Busen in die Hand nehmen, er war wirklich hart und
elastisch.

¬ªNur der Bauch ist ein bissel dick¬†...¬´, sagte sie.

¬ªO nein¬´, beruhigte ich sie.

¬ªUnd die Schenkel¬†...¬´ Sie klatschte sich aufs Fleisch und lachte. ¬ªWenn
mich der Albert sieht¬´, fuhr sie fort, ¬ªwird er gleich geil.¬´

¬ªDas glaub' ich¬†...¬´

¬ªAber mein Mann √§rgert sich¬†...¬´, lachte sie. ¬ªJa was w√§r's denn, wenn
er ihm nicht stehen m√∂cht'¬†...? Da k√∂nnt' er uns doch gar nicht
photographieren?¬´

Nach diesen Worten begann ich doch zu ahnen, was hier vor sich gehen
sollte. Gleich darauf kam der Mann zur√ºck, und rief uns heraus. Wir
traten in das Atelier und da war noch ein Bursch von etwa achtzehn
Jahren. Er mochte Laufbursche, Stallpage, oder so etwas dergleichen
sein. Denn er hatte ein sonnverbranntes und verfrorenes Gesicht mit
kleinen dicken Ohren und einer roten, ziemlich dicken Nase. Er war
schlank, aber kr√§ftig und im ganzen nicht schlecht gekleidet. Mir
wenigstens gefiel er ganz gut.

Der Herr Capuzzi, so hie√ü der Photograph, schickte den Burschen, in dem
ich den herbeigerufenen Albert erkannte, sogleich in das Ankleidezimmer.

¬ªTummel dich¬´, rief er ihm nach, dann begann er mich zu mustern.

¬ªIst gar nicht schlecht¬†...¬´, meinte er zu seiner Frau, ¬ªhe?¬´

¬ªJa¬´, antwortete sie ihm ernst, ¬ªes ist gerade das was du brauchst¬†...¬´

¬ªWie die Duterln noch ganz hoch sitzen¬´, meinte er.

¬ªSie sind noch nicht ganz herau√üen¬†...¬´, erkl√§rte die Frau.

¬ªUnd gar keine H√ºften noch¬´, konstatierte Capuzzi.

¬ªAuch noch so wenig Haare¬†...¬´, zeigte ihm die Frau, auf meine Muschel
deutend.

Sie waren zufrieden mit mir und Capuzzi versprach, da√ü ich es auch sein
solle. Er richtete seine photographischen Apparate, fuhr mit dem Kopf
unter das schwarze Tuch, und ich sah ihm gespannt zu.

Inzwischen kam Albert aus dem Zimmer, und war nackt. Er l√§chelte mich
an, weil ich wie gebannt auf sein Bajonett schaute, das er schon
aufgepflanzt vor sich hertrug.

Frau Capuzzi lachte hell auf und rief: ¬ªEr steht ihm richtig schon
wieder¬†...¬´

Capuzzi knurrte: ¬ªSei ruhig¬†...¬´

Albert war sehr sch√∂n gebaut. Ich bewunderte seine gew√∂lbte Brust, den
eingezogenen Bauch, die von Muskeln geschwellten Arme und Schenkel, und
vor allem den dicken geraden Solomuskel, der aus seinen Bauchhaaren
emporstieg.

Capuzzi sagte: ¬ªAlso fangen wir an.¬´

Er schob eine kleine, teppichbehangene Bank ohne Lehne herbei und
meinte: ¬ªZuerst also du, Melanie, Albert und du -- wie hei√üt du?¬´ setzte
er zu mir gewendet hinzu.

¬ªPeperl¬´, sagte ich.

¬ªAlso Peperl¬†..., Albert setz dich in die Mitte¬†...¬´

Er tat es.

¬ªSo¬†..., jetzt Melanie rechts zu ihm, und Pepi links zu ihm¬†...¬´

Wir beeilten uns.

¬ªSo, und jetzt nimmt jede den Schweif in die Hand¬†...¬´

Wir griffen zu.

¬ªAlbert¬†...¬´, rief Capuzzi. ¬ªSie m√ºssen aber auch etwas tun ... Geben
Sie die beiden Arme um die Schulter¬†..., still¬†..., einen Moment¬†...¬´

Er verschwand hinter dem schwarzen Tuch:

¬ªSo¬†...¬´, rief er hervor, ¬ªnicht bewegen. Melanie schau den Albert
an¬†..., du Pepi auch¬†..., und du Albert schau in die H√∂h'¬†..., verdreh
die Augen¬†...¬´

Wir befolgten seinen Befehl. Alberts Schweif, von unseren beiden H√§nden
umklammert, sah nur noch mit dem Spitzel hervor.

¬ªEins¬†..., zwei¬†..., drei¬†..., vier¬†..., f√ºnf¬†..., sechs¬†...¬´, z√§hlte
Capuzzi. ¬ªFertig.¬´

Wir sprangen auf.

¬ªEine neue Stellung¬´, befahl er.

¬ªWas f√ºr eine¬†...?¬´ fragte die Frau.

¬ªLeg dich nieder, Albert¬†...¬´, befahl Capuzzi.

Albert legte sich auf die schmale Bank, seine F√º√üe hingen vom Knie an
herab.

¬ªMelanie¬†..., stell dich dr√ºber¬†...¬´

Die Frau bekam rechts und links einen Polster, auf den sie steigen
konnte.

¬ªBeug dich √ºber ihn¬†...¬´, rief Capuzzi.

¬ªDas haben wir ja schon oft gehabt¬´, rief die Frau.

¬ªSo nicht¬†..., wirst schon sehen¬†...¬´, wandte er ein.

Sie beugte sich vor, st√ºtzte die Arme auf und ihre Br√ºste hingen gerade
√ºber Alberts Gesicht.

¬ªAlbert, nimm die Brust in die Hand¬†...¬´, sagte Capuzzi. Albert ergriff
die beiden runden Dinger und begann an den Warzen zu spielen.

¬ªEr regt mich schon wieder auf¬†...¬´ rief Frau Capuzzi.

¬ªAlbert¬†...¬´, schrie der Photograph, ¬ªruhig mit der Hand, sonst werd'
ich dir helfen.¬´

Er hielt die Br√ºste ruhig in seiner Hand. Aber jetzt war es Melanie, die
sich schaukelte und so ihre Duteln an Alberts H√§nden rieb.

¬ªDa schauen S'¬´, sagte Albert, ¬ªjetzt spielen Sie ja selber¬†...¬´

¬ªMelanie!¬´ Der Photograph sagte es im vorwurfsvollen Tone.

¬ªNa ja¬†...¬´, meinte sie, ¬ªwenn ich jetzt schon aufgeregt bin.¬´

¬ªPeperl¬†...¬´, wandte er sich zu mir, ¬ªnimm jetzt den Schweif und steck
ihn hinein¬†..., la√ü aber die Hand nicht los.¬´

Ich ergriff Alberts Flaggenstange und richtete sie auf. Mit der anderen
Hand suchte ich den Eingang von Melanie. Aber sie kam mir zuvor, griff
hin, und steckte sich den Pfropfen selbst ins Spundloch.

¬ªAch¬†...¬´, seufzte sie dabei¬†..., ¬ªach¬†..., die Qu√§lerei geht schon
wieder an¬†...¬´

¬ªNicht so tief, Melanie¬´, ermahnte ihr Mann, man mu√ü die Hand von der
Peperl sehen¬†...¬´

¬ªVielleicht so?¬´ fragte sie, hob den Popo, da√ü der Schweif nur mehr bis
zur Eichel drin war.

¬ªSo ist's recht¬†...¬´, stimmte er bei.

¬ªAber nein¬´, rief sie, ¬ªso kommt er mir ja aus¬´, und wieder senkte sie
ihren Helm √ºber dieses Haupt tief hinab.

¬ªNichts¬†...¬´, br√ºllte ihr Mann, ¬ªh√∂her¬†..., zum Teufel¬†...¬´ Sie zog sich
zur√ºck und sagte: ¬ªMeinetwegen¬†..., aber ich glaube, so w√§r's auch ganz
sch√∂n¬†...¬´, und wieder stie√ü sie sich ihn herein.

Der Mann sprang herzu und hieb ihr eins √ºber das Ges√§√ü, da√ü es nur so
klatschte. ¬ªDu v√∂gelst ja, du Luder¬†...¬´, schrie er sie an, ¬ªaber mich
betr√ºgst du nicht¬†...¬´

¬ªDas ist auch gev√∂gelt¬†...¬´, antwortete sie gereizt, ¬ªsobald er nur drin
steckt¬†..., ist es gev√∂gelt¬†...!¬´

¬ªNein¬´, ereiferte er sich, ¬ªwie oft habe ich dir das schon erkl√§rt¬†...,
da√ü wir nur Stellungen¬†..., das nennt man nur markieren. Markieren ist
gestattet¬†..., aber nie werde ich erlauben, da√ü meine Frau sich von
einem anderen v√∂geln la√üt.¬´

Damals leuchtete diese bl√∂dsinnige Unterscheidung mir und allen
Beteiligten ein. Heute mu√ü ich √ºber den wunderbaren Ehemann l√§cheln.

Ich hielt Alberts Nagel und f√ºhlte, wie er pulsierte, und langsam fuhr
ich so hoch hinauf, da√ü ich mit der Hand auch die Muschelr√§nder von
Melanie ber√ºhrte, und da f√ºhlte ich, wie sie ihre Klappe jede Sekunde
zusammenzog, wodurch Albert nat√ºrlich sehr gereizt werden mu√üte.

¬ªDauert's noch lang?¬´ fragte Melanie.

¬ªNein¬†..., schau in den Apparat hinein¬†..., l√§chle¬†..., Pepi du
auch¬†..., so¬†..., eins¬†..., zwei¬†..., drei¬†..., vier¬†..., f√ºnf¬†...,
fertig!¬´

Melanie sprang von Albert hinunter. ¬ªGott sei Dank¬´, rief sie, ¬ªdas h√§lt
man ja nicht aus.¬´

Albert lag regungslos da.

¬ªJetzt umgekehrt¬†..., die Pepi hinauf¬†...¬´, befahl der Photograph.

Ich nahm die Stellung ein, die Melanie verlassen hatte.

¬ªMelanie¬†..., jetzt steckst du ihn der Peperl hinein¬†...¬´, befahl der
Mann.

¬ªSoll ich ihr die Brust anpacken¬†...?¬´ fragte Albert.

¬ªAber ja¬†..., was fragst denn noch?¬´ ermunterte der Photograph.

Albert legte seine H√§nde auf meine Brust. Wir l√§chelten uns an, und er
spielte sich damit.

Herr Capuzzi k√ºmmerte sich gar nicht darum.

Da f√ºhrte mir seine Frau den Stachel ein.

Albert und ich l√§chelten uns verst√§ndnisvoll an, dann fing er an zu
sto√üen und ich flog auf und nieder, so da√ü Melanie ihre Hand fortziehen
mu√üte. Sie g√∂nnte uns aber die Sache nicht, sondern rief gleich: ¬ªDa
sagst du nix¬†..., was? Die d√ºrfen machen was sie wollen¬†...¬´

¬ªRuhig, Kinder¬†...¬´, gebot uns Capuzzi, und z√§hlte wieder: ¬ªEins, zwei,
drei, vier.¬´

Wir verhielten uns ruhig. Melanie griff wieder an Alberts Schweif, da√ü
es aussah, als leiste sie uns Beihilfe.

¬ªFertig¬´, meldete Capuzzi.

Jetzt legten wir wieder los und v√∂gelten. Aber Melanie wurde b√∂se:
¬ªAlbert¬†...¬´, schrie sie ihn an, ¬ªwirst du aufh√∂ren¬†...¬´

¬ªWirst du aufh√∂ren¬†...¬´, br√ºllte mir Capuzzi zu. Und weil das nichts
half, ri√ü er mich von meinem guten Platz herunter.

¬ªDas verbitt' ich mir¬´, sagte er, ¬ªdas k√∂nnts ihr sp√§ter tun¬†..., wenn
ihr wollt.¬´

Er begann eine neue Gruppe zu bauen, wie er sich ausdr√ºckte.

Albert mu√üte auf seiner Bank liegenbleiben. Melanie kniete vor ihm und
nahm seinen Schwanz in den Mund.

¬ªNur das Spitzel¬†...¬´, sagte Capuzzi, ¬ªnur markieren¬†...¬´

Ich stellte mich √ºber seinen Kopf und reichte meinen Freudenkelch seinen
Lippen dar. Albert schlug mit seiner Zunge einen Triller an meinem
Kitzler, der mir bewies, da√ü er ein K√ºnstler war, und mich von Wonne
hin- und herwetzen lie√ü. Aber gleich darauf war er ruhig und markierte
nur.

Melanie machte mir Konkurrenz. Ich sah es an ihren Wangen und an dem
Zucken von Alberts Nudel, da√ü sie das St√ºckchen Mehlspeise, das ihr ihr
Mann g√∂nnte, heimlich mit ihrer Zunge streichelte. Sie schnaufte sehr,
und blinzelte zu ihrem Mann angstvoll hin√ºber. Als dieser hinter das
schwarze Tuch tauchte, ben√ºtzte sie die Gelegenheit, sich den Zapfen bis
auf den Grund zu bohren.

Gleich darauf hie√ü es wieder: ¬ªEins¬†..., zwei¬†...¬´, usw., dann: ¬ªFertig!¬´

Albert verabschiedete mich mit einem Zungentriller.

¬ªUmgekehrt¬´, befahl Capuzzi.

Ich war es jetzt, die auf Alberts Schweif kam, und ich nahm ihn bis ans
Heft in den Mund, wobei ich ihm so wohltat, da√ü er erkennen mu√üte, ich
verst√ºnde mich auf die Kunst der Zunge ebenso wie er.

Melanie hockte auf seinem Mund. Und ich konnte an Alberts Bewegungen
sehen, da√ü er nicht blo√ü markierte. Melanie hielt gewaltsam an sich, um
sich nicht zu bewegen. Dennoch sah ich, wie ihre Flanken bebten, wie sie
die Augen rollte, und wie sie sich fester und fester auf Albert
niederlie√ü.

¬ªMelanie¬´, rief ihr Mann, ¬ªdu k√∂nntest mit deinen Duteln spielen¬†...,
mach so, als ob du dir die Warzen k√ºssen wolltest.¬´

Sie hob ihre Br√ºste und senkte den Kopf und ben√ºtzte die Gelegenheit, um
ein bi√üchen hin- und herzuwetzen. Dabei mu√üte ihr Kitzler aus Alberts
Mund geglitten sein, denn es gab pl√∂tzlich einen schmatzenden Laut.

Capuzzi h√∂rte ihn, sprang hinzu und sagte w√ºtend: ¬ªAlbert, mir scheint,
du schleckst wirklich¬†...?¬´

¬ªAber nein¬†...¬´, gurgelte Albert unter seiner Last hervor.

¬ªIch rat' dir's nicht¬†...¬´, wiederholte Capuzzi, b√ºckte sich, und
trachtete herauszubekommen, wie sich Albert verhalte.

¬ªAber nix macht er¬´, rief Melanie unwirsch.

Capuzzi sah ihr ins Gesicht: ¬ªDu bist ja ganz aufgeregt¬†...¬´, sagte er
drohend.

¬ªNat√ºrlich¬´, versetzte sie, ¬ªich bin immer aufgeregt dabei¬†..., man ist
ja nicht von Holz. Tummel dich, da√ü wir fertig werden.¬´

W√§hrend Capuzzi aber zum Apparat zur√ºckging und unter das schwarze Tuch
schl√ºpfte, machte Melanie ein paar schnelle Wetzer, indem sie mir dabei
zutuschelte, und Albert schlug ihr seinen Zungenwirbel in ihre
Maultrommel. Capuzzi aber war rascher fertig als sie. ¬ªEins, zwei¬´,
klang es vom Apparat her und sein ¬ªFertig¬´ scheuchte uns auseinander.

¬ªWas jetzt¬´, fragte Melanie, die mit bebenden Br√ºsten und keuchendem
Atem dastand.

¬ªLeg du dich hin¬†...¬´, sagte ihr Mann.

Sie tat es sofort.

¬ªSo¬´, meinte er. ¬ªJetzt soll sich die Peperl dir am Mund setzen und der
Albert soll sich auf dich legen.¬´

¬ªNein¬´, protestierte sie, ¬ªich mag der ihre Fut nicht schlecken.¬´

¬ªDas brauchst du auch gar nicht¬†...¬´, erwiderte er, ¬ªdu sollst ja nur
markieren.¬´

¬ªAch was¬†..., ich mag's halt nicht beim Mund¬†...¬´, antwortete sie.

¬ªNa, soll sich die Pepi hinlegen¬†...¬´, schlug er vor, ¬ªund du gehst auf
sie.¬´

Aber sie wollte die Aussicht nicht aufgeben, seinen Schweif zu kriegen.
¬ªWei√üt was¬´, sagte sie, ¬ªdie Peperl k√∂nnt' mir ja am Busen spielen, das
sieht unschuldiger aus.¬´

Er war einverstanden.

Ich kniete neben ihr auf den Boden, nahm ihre Brust in beide H√§nde und
setzte meine Lippen auf ihre Himbeere. Was ich konnte, tat ich und ich
half ihr sogar zu einem kleinen Genu√ü. Von meinem Ku√ü angeregt, fing sie
zu zucken an, sie hupfte mit ihrem Popo in die H√∂he und stie√ü sich so
Alberts Balken ein paarmal tief in den Leib.

Mit einem Schritt war Capuzzi bei ihr und gab ihr eine Ohrfeige. ¬ªKannst
du das V√∂geln nicht lassen? Du Luder, du¬†...¬´, schrie er sie an.

¬ªIch mach' ja nix¬†...¬´, kreischte sie auf.

¬ªO ja¬´, sagte er w√ºtend, ¬ªimmer machst du's so¬†...¬´

¬ªDu grober Ding du¬†...¬´, jammerte sie, ¬ªdie Pepi suzelt mich an der
Brust und deshalb hab' ich so hupfen m√ºssen¬†...¬´

¬ªH√∂r zu suzeln auf¬†...¬´, befahl er mir, und zu seiner Frau gewendet
schimpfte er weiter: ¬ªDas sind Ausreden¬†..., immer probierst du, ob du
mit dem Albert nicht pudern kannst¬†..., ich wei√ü schon¬†...¬´

¬ªLa√ü mich gehen¬†...¬´, schalt sie, ¬ªes ist kein Wunder, da√ü man sich
r√ºhrt, wenn einem so ein dicker Schweif angesetzt wird¬†...¬´

¬ªNa, na¬†...¬´, meinte er, ¬ªdu wirst's erwarten k√∂nnen¬†..., ich mach'
dir's dann gleich.¬´

Damit verschwand er hinter seinem Tuch. Eins, zwei, und er war fertig.

¬ªSo¬´, meinte er, ¬ªich mu√ü in die Dunkelkammer¬†..., aber das sag' ich
dir¬†..., wenn du dich unterstehst und machst was¬†..., derschlag ich
dich¬†...¬´

Er ging in einen Nebenraum.

¬ªJesus¬†...¬´, seufzte Melanie, ¬ªdas ist mir eine Marter immer¬†...¬´

Albert meinte l√§chelnd: ¬ªIch h√§tt' auch nichts dagegen, wenn ich mir's
schon kommen lassen k√∂nnt.¬´

¬ªMein lieber, s√º√üer Albert¬†...¬´, fl√ºsterte sie, ¬ªm√∂chst du mich nicht
einmal pudern?¬´

¬ªO ja¬†...¬´, antwortete er, ¬ªsehr gern m√∂cht' ich's¬†..., aber es geht
nicht¬†...¬´

¬ªO Gott, o Gott¬´, jammerte sie zu mir, ¬ªdu glaubst gar nicht, wie gern
ich den Burschen hab'¬†..., du glaubst gar nicht, wie ich mir das
w√ºnsche, da√ü er mich einmal, ein einzigesmal v√∂geln m√∂cht'¬†...¬´

¬ªNa, warum tun Sie's denn nicht?¬´ fragte ich erstaunt.

¬ªEs geht ja nicht¬†...¬´, klagte sie.

¬ªJetzt¬´, schlug ich vor, ¬ªmachen Sie's g'schwind jetzt¬†...¬´

¬ªO je¬†...¬´, sie sch√ºttelte den Kopf, ¬ªdas m√∂cht' er ja gleich sehen¬†...¬´

¬ªWieso?¬´

Sie deutete auf die T√ºr, durch die Capuzzi verschwunden war.

¬ªDurch das gelbe Glas durch, da sieht er alles¬†...¬´

Ich bemerkte jetzt erst die kleine dunkle Scheibe, die in die T√ºr
eingelassen war.

¬ªDas ist es ja¬´, sagte sie tief bedauernd, ¬ªzwei Monate arbeiten wir
schon so¬†..., was Albertl¬†...? Seit zwei Monaten sp√ºr' ich seinen
Schweif¬†..., hab' ihn in der Hand und im Mund und zwischen der Brust,
und in der Fut, und im Arsch¬†..., und √ºberall¬†..., immer nur das
Spitzel¬†..., immer nur den Anfang¬†..., man m√∂cht' verr√ºckt werden¬†...¬´

Albert pflichtete ihr bei: ¬ªD√∂s ist nicht recht¬†..., wenn er nicht will,
da√ü ich seiner Frau was mach', soll er mir's nicht herlegen¬†...¬´

¬ªNat√ºrlich¬´, stimmte ich zu, ¬ªdas ist gemein¬†...¬´

¬ªNicht wahr¬†...¬´, meinte er. ¬ªNackend la√üt er mich's anschauen. Und bei
den Duteln la√üt er mich's nehmen¬†..., und die Fut kenn' ich schon so,
als h√§tt' ich's sechzigmal gefickt¬†..., und nie hab' ich was machen
d√ºrfen¬†..., das gibt's ja nicht¬†...¬´

¬ªWie hast du dir's denn kommen lassen?¬´ erkundigte ich mich.

Er wurde rot und schwieg.

¬ªG'wi√ü hast dir's selber herunterg'rissen¬†...?¬´

¬ªAh nein¬†...¬´, sagte er verlegen.

¬ªNa, wie denn?¬´ forschte ich weiter.

¬ªAuf italienisch¬†...¬´, sagte Melanie lachend.

¬ªWie ist das?¬´ fragte ich neugierig.

¬ªWirst es schon sehen¬†...¬´, sagte sie, ¬ªvielleicht photographiert ihn
mein Mann wieder einmal dabei¬†...¬´

Capuzzi kam heraus: ¬ªDie eine Stellung ist verpatzt¬´, sagte er, ¬ªdie mu√ü
noch einmal gemacht werden¬†...¬´

¬ªWelche denn?¬´

¬ªDie letzte¬†..., da bist du schuld¬†...¬´, knurrte er seine Frau an, ¬ªweil
du gewackelt hast¬†...¬´

Sie legte sich noch einmal hin. Albert steckte ihr nochmals seine
Schwanzspitze hinein. Ich nahm sie nochmals bei der Brust. Als er
¬ªFertig¬´ rief, begann er ungeniert zu remmeln. Nur drei, vier St√∂√üe,
aber sie waren so heftig, da√ü Melanie aufschrie: ¬ªJesus, Maria¬†...¬´

Capuzzi schleuderte ihn mit einem Griff weg, da√ü er beinahe umgefallen
w√§re. Aber Albert lachte verschmitzt. ¬ªIch v√∂gel' sie doch einmal¬†...¬´,
sagte er dabei.

¬ªNie¬´, schrie Capuzzi w√ºtend.

Melanie aber kreischte: ¬ªSo komm doch du wenigstens her¬†..., ich halt's
ja nicht aus.¬´

Capuzzi sch√§umte: ¬ªDa soll man arbeiten¬†..., und was
zusammenbringen¬†..., erst recht nicht¬†..., wart¬†...¬´

Melanie griff sich mit den Fingern an der Spalte herum: ¬ªKomm her¬†...,
komm her, oder ich ruf' den Albert¬†...¬´

¬ªSchaut's, da√ü ihr hinauskommt's¬†...¬´, herrschte Capuzzi mir und Albert
zu.

Wir lie√üen uns das nicht zweimal sagen, und schl√ºpften ins
Ankleidezimmer, wo wir uns gleich auf die Erde warfen.

¬ªAh¬†...¬´, sagte Albert, ¬ªich bin froh, da√ü du da bist¬†..., ich bin
froh¬†..., da kann ich wenigstens einmal ordentlich pudern¬†..., ah¬†...,
gib's her¬†..., da brauch' ich's mir nicht so kommen lassen¬†..., wie
sonst¬†..., ah¬†..., eine gute kleine Fotz hast du¬†..., so ist's gut¬†...,
r√ºhr' dich nur¬†..., wart¬†..., wart¬†..., die Dutel¬†..., so¬†..., ich k√ºss'
dir die Dutelwarzeln¬†..., fest¬†..., ja¬†...¬´

¬ªIch wart' auch schon die ganze Zeit darauf¬†...¬´, rief ich, ¬ªdas macht
mich so geil¬†..., das probieren¬†..., fester¬†..., ah¬†..., gut is dein
Schweif¬†..., so lang¬†..., und so warm¬†..., fester, ja ... spritz¬†...,
spritz nur¬†..., ah¬†..., wie wohl¬†..., noch? Ah¬†..., zweimal ist mir's
gekommen.¬´

Wie wir fertig waren, h√∂rten wir noch drinnen Capuzzi und Frau einander
bearbeiten. ¬ªNein¬†..., nein¬†...¬´, fl√ºsterte sie, ¬ª...¬†noch nicht
spritzen¬†..., noch nicht¬†..., ich hab' noch nicht genug¬†..., noch
mehr¬†..., gib mir mehr¬†...¬´

Er brummte: ¬ªWas¬†..., du m√∂chst aber doch lieber den Albert¬†..., was?¬´
-- ¬ªIch schei√ü' auf ihn¬†...¬´, quakte sie deutlich genug, ¬ªdu bist mir
der liebste¬†..., fick nur¬†..., gib mir deinen Mund¬†..., deine Zunge,
ach, ach¬†...¬´ Das andere war nur ein Ger√∂chel.

Dann fragte Herr Capuzzi wieder: ¬ªDarf ich jetzt spritzen¬†...? Du machst
mich so hin¬†..., ach¬†..., deine Br√ºste¬†..., kann ich jetzt?¬´

Und sie: ¬ªJa¬†..., spritz nur¬†..., jetzt¬†..., so¬†..., und jetzt kann der
Albert herumwetzen, wie viel er will¬†..., jetzt reizt er mich nicht
mehr¬†..., ah¬†..., ah¬†..., das ist s√º√ü¬†...¬´

¬ªWarum reizt er dich denn?¬´ fragte Capuzzi eifers√ºchtig.

Sie waren beide fertig und plauschten noch.

¬ªAber er reizt mich doch nicht¬´, beschwichtigte ihn seine Frau, ¬ªwenn er
mit seiner Nudel da ist, oder wenn ich ihn in den Mund nehm, oder wenn
er mich schleckt, dann denk' ich ja nur an dich¬†..., der Albert ist mir
wurscht¬†...¬´

Albert lachte: ¬ªSchmarn¬´, sagte er, ¬ªsie l√ºgt ihm ja was vor¬†..., du
hast ja genau geh√∂rt, wie sie auf mich geil ist¬†..., sie hat uns es ja
selbst gesagt¬†...¬´

¬ªFreilich¬´, best√§tigte ich ihm. ¬ªAber warum hast du sie nicht schon
l√§ngst einmal gepudert¬†..., das m√º√üte doch m√∂glich sein?¬´

¬ªEs ist unm√∂glich¬†...¬´, erkl√§rte Albert.

¬ªWarum¬†...?¬´

¬ªWeil der Kerl zu viel aufpa√üt¬†...¬´

¬ªAber wenn er nicht zu Haus ist¬†...?¬´ meinte ich.

¬ªAh was¬†...¬´, Albert sch√ºttelte den Kopf. ¬ªDer ist schlau, man wei√ü ja
nie, wo er ist¬†..., und jeden Augenblick kann er da sein.¬´

¬ªNa, und wenn schon¬†...¬´, lachte ich.

Albert wurde ernst: ¬ªDas ist nicht so¬†..., der derschlagt mich und
sie¬†..., das ist er imstand¬†..., der Katzelmacher, der! Der hat mehr
Kraft als ich¬†...¬´

¬ªAber geh¬´, meinte ich zweifelnd.

¬ªWart nur¬†...¬´, sagte Albert, ¬ªbis du den einmal nackend siehst¬†...¬´

¬ªWieso?¬´

¬ªNa¬´, erkl√§rte er mir, ¬ªmanchmal la√üt er sich von der Frau
photographieren.¬´

¬ªSo¬†...? Das sollt' er jetzt mit mir tun¬†...¬´, w√ºnschte ich.

¬ªWei√üt du¬†...¬´, fragte Albert, ¬ªwie oft der seine Frau v√∂gelt alle Tag?¬´

¬ªNa, wie oft denn?¬´

¬ªSo sieben- bis achtmal, meine Liebe¬†...¬´

¬ªDa k√∂nnt' sie wohl genug haben¬†...¬´, entschied ich.

¬ªFreilich¬´, meinte Albert, ¬ªaber er ist ihr schon zu fad¬†...¬´

Wir wurden wieder hereingerufen.

¬ªEine neue Gruppe¬†...¬´, sagte Capuzzi. Er war im Hemd und in Unterhosen
und hatte ein erhitztes Gesicht. Melanie hatte rote Flecken auf der
Brust, rote Ohren, aber sie lachte befriedigt und ihre Augen gl√§nzten.

¬ªO je¬´, lachte sie, ¬ªdie zwei haben's auch gemacht.¬´ Und sie ergriff
Alberts herabh√§ngenden Wedel, und zeigte ihn ihrem Mann.

Dann kam sie zu mir und fl√ºsterte mir zu: ¬ªWar's gut?¬´

¬ªWunderbar¬´, gab ich zur√ºck, um ihr Lust zu machen, ¬ªder kann's.¬´

¬ªJa, was tun wir denn?¬´ meinte Capuzzi, ¬ªwenn er dem Albert nicht mehr
steht¬†...?¬´

¬ªProduzier halt du dich¬†...¬´, riet ihm Melanie, ¬ªwerd' ich dich
photographieren.¬´

Capuzzi streifte die Kleider ab, und ich verschaute mich in eine riesige
Brust, die ganz dicht behaart war, in seine fabelhaften Arme, und in die
kolossale R√ºbe, die schwankend und ganz dunkelfarbig unter seinem Bauch
aufwuchs.

Er kam auf mich zu, aber Melanie rief: ¬ªHalt¬†..., das gibt es nicht¬†...,
mach die Buserantenstellungen mit dem Albert, aber la√ü das M√§del
gehn¬†...¬´

¬ªDie Buseranteng'schichten haben wir schon¬†...¬´, sagte er, ¬ªda w√§r's
schad um die Platte.¬´

¬ªIch will nicht, da√ü du mit dem M√§del da¬†...¬´, keifte sie.

¬ªL√§cherlich¬´, meinte Capuzzi, ¬ªwenn ich dich mit dem Albert markieren
lass'¬†..., werd' ich doch mit der Pepi markieren d√ºrfen¬†...¬´

¬ªNein¬´, rief Melanie eigensinnig, ¬ªdu wirst geil auf sie.¬´

¬ªKeine Spur¬†...¬´, verteidigte er sich, ¬ªh√∂chstens¬†...¬´, f√ºgte er hinzu,
¬ªh√∂chstens¬†..., mach' ich's dir noch einmal¬†...¬´

Das pa√üte ihr: ¬ªAber nur markieren¬†...¬´, gebot sie.

Ich legte mich auf das B√§nkchen und mu√üte die F√º√üe sehr weit spreizen,
damit er dazwischen k√∂nne.

¬ªAh nein¬´, sagte Capuzzi, ¬ªdas machen wir so!¬´ Und er hob meine Beine
hoch in die H√∂he, da√ü die Kn√∂chelgelenke auf seinen Schultern lagen.

¬ªJetzt¬´, rief er seiner Frau zu, und schob mir seinen Riesenkl√∂ppel bis
√ºber die Eichel hinein.

¬ªNicht so tief¬†...¬´, schrie Melanie, ¬ªnicht so tief.¬´

Ihr Verbot war √ºberfl√ºssig, denn was ich bei mir hatte, f√ºllte mich
ohnehin beinahe aus. Dazu kam noch, da√ü Capuzzis Schweif nicht ganz
steif war, als er ihn bei mir einf√ºhrte. Erst in meiner H√∂hle erholte er
sich von der eben absolvierten ehelichen Strapaze wieder, und ich hatte
den Genu√ü zu sp√ºren, wie er gr√∂√üer und gr√∂√üer wurde. Das ersetzte mir
die Bewegungslosigkeit, die vom Markieren herkam.

¬ªFertig¬´, meldete Frau Melanie.

Er lie√ü mich los und arrangierte eine andere Gruppe. Das hei√üt, er
setzte sich in einen Stuhl, nahm mich auf seinen Scho√ü, aber so, da√ü ich
mit dem R√ºcken an seiner Brust lehnte, und mit dem Gesicht in den
Apparat schaute. Mit den H√§nden fuhr er mir unter den Achseln durch und
umpre√üte meine Duteln, und seine R√ºbe pflanzte er in meinen Garten. Ich
wollte auf- und niederwetzen, aber er fl√ºsterte mir zu: ¬ªNicht
jetzt¬†...¬´

¬ªFertig¬´, rief die Frau aus dem Apparat hervor.

Eine dritte Gruppe sollte gebildet werden, aber da man dazu den Albert
gebraucht h√§tte, und seine Stange absolut nicht aufzurichten war, so
wurde die Sache auf ein anderesmal verschoben. Capuzzi bestellte mich
auf den √ºbern√§chsten Tag, gab mir f√ºnf Gulden und entlie√ü mich.

Ich ging in die Stadt. Am Graben traf ich die Zenzi und ging mit ihr ihn
die Sch√∂nlaterngasse, um ihr das verdiente Geld zu zeigen und die Sache
mit dem Photographen zu erz√§hlen. Sie hatte inzwischen niemanden gehabt.
Meine Schilderung von den verschiedenen Gruppen und Stellungen regte sie
sichtlich auf.

¬ªFix Laudon¬†...¬´, rief Zenzi, sich auf das Sofa werfend, ¬ªFix
Laudon¬†..., von dem Reden bin ich so viel aufgeregt¬†..., wenn ich nur
jetzt pudern k√∂nnt'¬†...¬´

Und in diesem Punkt war ich ihrer Ansicht. Ich kroch zu ihr aufs Sofa.
Zenzi lag da und hatte gl√§nzende Augen und ihre Br√ºste bebten. Sie kam
mir heute √ºberhaupt anders vor als gew√∂hnlich. Lang nicht so willenlos
und so gef√ºgig, wie zu Hause. Ich legte mich zu ihr und wir spielten uns
gegenseitig mit unseren Duteln eine Zeitlang. Ich wollte mich schon auf
sie hinaufschwingen, als sie mich mit dem Ausruf: ¬ª√Ñh¬†..., das ist ja
nix¬†...¬´, fortstie√ü und in die K√ºche hinausrief: ¬ªSagen S' Frau
B√∂ck¬†..., ist der Karl nicht da?¬´

Die Alte √∂ffnete die T√ºr: ¬ªJa, der Karl ist da¬†..., was wollen S' denn
von ihm?¬´

¬ªRufen S' ihn nur herein¬†...¬´, sagte Zenzi.

¬ªWas wollen S' denn?¬´ beharrte die Alte.

¬ªFragen S' nicht¬´, sagte Zenzi so befehlhaberisch, wie ich sie noch nie
geh√∂rt hatte. Ich lernte √ºberhaupt neue Seiten an ihr kennen. ¬ªFragen S'
nicht, sondern rufen S' ihn!¬´

Die Alte verschwand.

¬ªWer ist denn der Karl¬†...?¬´ fragte ich.

¬ªNa derer Alten ihr Enkel ist er¬´, erkl√§rte mir Zenzi, indem sie aus
ihrem Kleid was herausnahm, und sich wieder auf das Sofa legte.

¬ªUnd was willst du von ihm¬†...?¬´

¬ªV√∂geln soll er¬†...¬´, sagte sie gl√ºhend.

Die T√ºre ging auf und ein junger Mensch von sechzehn oder siebzehn
Jahren kam herein. Er war sehr h√ºbsch, hatte feine Z√ºge, aber sie waren
von der Magerkeit versch√§rft und gespitzt, und der ganze Bursch sah
verkommen aus. Er rauchte eine Zigarette, grinste, als er uns sah, und
ich mu√üte an die saubere Gesellschaft denken, die immer mit der
Burgmusik l√§uft.

¬ªServus Karl¬†...¬´, sagte Zenzi, ¬ªda hast einen Gulden¬†..., mach mir's
einmal.¬´ Karl kam zum Sofa herangeschlendert, nahm den Gulden, besah ihn
von allen Seiten, steckte ihn ein, und begann nachl√§ssig mit der Brust
von Zenzi zu spielen. Dabei schaute er mich pr√ºfend an.

¬ªBesinn dich nicht so lang¬†...¬´, rief Zenzi.

Er kn√∂pfte die Hose auf, und Zenzi stie√ü mich an: ¬ªSchau dir die Nudel
an, die der Bursch hat¬†..., so was gibt's nicht¬†...¬´

Karl grinste mir zu, und ich richtete mich auf, um seinen Nothelfer zu
begutachten. Aber Gott steh mir bei, so was hatte ich wirklich noch
nicht gesehen. Bis auf den Nabel und h√∂her hinauf noch reichte dieser
Balken, und hatte eine Dicke, die ihn be√§ngstigend machte. Der Kopf
allein war gr√∂√üer, als bei anderen der ganze Stempel.

¬ªNa¬´, meinte Zenzi, ¬ªder ist doch einen Gulden wert¬†...?¬´

Karl warf die Zigarette weg, und legte sich auf Zenzi.

¬ªIn Gottes Namen¬†...¬´, sagte er.

Zenzi rutschte hin und her unter ihm und bat: ¬ªSo komm doch¬†..., komm!¬´

¬ªSteck dir'n selber hinein¬†...¬´, brummte er grob.

Zenzi fuhr mit den H√§nden hin, und brach gleich darauf in woll√ºstiges
Kreischen aus: ¬ªAch¬†..., ach, fickerl mich¬†..., nicht so fest¬†...,
ach¬†..., mir kommt's¬†..., ach¬†..., mein lieber Karl¬†..., dich hab' ich
gern¬†..., bei dir m√∂cht' ich bleiben¬†..., Bester¬†...¬´

¬ªIch pfeif' auf dich¬†...¬´, zischte er, w√§hrend er seine Kanone rasch
hin- und herschob. Zenzi b√§umte sich unter ihm: ¬ªWas fickst mich denn
dann?¬´ keuchte sie. Er stie√ü zu und antwortete: ¬ªWeilst ein Gulden
gibst¬†..., wenn mir die Gro√ümutter ein' Gulden gibt, v√∂gel ich sie
auch¬†...¬´

Zenzi arbeitete mit ihrem ganzen Aufgebot und Karl stie√ü in sie hinein,
als sei er beleidigt worden. Mich regte die Sache so auf, da√ü ich mir es
auch zu √ºberlegen anfing, ob ich einen Gulden zahlen solle.

Aber Karl machte dem Dilemma ein Ende, indem er sich sofort empfahl,
nachdem seine Aufgabe erledigt war.

¬ªBleib da¬†...¬´, bat ihn Zenzi.

¬ªLa√ü mich aus¬†...¬´, sagte er grob.

¬ªWarum willst denn nicht noch ein bissel bei mir bleiben?¬´

¬ªWeil du mir zu fad bist¬†...¬´, antwortete er. ¬ªServus¬†...¬´, und er
verschwand.

Zenzi nahm ein Glas vom Tisch und schleuderte es hinter ihm her:
¬ªStrizzi¬†..., elender¬†...¬´, schrie sie. Das Glas sprang am T√ºrfutter in
Scherben. Zenzi weinte.

Ich hatte sie nie vorher so gesehen. ¬ªDas ist der einzige¬†..., der
einzige¬†..., den ich gern hab'¬†..., den Lumpen den¬†...¬´, schluchzte sie,
¬ªund ich lass' mich auch nimmer von ihm v√∂geln¬†..., was hab' ich denn
davon¬†...?¬´

Ganz erstaunt fragte ich sie: ¬ªUnd der Rudolf¬†...?¬´

¬ªAh was, der Rudolf¬´, zuckte sie die Achsel.

Ich: ¬ªDu hast doch den Rudolf so gern¬†..., du machst doch alles was er
will¬†...¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªMit dem Rudolf ist das was anderes¬†..., der k√∂nnt' mein Vater
sein¬†..., verliebt bin ich nicht¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªJa, aber¬†..., du sagst doch immer zu ihm, da√ü es dir nur immer bei
ihm kommt¬†..., da√ü er es am besten macht¬†...¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªWas sagt man nicht alles, wenn man die Eichel drin hat¬†..., ich
hab' doch von dir auch geh√∂rt, was du zu deinem Vater sprichst, wenn er
auf dir liegt, und es kommt dir grad¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªDas ist freilich wahr.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªIch bitt' dich, mit Rudolf bin ich jetzt acht Jahr beisammen¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªWas? Du bist ja im ganzen erst f√ºnfzehn Jahr alt¬†...¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªJa¬†..., das macht's. Meine Mutter war die Geliebte von
Rudolf¬†..., und wie sie an der Auszehrung gestorben ist, war ich allein,
und der Rudolf hat mich zu sich genommen¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªAls Geliebte¬†...?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªNein¬†..., im Anfang hab' ich in seinem Kabinett auf dem Erdboden
geschlafen¬†..., und war noch froh¬†..., ich hab' mich vor dem Waisenhaus
gef√ºrchtet.¬´

Ich: ¬ªWarum denn?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªWas wei√ü ich¬†..., die Mutter hat immer geweint, wie's im Spital
war, und hat gesagt: `Wenn ich stirb', kommt das arme Kind ins
Waisenhaus¬†...¬¥¬´

Ich: ¬ªWo warst du denn, wie die Mutter im Spital war¬†...?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªBeim Rudolf. Die Mutter war ja fr√ºher auch bei ihm. Sie hat ja
mit ihm gelebt¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªUnd dein Vater¬†...?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªAn den kann ich mich gar nicht mehr erinnern¬†..., der ist
gestorben¬†..., wie ich zwei Jahre alt war.¬´

Ich: ¬ªNa und weiter?¬´

Wir sa√üen noch immer nackt auf dem Sofa, und streichelten uns unsere
Br√ºste. Zenzi hatte sich ein wenig beruhigt, und es war ihr offenbar
angenehm, sich mir v√∂llig anzuvertrauen. Sie berichtete: ¬ªDer Rudolf hat
dann der Mutter versprochen, er nimmt sich meiner an, und ich darf bei
ihm bleiben¬†..., immer. Da ist dann die Mutter leichter gestorben.¬´

Ich: ¬ªDas glaub' ich.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªNa, und so bin ich halt ein paar Monat auf der Erd gelegen, und
der Rudolf hat im Bett geschlafen.¬´

Ich: ¬ªUnd dann ist's losgegangen, was?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªNicht sogleich. Erst hat er mich ins Bett gerufen¬†..., ich
brauch' nicht auf der Erden liegen, hat er gesagt.¬´

Ich: ¬ªHat er dich zuerst nicht anger√ºhrt?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªO ja. Wie ich mich zu ihm gelegt hab', hat er mir gleich das
Hemd aufgehoben, und hat seinen Finger in meine Spalte gelegt, und hat
mich √ºberall gestreichelt¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªWas hast du dir denn dabei gedacht?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªNichts.¬´

Ich: ¬ªWar's dir angenehm¬†...?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªO ja ... wei√üt du¬†..., er hat so ganz leise¬†..., so ganz stad
gestreichelt¬†..., das war schon gut¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªAber verstanden hast du nicht, was das ist, was?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªWieso denn nicht? Ich hab' sehr gut gewu√üt, was das bedeutet,
denn ich hab' ja oft in der Nacht geh√∂rt, wenn der Rudolf √ºber der
Mutter war.¬´

Ich: ¬ªSo? Und was hat er dann noch getan¬†...?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªDie ersten N√§chte nichts ... da hat er mich nur gestreichelt¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªAber davon kommt's ihm ja doch nicht¬†...?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªDann hat er mir seinen Schweif in die Hand gegeben¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªUnd du¬†...?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªDer Rudolf hat damals gleich zu mir gesagt: `Zenzi¬¥, hat er
gesagt, `jetzt bist du meine Geliebte. Du darfst niemandem was sagen,
und du wirst sehen, es wird dir gutgehen.¬¥¬´

Ich: ¬ªWar dir das recht?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªO ja. Das war mir schon recht, und dann war ich auch stolz
darauf, da√ü ich schon so einen Geliebten hab'. Und dann hab' ich mich
gefreut, da√ü es mir gutgehen wird; denn ich hab' als Kind so oft nichts
zu essen gehabt.¬´

Ich: ¬ªDann begreif' ich, da√ü dir das gepa√üt hat.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªAuch sonst. Ich hab' mich in der Nacht gef√ºrchtet allein zu
liegen, wie die Mutter tot war, und wenn ich beim Rudolf im Bett war,
hab' ich keine Angst mehr gehabt. √úbrigens h√§tt' ich auch so alles
getan, was er von mir wollen hat¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªAuch wenn es dir unangenehm gewesen w√§re¬†..., warum denn?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªAber freilich. Weil ich geglaubt hab', er jagt mich auf die
Stra√üen, wenn ich ihm nicht folge.¬´

Ich: ¬ªHat er denn damit gedroht¬†...?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªO ja. Er hat immer gesagt, wenn ich was ausplausch', so schmei√üt
er mich heraus. Dann wird mich die Polizei zusammenklauben, dann komm'
ich ins Waisenhaus, und dort werden die Kinder den ganzen Tag gehaut,
m√ºssen auf Erbsen knien und immerfort nur beten.¬´

Ich: ¬ªDa ist es freilich besser, wenn man in einem warmen Bett liegt und
eine hei√üe Nudel in die Hand bekommt.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªOder in den Bauch¬†..., hahaha.¬´

Ich: ¬ªNa, in den Bauch wirst du sie auch nicht gleich gekriegt haben.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªNein¬†..., nicht gleich. Der Rudolf hat mir das ganze Werkel erst
in die Hand gegeben. `Siehst du¬¥, hat er zu mir gesagt, `das da -- das
steckt der Mann der Frau hinein.¬¥ Wo hinein? frug ich. `Da hinein¬¥, sagt
er und zeigt mit dem Finger, wo bei mir der himmlische Zimmermann das
Loch gemacht hat.¬´

Ich: ¬ªDa hast du ja einen guten Lehrer gehabt.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªO ja. Ein guter Lehrer ist der Rudolf schon gewesen. `Das sind
die Eier¬¥, hat er mir erkl√§rt und hat mir seinen Beutel in die Hand
gegeben. `Und da spritzt man den Samen heraus, der kommt in den Bauch
der Frau, und davon kriegt sie dann ein Kind.¬¥¬´

Ich: ¬ªSo genau hab' ich es im Anfang nicht gewu√üt. Ich bin erst viel
sp√§ter drauf gekommen.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªEr hat mir alles beschrieben.¬´

Ich: ¬ªUnd weiter habt's ihr nichts gemacht?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªO ja¬†..., alles.¬´

Ich: ¬ªWas denn¬†..., alles?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªNa, wie er mir das V√∂geln erkl√§rt hat, hat er sich doch
draufgelegt und hat mich gewetzt.¬´

Ich: ¬ªIst ja nicht wahr, das gibt's ja nicht.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªAber nein¬†..., er hat ihn ja nur auswendig angerieben. Er hat
mir ja erkl√§rt, da√ü der Schwanz jetzt noch nicht hineingeht, sondern
erst sp√§ter, bis ich gr√∂√üer bin. Aber er hat mir nur zeigen wollen, wie
man's macht.¬´

Ich: ¬ªJa¬†..., und dabei selber spritzen.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªO nein¬†..., er hat so nicht gespritzt, immer nur, wenn er mir's
von hinten gemacht hat¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªIm Popo¬†..., ich wei√ü.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªIm Popo? Das geht doch nicht.¬´

Ich: ¬ªSo? Das geht nicht? Vor drei Jahren schon hat mich der Herr von
Horak in den Popo gefickt und hat mir dort hineingespritzt, weil's von
vorn damals noch nicht gegangen ist, bei mir.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªDa h√∂r' ich einmal was Neues. Das hab' ich noch nie gemacht. Ist
denn das gut?¬´

Ich: ¬ªO, sehr gut ist es, es kommt einem sofort.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªJa, tut's denn nicht furchtbar weh?¬´

Ich: ¬ªZuerst schon¬†..., aber wenn der Schwanz na√ü genug ist, gar nicht
mehr.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªSchad -- das mu√ü ich einmal probieren.¬´

Ich: ¬ªJetzt hast du's ja gar nicht mehr notwendig, jetzt geht's ja von
vorn¬†...¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªJa, der Rudolf hat mir damals den Schweif nur so von r√ºckw√§rts
durchgesteckt¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªDas kenn' ich. Man gibt die F√º√ü zusammen, und er reibt einem den
Schwanz unter den Arschbacken nach vorn¬†..., was?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªJa¬†..., genau so.¬´

Ich: ¬ªUnd so hat er gespritzt?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªJa¬†..., oder auch, wenn ich ihn in den Mund genommen hab'.¬´

Ich: ¬ªWas? Das habt ihr auch getan?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªJa. Zuerst war's mir schwer, und ich hab' auch ein paarmal
gebrochen. Aber dann ist's schon gegangen.¬´

Ich: ¬ªUnd hast du's geschluckt?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªManchesmal¬†..., ein bissel schluckt man ja √ºberhaupt immer.¬´

Ich: ¬ªUnd er¬†..., hat er nicht¬†...?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªAber nat√ºrlich. Stundenlang ist er mir auf der Fut gelegen und
hat sie mir ausgeschleckt und hat mir den Kitzler herausgesutzelt, denn
er hat gesagt: `Wart, das tu' ich dir, damit du auch davon was hast.¬¥¬´

Ich: ¬ªNa¬†..., und hast du was gehabt davon?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªSei so gut¬†..., das nimmt einen genug her, so wohl tut das.¬´

Ich: ¬ªJa¬†..., ich kenn' es¬†..., es ist s√º√ü¬†..., ich wollt', es w√§r'
jetzt jemand da, und m√∂cht's uns machen.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªJa¬†..., das wollt' ich auch.¬´

Wir qu√§lten uns schon die ganze Zeit an unseren Muscheln. Zenzi an der
meinigen und ich an ihrer. Jetzt konnten wir uns nicht mehr zur√ºckhalten
und legten uns nebeneinander hin und fingerten uns, da√ü uns bald wieder
der Quell zu flie√üen begann. Dann waren wir wieder beruhigt, setzten uns
auf, und ich verlangte, Zenzi solle weitererz√§hlen.

Sie tat es: ¬ªSchau meine Duteln an¬†...¬´, fuhr sie fort, ¬ªwie gro√ü sie
sind¬†..., der Rudolf sagt, da√ü ich sie vom vielen Schlecken und V√∂geln
so zeitig bekommen hab'. Schon mit neun Jahren hat's angefangen, und
Haare hab' ich damals schon zwischen den F√º√üen bekommen¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªUnd hast du immer nur mit dem Rudolf gev√∂gelt¬†...?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªO nein¬†..., der Rudolf hat mir g'sagt, wenn mich wer angreift,
oder wohin lockt, soll ich nur aufpassen, da√ü mir nichts geschieht, und
da√ü mich niemand sieht¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªWas? Er hat's dir damals schon erlaubt¬†...?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªAber ja. Er hat gesagt, ich soll nur ihn immer gern haben,
deswegen aber kann ich mir's schon von andern M√§nnern machen lassen. Nur
kleine Buben nicht. Wenn er das sieht, hat er g'sagt, schlagt er mich
tot.¬´

Ich: ¬ªDas ist aber komisch. Warum denn gerade kleine Buben nicht?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªNa, wegen des Geldes¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªDas versteh' ich nicht¬†...¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªAlso, der Rudolf hat gesagt: `Du kannst es schon hergeben, aber
du mu√üt immer was davon haben. Wenn dir einer auch nur die Fut angreift,
soll er dir was daf√ºr zahlen. Umsonst ist der Tod.¬¥¬´

Ich: ¬ªUnd der Rest das Leben. J√∂¬†..., da h√§tt' ich viel Geld verdienen
k√∂nnen, wenn ich gescheit gewesen w√§re.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªNa siehst du¬†..., deswegen bin ich immer beim Rudolf am
liebsten, weil er so viel gescheit ist, und man ihn um alles fragen
kann.¬´

Ich: ¬ªWarum hat er dann aber erlaubt, da√ü du dich von meinem Vater
pudern la√üt?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªDas ist doch sehr einfach. Wir zahlen doch seit damals keinen
Zins mehr bei euch.¬´

Ich: ¬ªSo¬†..., das ist aber gemein¬†..., und er v√∂gelt mich ganz
umsonst¬†...¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªNa¬†..., daf√ºr verr√§t er doch nicht, da√ü du mit deinem Vater
zusammensteckst¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªEs ist eine Gemeinheit¬†..., aber ich lass' ihn nicht mehr dr√ºber.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªMach was du willst, mir ist es ganz gleich.¬´

Ich: ¬ªLassen wir das jetzt gut sein, was haben wir denn davon, was?
Erz√§hl lieber weiter. Hast du damals schon Geld verdient?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªO ja. Zuerst war's der Kaufmann am Eck. Der hat mich immer so
angeschaut, und hat mich am Kinn gestreichelt, wenn ich drin war, was
kaufen. Und das hab' ich dem Rudolf erz√§hlt.¬´

Ich: ¬ªNa und was war weiter?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªDer Rudolf hat gesagt, ich soll alles mit ihm tun, was er will,
ich soll aber ein Geld von ihm verlangen.¬´

Ich: ¬ªUnd hast du was gekriegt¬†...?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªDas erstemal nur ein paar Sechserln.¬´

Ich: ¬ªWas war denn mit ihm?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªWie meinst du das?¬´

Ich: ¬ªNa, du wei√üt doch¬†..., ich meine, was er mit dir gemacht hat¬†...?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªEr ist vor dem Laden gestanden, wie ich vorbeigegangen bin.¬´

Ich: ¬ªNa, und du¬†...?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªIch hab' gelacht auf ihn¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªUnd er¬†...?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªEr hat mich hineingerufen¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªWeiter¬†..., weiter¬†...¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªNa, und da hat er mich ins Magazin gef√ºhrt.¬´

Ich: ¬ªWas hat er denn gesagt¬†...?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªEr hat mir gesagt, er will mir ged√∂rrte Zwetschgen schenken,
oder Feigen, oder so was.¬´

Ich: ¬ªJa¬†..., und¬†...?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªUnd wie wir im Magazin waren, hat er gesagt, ich hab' so eine
Feigen, die uns nur angenehm ist¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªDa hat er die Fut gemeint?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªJa.¬´

Ich: ¬ªUnd was hast du gesagt¬†...?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªNichts.¬´

Ich: ¬ªSo erz√§hl doch, la√ü dich nicht immer fragen.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªIch erz√§hl' ja¬†..., er hat gesagt, ich soll ihn die Feigen
ansehen lassen, die ich zwischen den F√º√üen hab'¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªDas ist gut¬†..., der macht's fein¬†...¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªWenn ich das tu'¬†..., hat er gesagt, schenkt er mir so viel
Feigen, wie ich will.¬´

Ich: ¬ªDas hast du doch getan¬†...?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªNein.¬´

Ich: ¬ªNein ... Ich i√ü Feigen sehr gern.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªIch auch.¬´

Ich: ¬ªNa und warum dann¬†...?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªIch hab' an den Rudolf gedacht, und hab' gesagt: Ich brauch'
keine Feigen, ich will was anderes. `Was denn?¬¥ fragt er. Geld, sag'
ich.¬´

Ich: ¬ªHat er dir was gegeben?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªZuerst hat er mir den Rock aufgehoben und hat herumgespielt.
Dann hat er seinen Kaufmannsh√§ring aus der Hosen genommen und ist mir
damit zwischen die F√º√üe und am Bauch hin- und hergefahren, bis er
gespritzt hat.¬´

Ich: ¬ªNa, und dann?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªDann hat er mir drei√üig Kreuzer geschenkt und hat gemeint, ich
soll niemanden was sagen.¬´

Ich: ¬ªHast du ihm gefolgt?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªNein, ich hab' das Geld dem Rudolf gegeben.¬´

Ich: ¬ªUnd warst du oft beim Kaufmann?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªO ja¬†..., oft. Ich hab' alles eingekauft, um was mich Rudolf
geschickt hat, und hab' nichts gezahlt daf√ºr¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªDas hei√üt, du bist daf√ºr ins Magazin gegangen.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªJa.¬´

Ich: ¬ªWen hast du noch gehabt?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªMeinen Schullehrer.¬´

Ich: ¬ªDen Lehrer¬†...?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªJa¬†..., wie ich in der vierten Klasse war.¬´

Ich: ¬ªAber der hat doch nichts bezahlt?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªH√∂r nur. Bei uns war ein M√§del, die hat schon damals dicke
Duteln gehabt, und der Lehrer hat sie immer dabei angegriffen, und sie
hat sich einen Haufen darauf eingebildet.¬´

Ich: ¬ªDie Gans, die bl√∂de.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªJa, eine Gans war sie.¬´

Ich: ¬ªErz√§hl doch, das ist lustig¬†..., mich hat auch der Katechet
gev√∂gelt.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªIch wei√ü.¬´

Ich: ¬ªAlso erz√§hl¬†...¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªWenn Turnen war, und der Lehrer hat uns geholfen, bei die Ringe,
oder beim Klettern, da hat er eine andere immer beim Arm oder beim
R√ºcken gepackt, dieses M√§del aber hat er immer bei ihren Duteln
erwischt, oder wenn Klettern war, hat er sie immer beim Arsch
genommen¬†..., und sie war dann ganz rot im Gesicht¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªDas glaub' ich.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªUnd ich hab' mich immer hingestellt, und hab' dem Lehrer ins
Gesicht gelacht.¬´

Ich: ¬ªUnd er?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªEr ist auch rot geworden.¬´

Ich: ¬ªWeiter¬†..., ich bin schon gespannt.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªUnd einmal hat das M√§del nicht auf den Barren k√∂nnen. Der Lehrer
hat sie vorn gehalten und hinten, und endlich hat er gesagt, sie soll
nach der Schule hierbleiben, und nachturnen.¬´

Ich: ¬ªAha¬†..., ich merke schon, was kommt.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªJa, das hab' ich auch gemerkt, und bin auch dageblieben.¬´

Ich: ¬ªIm Turnsaal?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªAh nein¬†..., ich hab' vor der Schule gewartet, bis das M√§del
fortgeht¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªNa, hat das lang gedauert?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªEine halbe Stunde ... Ich hab' sie begleitet und ausgefragt.¬´

Ich: ¬ªHat sie dir alles gesagt?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªZuerst nicht. Erst wie ich ihr gesagt habe: H√∂r du, warum packt
dich denn der Lehrer immer bei den Duteln und beim Popo¬†...? Da ist sie
dann mit der Sprache heraus.¬´

Ich: ¬ªNa¬†..., erz√§hl doch schneller.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªWarum denn? Wir haben ja Zeit ... Also, sie hat mir gesagt¬†...,
haha¬†..., ich mu√ü heute noch lachen, was das f√ºr eine Gans war¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªEr hat sie gev√∂gelt¬†...?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ª`H√∂r nur¬†..., der Lehrer hat was¬¥, sagte sie ... Was denn? frug
ich. `Aber du darfst es niemanden sagen¬¥, meint sie, na ich versprach
es ihr¬†..., `der Lehrer hat zwischen den F√º√üen einen St√∂psel¬¥, meint sie
darauf.¬´

Ich: ¬ªNein, so eine Gans¬†..., ein sch√∂nes Geheimnis¬†...¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªHat er dich ihn anschauen lassen? frug ich sie. `Ja¬¥, sagt sie.
Sie hat gar nicht gewu√üt, was das bedeutet. Und sie hat mir gesagt, der
Lehrer hat ihr den St√∂psel zwischen ihre F√º√üe gerieben und zwischen ihre
Duteln gesteckt, und dann hat er ihr lauter Einser versprochen, und dann
ist so viel Wasser aus seinem St√∂psel herausgelaufen.¬´

Ich: ¬ªNein¬†..., so ein Ganserl¬†..., so ein dummes.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªNa, ich hab' ihr aber alles erkl√§rt, und da ist sie gescheiter
geworden.¬´

Ich: ¬ªWieso¬†...?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªWeil sie gemeint hat: Ihr sei das Wurst, wie das Ding hei√üe, und
wenn sie nichts mehr lernen brauche, dann werde sie sich vom Lehrer
v√∂geln lassen, sooft er nur will.¬´

Ich: ¬ªNa, und du?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªIch hab' mir gedacht, das kann ich auch brauchen.¬´

Ich: ¬ªUnd wie war's denn mit dir?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªNa ich hab' doch auch schon damals Br√ºste gehabt, wenn auch nur
ganz kleine¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªUnd die hast du ihm gezeigt.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªJa¬†..., wie er mir wieder hat helfen wollen, und mir untern Arm
greift, sag' ich ihm, ich bitt' Herr Lehrer, ich bin kitzlig¬†..., und da
nimmt er mich um die Brust¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªNa, das wird er doch gewu√üt haben, was das ist.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªDas glaub' ich. Er hat mich gleich so angeschaut¬†..., und ich
hab' gelacht, und da sagt er mir: `Du mu√üt nachturnen, wenn die Schule
aus ist.¬¥¬´

Ich: ¬ªDas hab' ich mir gleich gedacht¬†...¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªWie dann alle fort sind, bin ich im finstern Ankleidezimmer
geblieben, und da kommt er zu mir und packt mich so langsam bei den
beiden Br√ºsten und fragt mich: `Turnst du gern?¬¥ Ja, Herr Lehrer, sag'
ich, und dr√ºckte seine H√§nde an mich.¬´

Ich: ¬ªDa hat er doch gewu√üt, was Neues ist¬†...¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªJa. Er ist mir gleich unter den Kittel, hat mich bei der Muschel
erwischt, und sagt: `Wem geh√∂rt denn das?¬¥¬´

Ich: ¬ªUnd was hast du gesagt?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªIch hab' mich noch dumm gestellt, und hab' gesagt: Ich wei√ü
nicht¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªDa hat er sich halt bedient.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªDarauf nimmt er meine Hand und steckt sie sich ins
Hosent√ºrl¬†..., und ich erwisch' seinen Notizstift, der kerzengrad parat
war. Da fragt er mich, `was ist denn das¬¥?¬´

Ich: ¬ªEine nette Pr√ºfung. Du hast sie doch bestanden?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªJa, denn ich hab' gesagt, das ist dem Herrn Lehrer sein
Schweif.¬´

Ich: ¬ªBravo. Das verdient einen Einser.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªFragt er weiter: `Zu was geh√∂rt denn das?¬¥¬´

Ich: ¬ªDu hast ihm's doch gesagt?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªAber nat√ºrlich, zum brunzen und zum v√∂geln geh√∂rt es, hab' ich
gesagt, und da ist er ganz n√§rrisch geworden.¬´

Ich: ¬ªDas glaub' ich. Das war halt anders wie bei dem dummen Ganserl.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ª`Na¬¥, meint er, `willst du lauter Einser haben, dann la√ü mich
v√∂geln¬†..., willst du¬†...?¬¥ O ja, ich will schon, gab ich zur Antwort,
aber ich brauch' nicht lauter Einser. `Was denn?¬¥ fragt er ganz erstaunt
... ein Geld, sag' ich drauf, ein Geld! Er war ganz paff. `Ich soll dir
ein Geld geben¬†...?¬¥ Ja. Ich hab' ihm ins Gesicht gelacht. `Wof√ºr denn?¬¥
fragt er und la√üt mich los. Aber ich hab' meinen Kittel in die H√∂he
gehalten, wie er von ihm aus hersah, und hab' alles hergezeigt, und
dabei sag' ich ganz keck: Wof√ºr? Na, daf√ºr, da√ü mich der Herr Lehrer
v√∂geln darf, und da√ü ich niemandem was sag'.¬´

Ich: ¬ªDas hat ihm eingeleuchtet?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªJa¬†..., und er hat gleich zum remmeln angefangen. Aber er hat
probiert, ob er mir ihn nicht hineinstecken kann. Aber das ist noch
nicht gegangen.¬´

Ich: ¬ªWarst du dann noch oft im Turnsaal?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªAber ja¬†..., und in den Mund genommen hab' ich's ihm, und er hat
mir nur f√ºnfzig Kreuzer gegeben.¬´

Ich: ¬ªUnd wie bist du denn da in die Stadt herein gekommen?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªNur durch den Rudolf.¬´

Ich: ¬ªDer kennt aber auch alles.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªJa, er hat gesagt, drau√üen bei uns ist ja doch kein Gesch√§ft,
und er hat mich hergef√ºhrt.¬´

Ich: ¬ªUnd ich bin auch da.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªJa¬†..., er hat immer gesagt¬†..., die Peperl¬†..., die kann was
verdienen, wenn sie gescheit ist¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªDas m√∂cht' mir schon passen.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªNa, du siehst ja, es geht.¬´

Ich: ¬ªNa, und ob das geht.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªWas hast denn verdient?¬´

Ich: ¬ªWart! Zwei Gulden im Haustor, f√ºnf Gulden der Alte¬†..., zehn
Gulden jetzt¬†..., zwei Gulden mu√ü ich der Alten geben, bleiben f√ºnfzehn
Gulden. Na, der Vater der wird sch√∂ne Augen machen, wenn ich so viel z'
Haus bring'.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªWas dir nicht einf√§llt, da w√§rst aber sch√∂n dumm¬†...¬´

Ich: ¬ªWieso?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªDu wirst doch nicht alles hergeben?¬´

Ich: ¬ªNicht?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªGott bewahre. Vielleicht verdienst du morgen gar nix¬†..., was
machst denn dann?¬´

Ich: ¬ªDann sag' ich halt, ich hab' nix verdient.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªSo? Und la√üt dich vielleicht zusammenschimpfen ... Ah nein,
schau mich an¬†..., wie ich's mach. Ich geb' einmal drei Gulden, einmal
f√ºnf, einmal sechs her, und der Rudolf freut sich, weil ich jeden Tag
was bring', und au√üerdem, sie m√∂chten ja ohnedies alles gleich
versaufen.¬´

Ich: ¬ªJa¬†..., ja¬†..., da hast du recht¬†...¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªUnd dann, du kannst doch selber ein Geld brauchen. Hast du eins,
mu√üt du keins verlangen, und wenn's dich freut, kauf dir was.¬´

Ich: ¬ªJa, und dann ahnt es der Vater, und wei√ü gleich, da√ü ich
geschummelt hab'.¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªO, du Tschapperl du¬†..., wenn er was sieht, dann sagst du, du
hast es von einem Herrn geschenkt gekriegt¬†..., immer geschenkt¬†..., das
ist das Beste. Und √ºbrigens mu√üt du halt lieb sein zum Vater¬†..., immer
nur lieb sein¬†..., dann la√üt er dir alles zu.¬´

Ich: ¬ªAha! Also deswegen schmeichelst du dem Rudolf so?¬´

Zenzi: ¬ªNat√ºrlich. Damit ich keinen Verdru√ü mit ihm hab', und machen
kann, was ich will.¬´

Wir kleideten uns an, beschlossen, obwohl es kaum noch d√§mmerte, heute
schon nach Hause zu gehen. Wir hatten beide genug, durften eines
freundlichen Empfanges sicher sein, und wollten keinen Herrn mehr
suchen. Wir fuhren mit dem Stellwagen in die Vorstadt.

Ich gab dem Vater f√ºnf Gulden. Er sagte nichts, aber er nahm das Geld
und holte Wein. Zenzi mu√üte Rudolf beichten, wie ich mich angestellt
h√§tte. Er lobte mich. Dann begann das √ºbliche Saufgelage, und ich lag in
dieser Nacht wieder unter meinem Vater.

So endete der erste Tag meines Hurenlebens. Ich war nun k√§uflich, war
ein Ding f√ºr jedermann.

Ich ging nun t√§glich in den ersten Nachmittagsstunden mit Zenzi oder
auch allein in die Stadt. Und das Geld, das ich verdiente, lieferte ich
prompt meinem Vater ab, der jetzt gar nicht mehr daran dachte, sich eine
Arbeit zu suchen, sondern es vorzog, auf meine Kosten zu leben und
meinen Verdienst zu vertrinken. Meine Br√ºder sah ich gar nicht mehr.
Franz war in Simmering, weit drau√üen, am entgegengesetzten Ende der
Stadt in der Lehre, und Lorenz, der die Wirtschaft, die bei uns war, von
Anfang an durchschaute, und der auch Rudolf nicht leiden mochte, lie√ü
sich gar nicht mehr blicken.

Von dem Geld, das ich mir behielt, kaufte ich mir heimlich hie und da
ein St√ºck zum anziehen oder auch zum putzen. Aber Rudolf erlaubte es
weder Zenzi noch mir, mit den guten Sachen angekleidet auf den Strich zu
gehen. Er meinte, wenn wir aufgeputzt dahergingen, werde die Polizei
aufmerksam auf uns werden und au√üerdem werden die Herren, die uns
nachliefen, wegbleiben, weil sie uns f√ºr konzessionierte Huren halten
w√ºrden, und weil nur die Heimlichkeit unseres Gewerbes reize.

Ich wu√üte nun alles, war in allen Schlichen und Pfiffen meines Metiers
bewandert, verstand mich darauf, den Wachm√§nnern auszuweichen und sie zu
t√§uschen, und verstand mich auch darauf, den Leuten, mit denen ich mich
abgab, so viel Geld als m√∂glich abzuluchsen.

Auch vor der Franzosenkrankheit war ich gewarnt und v√∂llig dar√ºber
aufgekl√§rt, wie man sie erkenne. Ich unterzog jeden Menschen, dem ich
mich hingab, einer genauen Visitation und bin heute noch froh dar√ºber.
Denn wenn ich auch manche Erkrankung nicht ganz vermeiden konnte, so bin
ich auch davor bewahrt geblieben, die Syphilis zu erleiden. Eigentlich
wie durch ein Wunder bewahrt geblieben, wenn ich's recht bedenke, denn
ich kam schlie√ülich in Situationen, in denen mir meine ganze Vorsicht
nichts geholfen h√§tte, und in denen ich hundertfach angesteckt h√§tte
werden k√∂nnen.

Rudolf habe ich in diesen Dingen viel zu danken gehabt. Er hat mich
gelehrt, auf die M√§nner achtzugeben, da√ü sie mir mit keiner Waffe nahen,
mich nicht am Halse w√ºrgen, oder mir den Mund zuhalten. Er war es, der
mir einsch√§rfte, wenn ich mit jemandem ins Hotel oder in die Wohnung
gehe, das Geld vorher zu verlangen, und er war es, der mich davor
warnte, jemals eine Kaserne zu betreten, es sei denn zu einem Offizier.

Ich kann nicht alles aufschreiben, was ich in diesen Jahren, was ich als
Hure √ºberhaupt erlebt habe. Meine Kindheitserinnerungen, so wechselvoll
und bewegt sie sein m√∂gen, sie sind mir haften geblieben, und ich habe
von ihnen berichtet. Schlie√ülich sind es Kindheitserinnerungen, wenn
auch freilich sehr geschlechtlich und sehr wenig kindlich. Aber sie
bleiben auf alle F√§lle viel tiefer und dauernder in unser Ged√§chtnis
eingegraben wie alles, was wir sp√§ter erleben.

Wenn man bedenkt, da√ü das Jahr 365 Tage hat, und wenn man nur, gering
gerechnet, den Tag mit drei M√§nnern einsch√§tzt, so macht das an
elfhundert M√§nner im Jahr, macht in drei Jahrzehnten wohl
dreiunddrei√üigtausend M√§nner. Es ist eine Armee. Und man wird es weder
anraten noch w√ºnschen, da√ü ich von jedem dieser dreiunddrei√üigtausend
Schweife, die mich im Laufe der Zeit bewedelt haben, einzeln
Rechenschaft ablege.

Es ist auch gar nicht notwendig, da√ü ich es tu! Weder f√ºr mich, die ich
diese Bl√§tter nur aufschreibe, um mein Leben in seinen Hauptz√ºgen an mir
vorbeigleiten zu lassen, noch f√ºr diejenigen, die in diesen
Aufzeichnungen vielleicht nach meinem Tode bl√§ttern werden. Denn im
Ganzen ist die Liebe unsinnig. Das Weib gleicht so einer alten
Rohrpfeife, die auch nur ein paar L√∂cher hat und auf der man eben auch
nur ein paar T√∂ne spielen kann. Die M√§nner tun alle dasselbe. Sie liegen
oben, wir liegen unten. Sie sto√üen und wir werden gesto√üen. Das ist der
ganze Unterschied.
