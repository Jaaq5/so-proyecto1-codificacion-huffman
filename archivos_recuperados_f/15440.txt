 a few seconds, in her ghastly pallor, in the tones of her
voice, that went through Gianluca like a knife. The dreadful instinctive
certainty that she loved the man she had so nearly killed, took
possession of him in a dark prevision of terror. Veronica was strong and
brave, but it would have been strange indeed if she had shown nothing of
what she felt.

It did not last long, and perhaps she knew what she had shown, for she
dropped Taquisara's arm, and the colour rushed to her face as she
stooped and picked up the foil with the green hilt. The hilts of the
others were blue, like those of many Neapolitan foils, and in the
lamp-light she could hardly distinguish the difference.

With sudden anger Veronica set her foot upon the steel and bent it up,
trying to break it. She could not, for it was of soft temper, but she
bent it out of all shape, so as to be useless.

She forced herself to take another, and they fenced again for a few
minutes. Gianluca watched them at first, but soon his head fell back,
and he stared at the ceiling. Death had entered into his soul. He had
guessed half the truth. But in the state in which he was on that
evening, and after what had passed between him and Veronica, the
suspicion alone would have been enough. Nothing could have saved him
from it, since it was indeed the truth. Such passionate, strong love
could only hide itself so long as it lived in the even, unchanging light
of monotonous days. In the flash of a danger, a terror, a violent
chance, its shape stood out for an instant and was not to be mistaken.

Gianluca scarcely spoke again on that evening. The next morning, before
he left his own room, Taquisara was with him, walking up and down and
smoking while Gianluca drank his coffee. They had been discussing the
accident of the previous evening, and Taquisara had laughed over it. But
Gianluca was sad and grave.

"I wish to ask you a question," he said, after a short silence. "When I
fainted, that day--did Don Teodoro pronounce all the proper words? You
must have heard him. Was it a real marriage, without any defect of
form?"

Taquisara stopped in his walk and hesitated. After all, since Don
Teodoro had written to him that the marriage must be performed again, it
was much better that Gianluca should be prepared for it, since he
himself had put the question.

"Since you ask me," answered Taquisara, after a moment's thought, "I may
as well tell you what I know. After it was done, both Don Teodoro and I
had doubts as to whether the marriage were perfectly valid, and he
determined to consult a bishop. I suppose that he has done so, for he
has written to me about it. He says that the ecclesiastical authority
before whom the matter was laid declares that there were informalities,
and that you must be married again. You see, in the first place, there
were no banns published in church, and there was no permission from the
bishop to omit publishing them. But, of course, that might be set aside.
I fancy that the real trouble may have been that you were unconscious.
At all events, it is a very simple matter to be married again."

"In other words, it is no marriage at all. I thought so--I thought so."
Gianluca repeated the words slowly and sadly.

"What does it matter?" asked Taquisara, turning away and walking again.
"It is a question of five minutes. I should think that you would be
glad--"

"Yes--perhaps I am glad," said Gianluca, so low that the words were
scarcely an interruption.

"Because you can be married in your full senses," continued Taquisara,
bravely, "with your father and mother beside you, and all the rest of
it."

Gianluca said nothing to this, and again there was a short silence. Just
as Taquisara came to the table in his walk, Gianluca spoke again.

"Stop a moment," he said. "Look at me, Taquisara. If you were in my
place, what would you do?"

Their eyes met, and Gianluca saw the quick effort of the other's
features, controlling themselves, as though he had been struck unawares.

"I?" exclaimed Taquisara, taken entirely off his guard. "If I were in
your place? Why--" he recovered himself--"I should get married again, as
soon as possible, of course. What else should any one do?"

But the bold eyes for once looked down a little, their steadiness
broken.

"You would do nothing of the sort," said Gianluca.

"What do you mean?" Again Taquisara started almost imperceptibly, and
his brows contracted as he looked up sharply.

"If you were in my place," said Gianluca, "you would cut your throat
rather than ruin the life of the woman you loved, by tying your misery
to her for life, a load for her to carry."

"Do not say such things!" exclaimed the Sicilian, turning suddenly from
the table and resuming his walk. "You are mad!"

"No--not mad. But not cowardly either. There is not much left of me, but
what there is shall not be afraid. I am not truly married to her. I will
not be. I will not die with that on my soul."

"Gianluca--for God's sake do not say such things!" Taquisara turned upon
him, staring.

He sat in his deep chair, his fair angel head thrown back, the dark blue
eyes bright, brave, and daring--all the rest, dead.

"I say them, and I mean them," he answered. "I love her very much. I
love her enough for that. I love her more than you do."

"Than I?" Taquisara's voice almost broke, as the blow struck him, but
there was no fear in his eyes either. He drew a breath then, and spoke
strong words. "Now may Christ forget me in the hour of death, if I have
not been true to you!"

"And me and mine if I blast your life and hers," came back the
unflinching answer.

A deep silence fell upon them both. At last Gianluca spoke again, and
his voice sank to another tone.

"She loves you, too," he said.

"Loves me?" cried Taquisara, his brows suddenly close bent. "Oh no!
Unsay that, or--no--Gianluca--how dare you even dream the right to say
that of your wife?"

It was beyond his strength to bear.

"She is not my wife," said Gianluca. "You have told me so--she is not my
wife. She has done what no other living woman could have done, to be my
wife and to love me. But she is not my wife, and what I say is true, and
right as well, your right and hers.

"No--not that--not hers." Taquisara turned half round, against the
table, where he stood, and his voice was low and broken.

"Yes, hers. You will know it soon--when I have taken my love to my
grave, and left her yours on earth."

"Gianluca!"

Taquisara could not speak, beyond that, but he laid his hand upon his
friend's arm and clutched it, as though to hold him back. His dark eyes
darkened, and in them were the terrible tears that strong men shed once
in life, and sometimes once again, but very seldom more.

Gianluca's thin fingers folded upon the hand that held him.

"You have been very true to me," he said. "She will be quite safe with
you."

For a long time they were both silent. It began to rain, and the big
drops beat against the windows, melancholy as the muffled drum of a
funeral march, and the grey morning light grew still more dim.

"I will not go into the other room just yet," said Gianluca, quietly. "I
would rather be alone for a little while."

Their eyes met once more, and Taquisara went away without a word.

That had been almost the last act of the strange tragedy of love and
death which had been lived out in slow scenes during those many weeks.
It was needful that it should come, and inevitable, soon or late. It
began when Gianluca made that one last desperate effort to move, in
sudden certainty of hope that ended in the instant foreknowledge of what
was to be. A little thing swayed him then--such a little thing as the
accident of a sharp foil, a rent in a jacket, the woman's blinding fear
for the man she loved. There are many arrows in fate's quiver, and the
little ones are as keen as the long shafts, and quicker to find the
tender mark.

The man was born to suffer, but he had in him that something divine by
which martyrs made death the witness of life and turned despair of earth
to sure hope of heaven.

He had ever been a man tender and gentle. His nature did not fail him
now. With exquisite devotion and thought for Veronica's happiness, and
with a love for her that penetrated the short future of near death, he
would not say to her what he had said to Taquisara. He would not let one
breath of doubt disturb her only satisfaction while he still lived, nor
trouble her with the least fear lest she had not done all her fullest to
give him happiness while she could. In the end, it was his love that cut
short his living, and no one knew what hours and days and nights of pain
he bore, till the end came. He made of his love and his death a way for
her life. She had given him all she had. He gave it back to her a
hundred-fold, but she should not know, while he lived, that her great
gift had not been to him more than she could make it, all that she
wished it might be, all that she knew it was not.

He had not far to carry his burden; but except his friend, no one should
know the heaviness of his heart, neither his father nor his mother, and
least of all, Veronica. He could not hide that he was dying, but he
could hide the cost of it, and its bitterness. After that day, his life
went from him, as the strength falls away from a ship's sails when the
breeze is softly dying on a summer's evening. In fear Veronica watched
him, and in fear she met Taquisara's eyes. In the long nights, when it
rained and there was no moon, the darkness of death's wings was in the
air, and she held her breath, alone in her dim room.

They all knew it, and none said it, though shadow answered shadow in one
another's faces when they met. It was as though another element than air
had descended amongst them, dull, unresonant, hushing word and tread.

For each life we love is a sun, in our lives that would be dark if there
were no love in them, and when it goes down to its setting in our
hearts, the last light of love's day is very deep and tender, as no
other is after it, and the passionate, sad twilight of regret deepens
to a darkness of great loneliness over all, until our tears are wept,
and our souls take of our mortal selves memories of love undying.

The end came soon, in the night, for it was his will to live that had
kept him with them so long. Taquisara was with him. One by one the
others came, hastily muffled and wrapped in dark robes, for the night
was cold and damp even within doors. One after another they came, and
they stood and knelt beside him on the right and left. He spoke to them
all,--to his father and his mother first, for he felt the tide ebbing.
With streaming eyes Veronica bent down and looked for the fading light
in his, through her fast-falling tears. And close to her his mother
stretched out weak hands that trembled with every breaking sob. His
father knelt there, burying his face against the pillow, shaking all
over, his arms hanging down loose and helpless by his sides, bent,
bowed, crushed, as a weak old lion, stricken in age and cruelly wounded
to death. And above them all, Taquisara's sad, deep-chiselled face
looked down, as the face of a bronze statue beside a grave. Without, the
winter's rain beat a low dead-march on the great windows, and the
southwest wind sighed out its vast breath along the castle walls.

It was long since he had spoken, and they thought that they should never
hear his voice again. But still the last light lingered in his eyes.
Very little was left for him to do.

He moved Veronica's right hand, that was in his, drawing it a little,
and she let it move; and his other held Taquisara's, and he drew it
also, they yielding, till the two touched, and at his dying will clasped
one another. Then he smiled faintly, his last smile on earth. And as it
faded forever, there came back to them from beyond all pain the words of
his blessing upon their two strong young lives.

"Benedicat vos omnipotens Deus--" and the angels heard the rest.

Thus died Gianluca della Spina.

THE END.

Chicago, Ill.

Dear Johnny:

When I saw your Raggedy Ann books and dolls in a store near here, I went
right in and bought one of each, and when I had read your introduction
to "Raggedy Ann" I went right up to an old trunk in my own attic and
brought down the doll I am sending you with this letter.

This doll belonged to my mother and she played with it when a little
girl. She treasured it highly, I know, for she kept it until I came and
then she gave it to me.

The fun that we two have had together I cannot begin to tell you, but
often, like the little boy who went out into the garden to eat worms
when all the world seemed blue and clouded, this doll and I went out
under the arbor and had our little cry together. I can still feel it's
soft rag arms (as I used to imagine) about me, and hear the words of
comfort (also imaginary) that were whispered in my ear.

As you say in your Raggedy Ann book, "Fairyland must be filled with rag
dolls, soft loppy rag dolls who go through all the beautiful adventures
found there, nestling in the crook of a dimpled arm." I truly believe
there is such a fairyland and that rag dolls were first made there, or
how else could they bring so much sunshine into a child's life?

[Illustration: Raggedy Ann bowing]

All the little girls of my acquaintance have your Raggedy Ann book and
doll, and for the happiness you have brought to them let me give to you
the doll of all my dolls, the doll I loved most dearly.

May it prove to you a gift from Fairyland, bringing with it all the
"wish come true" that you may wish and, if possible, add to the sunshine
in your life.

My mother called the doll Raggedy Andy and it was by this name that I
have always known him. Is it any wonder that I was surprised when I saw
the title of your book?

Introduce Raggedy Andy to Raggedy Ann, dear Johnny. Let him share in the
happiness of your household.

                                    Sincerely yours,
                                         Raggedy Andy's "Mama."

       *       *       *       *       *

                                    Wilton, Connecticut,
                                    January 12, 1919.

Dear John:

Your letter brings many pleasant memories to my mind and takes me back
to my childhood.

Living next door to us, when I was about four years old, was a little
girl named Bessie; I cannot recall her last name. When my mother made
Raggedy Ann for me, Bessie's mother made a rag doll for her, for we two
always played together; as I recall, there was no fence between our two
houses.

Bessie's doll was made a day or so after Raggedy Ann, I think, though I
am not quite certain which of the two dolls was made first. However,
Bessie's doll was given the name of Raggedy Andy, and one of the two
dolls was named after the other, so that their names would sound alike.

We children played with the two rag dolls most of the time until
Bessie's family moved away--when I was eight or nine years old. They had
faces just alike; the mother who made the first doll probably painted
both doll faces. I do not remember just how Raggedy Andy was dressed,
but I know he often wore dresses over his boy clothes when Bessie and I
decided that he and Raggedy Ann should be sisters for the day.

You will remember I told you about Raggedy Andy long ago, John.

Isn't it strange that the two old rag dolls should come together after
all these years? I wish Raggedy Andy's "Mama" had signed her name, for I
should like to write to her. Perhaps there may be some way of finding
her out.

Anyway, it seems to me you have the subject for another rag doll book,
for Raggedy Andy must have had some wonderful adventures in his long
life.

                                    Yours lovingly,
                                              Mom.

HOW RAGGEDY ANDY CAME


One day Daddy took Raggedy Ann down to his office and propped her up
against some books upon his desk; he wanted to have her where he could
see her cheery smile all day, for, as you must surely know, smiles and
happiness are truly catching.

Daddy wished to catch a whole lot of Raggedy Ann's cheeriness and
happiness and put all this down on paper, so that those who did not have
Raggedy Ann dolls might see just how happy and smiling a rag doll can
be.

So Raggedy Ann stayed at Daddy's studio for three or four days.

She was missed very, very much at home and Marcella really longed for
her, but knew that Daddy was borrowing some of Raggedy Ann's sunshine,
so she did not complain.

Raggedy Ann did not complain either, for in addition to the sunny, happy
smile she always wore (it was painted on), Raggedy Ann had a candy
heart, and of course no one (not even a rag doll) ever complains if they
have such happiness about them.

One evening, just as Daddy was finishing his day's work, a messenger boy
came with a package; a nice, soft lumpy package.

Daddy opened the nice, soft lumpy package and found a letter.

Gran'ma had told Daddy, long before this, that at the time Raggedy Ann
was made, a neighbor lady had made a boy doll, Raggedy Andy, for her
little girl, who always played with Gran'ma.

And when Gran'ma told Daddy this she wondered whatever had become of her
little playmate and the boy doll, Raggedy Andy.

After reading the letter, Daddy opened the other package which had been
inside the nice, soft, lumpy package and found--Raggedy Andy.

Raggedy Andy had been carefully folded up.

His soft, loppy arms were folded up in front of him and his soft, loppy
legs were folded over his soft, loppy arms, and they were held this way
by a rubber band.

Raggedy Andy must have wondered why he was being "done up" this way, but
it could not have caused him any worry, for in between where his feet
came over his face Daddy saw his cheery smile.

After slipping off the rubber band, Daddy smoothed out the wrinkles in
Raggedy Andy's arms and legs.

Then Daddy propped Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy up against books on his
desk, so that they sat facing each other; Raggedy Ann's shoe button eyes
looking straight into the shoe button eyes of Raggedy Andy.

They could not speak--not right out before a real person--so they just
sat there and smiled at each other.

Daddy could not help reaching out his hands and feeling their throats.

Yes! There was a lump in Raggedy Ann's throat, and there was a lump in
Raggedy Andy's throat. A cotton lump, to be sure, but a lump
nevertheless.

"So, Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy, that is why you cannot talk, is it?"
said Daddy.

"I will go away and let you have your visit to yourselves, although it
is good to sit and share your happiness by watching you."

Daddy then took the rubber band and placed it around Raggedy Ann's right
hand, and around Raggedy Andy's right hand, so that when he had it fixed
properly they sat and held each other's hands.

Daddy knew they would wish to tell each other all the wonderful things
that had happened to them since they had parted more than fifty years
before.

So, locking his studio door, Daddy left the two old rag dolls looking
into each other's eyes.

The next morning, when Daddy unlocked his door and looked at his desk,
he saw that Raggedy Andy had fallen over so that he lay with his head in
the bend of Raggedy Ann's arm.

THE NURSERY DANCE


When Raggedy Andy was first brought to the nursery he was very quiet.

Raggedy Andy did not speak all day, but he smiled pleasantly to all the
other dolls. There was Raggedy Ann, the French doll, Henny, the little
Dutch doll, Uncle Clem, and a few others.

Some of the dolls were without arms and legs.

One had a cracked head. She was a nice doll, though, and the others all
liked her very much.

All of them had cried the night Susan (that was her name) fell off the
toy box and cracked her china head.

Raggedy Andy did not speak all day.

But there was really nothing strange about this fact, after all.

None of the other dolls spoke all day, either.

Marcella had played in the nursery all day and of course they did not
speak in front of her.

Marcella thought they did, though, and often had them saying things
which they really were not even thinking of.

For instance, when Marcella served water with sugar in it and little
oyster crackers for "tea," Raggedy Andy was thinking of Raggedy Ann, and
the French doll was thinking of one time when Fido was lost.

Marcella took the French doll's hand, and passed a cup of "tea" to
Raggedy Andy, and said, "Mr. Raggedy Andy, will you have another cup of
tea?" as if the French doll was talking.

And then Marcella answered for Raggedy Andy, "Oh, yes, thank you! It is
so delicious!"

Neither the French doll nor Raggedy Andy knew what was going on, for
they were thinking real hard to themselves.

Nor did they drink the tea when it was poured for them. Marcella drank
it instead.

Perhaps this was just as well, for, most of the dolls were moist inside
from the "tea" of the day before.

Marcella did not always drink all of the tea, often she poured a little
down their mouths.

Sugar and water, if taken in small quantities, would not give the dolls
colic, Marcella would tell them, but she did not know that it made their
cotton, or sawdust insides, quite sticky.

Quite often, too, Marcella forgot to wash their faces after a "tea," and
Fido would do it for them when he came into the nursery and found the
dolls with sweets upon their faces.

Really, Fido was quite a help in this way, but he often missed the
corners of their eyes and the backs of their necks where the "tea" would
run and get sticky. But he did his best and saved his little Mistress a
lot of work.

No, Raggedy Andy did not speak; he merely thought a great deal.

One can, you know, when one has been a rag doll as long as Raggedy Andy
had. Years and years and years and years!

Even Raggedy Ann, with all her wisdom, did not really know how long
Raggedy Andy and she had been rag dolls.

If Raggedy Ann had a pencil in her rag hand and Marcella guided it for
her, Raggedy Ann could count up to ten--sometimes. But why should one
worry one's rag head about one's age when all one's life has been one
happy experience after another, with each day filled with love and
sunshine?

[Illustration: Raggedy Andy in a chair]

Raggedy Andy did not know his age, but he remembered many things that
had happened years and years and years ago, when he and Raggedy Ann were
quite young.

It was of these pleasant times Raggedy Andy was thinking all day, and
this was the reason he did not notice that Marcella was speaking for
him.

Raggedy Andy could patiently wait until Marcella put all the dollies to
bed and left them for the night, alone in the nursery.

The day might have passed very slowly had it not been for the happy
memories which filled Raggedy Andy's cotton-stuffed head.

But he did not even fidget.

Of course, he fell out of his chair once, and his shoe button eyes went
"Click!" against the floor, but it wasn't his fault. Raggedy Andy was so
loppy he could hardly be placed in a chair so that he would stay, and
Marcella jiggled the table.

Marcella cried for Raggedy Andy, "AWAA! AWAA!" and picked him up and
snuggled him and scolded Uncle Clem for jiggling the table.

Through all this Raggedy Andy kept right on thinking his pleasant
thoughts, and really did not know he had fallen from the chair.

You see how easy it is to pass over the little bumps of life if we are
happy inside.

And so Raggedy Andy was quiet all day, and so the day finally passed.

Raggedy Andy was given one of Uncle Clem's clean white nighties and
shared Uncle Clem's bed. Marcella kissed them all good night and left
them to sleep until morning.

But as soon as she had left the room all the dolls raised up in their
beds. When their little mistress' footsteps passed out of hearing, all
the dollies jumped out of their beds and gathered around Raggedy Andy.

Raggedy Ann introduced them one by one and Raggedy Andy shook hands with
each.

[Illustration: Raggedy Andy on his face]

[Illustration: Shaking hands]

"I am very happy to know you all!" he said, in a voice as kindly as
Raggedy Ann's, "and I hope we will all like each other as much as
Raggedy Ann and I have always liked each other!"

"Oh, indeed we shall!" the dollies all answered. "We love Raggedy Ann
because she is so kindly and happy, and we know we shall like you too,
for you talk like Raggedy Ann and have the same cheery smile!"

"Now that we know each other so well, what do you say to a game, Uncle
Clem?" Raggedy Andy cried, as he caught Uncle Clem and danced about the
floor.

Henny, the Dutch doll, dragged the little square music box out into the
center of the room and wound it up. Then all, catching hands, danced in
a circle around it, laughing and shouting in their tiny doll voices.

"That was lots of fun!" Raggedy Andy said, when the music stopped and
all the dolls had taken seats upon the floor facing him. "You know I
have been shut up in a trunk up in an attic for years and years and
years."

"Wasn't it very lonesome in the trunk all that time?" Susan asked in
her queer little cracked voice. You see, her head had been cracked.

"Oh, not at all," Raggedy Andy replied, "for there was always a nest of
mice down in the corner of the trunk. Cute little Mama and Daddy mice,
and lots of little teeny weeny baby mice. And when the mama and daddy
mice were away, I used to cuddle the tiny little baby mice!"

"No wonder you were never lonesome!" said Uncle Clem, who was very kind
and loved everybody and everything.

"No, I was never lonesome in the old trunk in the attic, but it is far
more pleasant to be out again and living here with all you nice
friends!" said Raggedy Andy.

And all the dolls thought so too, for already they loved Raggedy Andy's
happy smile and knew he would prove to be as kindly and lovable as
Raggedy Ann.

THE SPINNING WHEEL


One night, after all the household had settled down to sleep, Raggedy
Andy sat up in bed and tickled Uncle Clem.

Uncle Clem twisted and wiggled in his sleep until finally he could stand
it no longer and awakened.

"I dreamed that some one told me the funniest story!" said Uncle Clem;
"But I cannot remember what it was!"

"I was tickling you!" laughed Raggedy Andy.

When the other dolls in the nursery heard Raggedy Andy and Uncle Clem
talking, they too sat up in their beds.

"We've been so quiet all day," said Raggedy Andy. "Let's have a good
romp!"

This suggestion suited all the dolls, so they jumped out of their beds
and ran over towards Raggedy Andy's and Uncle Clem's little bed.

Raggedy Andy, always in for fun, threw his pillow at Henny, the Dutch
doll.

Henny did not see the pillow coming towards him so he was knocked head
over heels.

Henny always said "Mama" when he was tilted backward or forward, and
when the pillow rolled him over and over, he cried, "Mama, Mama, Mama!"

It was not because it hurt him, for you know Santa Claus always sees to
it that each doll he makes in his great workshop is covered with a very
magical Wish, and this Wish always keeps them from getting hurt.

Henny could talk just as well as any of the other dolls when he was
standing up, sitting, or lying down, but if he was being tipped forward
and backward, all he could say was, "Mama."

This amused Henny as much as it did the other dolls, so when he jumped
to his feet he laughed and threw the pillow back at Raggedy Andy.

Raggedy Andy tried to jump to one side, but forgot that he was on the
bed, and he and Uncle Clem went tumbling to the floor.

Then all the dolls ran to their beds and brought their pillows and had
the jolliest pillow fight imaginable.

The excitement ran so high and the pillows flew so fast, the floor of
the nursery was soon covered with feathers. It was only when all the
dolls had stopped to rest and put the feathers back into the pillow
cases that Raggedy Andy discovered he had lost one of his arms in the
scuffle.

The dolls were worried over this and asked, "What will Marcella say when
she sees that Raggedy Andy has lost an arm?"

"We can push it up his sleeve!" said Uncle Clem. "Then when Raggedy Andy
is taken out of bed in the morning, Marcella will find his arm is
loose!"

"It has been hanging by one or two threads for a day or more!" said
Raggedy Andy. "I noticed the other day that sometimes my thumb was
turned clear around to the back, and I knew then that the arm was
hanging by one or two threads and the threads were twisted."

Uncle Clem pushed Raggedy Andy's arm up through his sleeve, but every
time Raggedy Andy jumped about, he lost his arm again.

"This will never do!" said Raggedy Ann. "Raggedy Andy is lopsided with
only one arm and he cannot join in our games as well as if he had two
arms!"

[Illustration: Pillow fight]

"Oh, I don't mind that!" laughed Raggedy Andy. "Marcella will sew it
on in the morning and I will be all right, I'm sure!"

"Perhaps Raggedy Ann can sew it on now!" suggested Uncle Clem.

"Yes, Raggedy Ann can sew it on!" all the dolls cried. "She can play
Peter, Peter, Pumpkin Eater on the toy piano and she can sew!"

"I will gladly try," said Raggedy Ann, "but there are no needles or
thread in the nursery, and I have to have a thimble so the needle can be
pressed through Raggedy Andy's cloth!"

"Marcella always gets a needle from Mama!" said the French Doll.

"I know," said Raggedy Ann, "but we cannot waken Mama to ask her!"

The dolls all laughed at this, for they knew very well that even had
Mama been awake, they would not have asked her for needle and thread,
because they did not wish her to know they could act and talk just like
real people.

"Perhaps we can get the things out of the machine drawer!" Henny
suggested.

"Yes," cried Susan, "let's all go get the things out of the machine
drawer! Come on, everybody!"

And Susan, although she had only a cracked head, ran out the nursery
door followed by all the rest of the dolls.

Even the tiny little penny dolls clicked their china heels upon the
floor as they followed the rest, and Raggedy Andy, carrying his loose
arm, thumped along in the rear.

Raggedy Andy had not lived in the house as long as the others; so he did
not know the way to the room in which the machine stood.

After much climbing and pulling, the needle and thread and thimble were
taken from the drawer, and all raced back again to the nursery.

Uncle Clem took off Raggedy Andy's waist, and the other dolls all sat
around watching while Raggedy Ann sewed the arm on again.

Raggedy Ann had only taken two stitches when she began laughing so hard
she had to quit. Of course when Raggedy Ann laughed, all the other dolls
laughed too, for laughter, like yawning, is very catching.

"I was just thinking!" said Raggedy Ann. "Remember, 'way, 'way back, a
long, long time ago, I sewed this arm on once before?" she asked Raggedy
Andy.

"I do remember, now that you mention it," said Raggedy Andy, "but I can
not remember how the arm came off!"

"Tell us about it!" all the dolls cried.

"Let's see!" Raggedy Ann began. "Your Mistress left you over at our
house one night, and after everyone had gone to bed, we went up into the
attic!"

"Oh, yes! I do remember now!" Raggedy Andy laughed. "We played with the
large whirligig!"

"Yes," Raggedy Ann said. "The large spinning wheel. We held on to the
wheel and went round and round! And when we were having the most fun,
your feet got fastened between the wheel and the rod which held the
wheel in position and there you hung, head down!"

"I remember, you were working the pedal and I was sailing around very
fast," said Raggedy Andy, "and all of a sudden the wheel stopped!"

"We would have laughed at the time," Raggedy Ann explained to the other
dolls, "but you see it was quite serious."

"My mistress had put us both to bed for the night, and if she had
discovered us 'way up in the attic, she would have wondered how in the
world we got there! So there was nothing to do but get Raggedy Andy out
of the tangle!"

"But you pulled me out all right!" Raggedy Andy laughed.

"Yes, I pulled and I pulled until I pulled one of Raggedy Andy's arms
off," Raggedy Ann said. "And then I pulled and pulled until finally his
feet came out of the wheel and we both tumbled to the floor!"

"Then we ran downstairs as fast as we could and climbed into bed, didn't
we!" Raggedy Andy laughed.

[Illustration: Raggedy Ann sewing]

"Yes, we did!" Raggedy Ann replied. "And when we jumped into bed, we
remembered that we had left Raggedy Andy's arm lying up on the attic
floor, so we had to run back up there and get it! Remember, Raggedy
Andy?"

"Yes! Wasn't it lots of fun?"

"Indeed it was!" Raggedy Ann agreed.

"Raggedy Andy wanted to let the arm remain off until the next morning,
but I decided it would be better to have it sewed on, just as it had
been when Mistress put us to bed. So, just like tonight, we went to the
pincushion and found a needle and thread and I sewed it on for him!"

"There!" Raggedy Ann said, as she wound the thread around her hand and
pulled, so that the thread broke near Raggedy Andy's shoulder. "It's
sewed on again, good as new!"

"Thank you, Raggedy Ann!" said Raggedy Andy, as he threw the arm about
Raggedy Ann's neck and gave her a hug.

"Now we can have another game!" Uncle Clem cried as he helped Raggedy
Andy into his waist and buttoned it for him.

Just then the little Cuckoo Clock on the nursery wall went, "Whirrr!"
the little door opened, and the little bird put out his head and cried,
"Cuckoo! cuckoo! cuckoo! cuckoo!"

"No more games!" Raggedy Ann said. "We must be very quiet from now on.
The folks will be getting up soon!"

"Last one in bed is a monkey!" cried Raggedy Andy.

There was a wild scramble as the dolls rushed for their beds, and Susan,
having to be careful of her cracked head, was the monkey. So Raggedy
Andy, seeing that Susan was slow about getting into her bed, jumped out
and helped her.

Then, climbing into the little bed which Uncle Clem shared with him, he
pulled the covers up to his eyes and, after pretending to snore a couple
of times, he lay very quiet, thinking of the kindness of his doll
friends about him, until Marcella came and took him down to breakfast.

And all the other dolls smiled at him as he left the room, for they were
very happy to know that their little mistress loved him as much as they
did.

THE TAFFY PULL


"I know how we can have a whole lot of fun!" Raggedy Andy said to the
other dolls. "We'll have a taffy pull!"

"Do you mean crack the whip, Raggedy Andy?" asked the French doll.

"He means a tug of war, don't you, Raggedy Andy?" asked Henny.

"No," Raggedy Andy replied, "I mean a taffy pull!"

"If it's lots of fun, then show us how to play the game!" Uncle Clem
said. "We like to have fun, don't we?" And Uncle Clem turned to all the
other dolls as he asked the question.

"It really is not a game," Raggedy Andy explained. "You see, it is only
a taffy pull.

"We take sugar and water and butter and a little vinegar and put it all
on the stove to cook. When it has cooked until it strings 'way out when
you dip some up in a spoon, or gets hard when you drop some of it in a
cup of water, then it is candy.

"Then it must be placed upon buttered plates until it has cooled a
little, and then each one takes some of the candy and pulls and pulls
until it gets real white. Then it is called 'Taffy'."

"That will be loads of fun!" "Show us how to begin!" "Let's have a
taffy pull!" "Come on, everybody!" the dolls cried.

"Just one moment!" Raggedy Ann said. She had remained quiet before, for
she had been thinking very hard, so hard, in fact, that two stitches had
burst in the back of her rag head. The dolls, in their eagerness to have
the taffy pull, were dancing about Raggedy Andy, but when Raggedy Ann
spoke, in her soft cottony voice, they all quieted down and waited for
her to speak again.

"I was just thinking," Raggedy Ann said, "that it would be very nice to
have the taffy pull, but suppose some of the folks smell the candy while
it is cooking."

"There is no one at home!" Raggedy Andy said. "I thought of that,
Raggedy Ann. They have all gone over to Cousin Jenny's house and will
not be back until day after tomorrow. I heard Mama tell Marcella."

"If that is the case, we can have the taffy pull and all the fun that
goes with it!" Raggedy Ann cried, as she started for the nursery door.

After her ran all the dollies, their little feet pitter-patting across
the floor and down the hall.

When they came to the stairway Raggedy Ann, Raggedy Andy, Uncle Clem and
Henny threw themselves down the stairs, turning over and over as they
fell.

The other dolls, having china heads, had to be much more careful; so
they slid down the banisters, or jumped from one step to another.

Raggedy Ann, Raggedy Andy, Uncle Clem and Henny piled in a heap at the
bottom of the steps, and by the time they had untangled themselves and
helped each other up, the other dolls were down the stairs.

To the kitchen they all raced. There they found the fire in the stove
still burning.

Raggedy Andy brought a small stew kettle, while the others brought the
sugar and water and a large spoon. They could not find the vinegar and
decided not to use it, anyway.

[Illustration: They threw themselves down the stairs]

Raggedy Andy stood upon the stove and watched the candy, dipping into it
every once in a while to see if it had cooked long enough, and stirring
it with the large spoon.

At last the candy began to string out from the spoon when it was held
above the stew kettle, and after trying a few drops in a cup of cold
water, Raggedy Andy pronounced it "done."

Uncle Clem pulled out a large platter from the pantry, and Raggedy Ann
dipped her rag hand into the butter jar and buttered the platter.

The candy, when it was poured into the platter, was a lovely golden
color and smelled delicious to the dolls. Henny could not wait until it
cooled; so he put one of his chamois skin hands into the hot candy.

Of course it did not burn Henny, but when he pulled his hand out again,
it was covered with a great ball of candy, which strung out all over the
kitchen floor and got upon his clothes.

Then too, the candy cooled quickly, and in a very short time Henny's
hand was encased in a hard ball of candy. Henny couldn't wiggle any of
his fingers on that hand and he was sorry he had been so hasty.

While waiting for the candy to cool, Raggedy Andy said, "We must rub
butter upon our hands before we pull the candy, or else it will stick to
our hands as it has done to Henny's hands and have to wear off!"

"Will this hard ball of candy have to wear off of my hand?" Henny asked.
"It is so hard, I cannot wiggle any of my fingers!"

"It will either have to wear off, or you will have to soak your hand in
water for a long time, until the candy on it melts!" said Raggedy Andy.

"Dear me!" said Henny.

Uncle Clem brought the poker then and, asking Henny to put his hand upon
the stove leg, he gave the hard candy a few sharp taps with the poker
and chipped the candy from Henny's hand.

"Thank you, Uncle Clem!" Henny said, as he wiggled his fingers. "That
feels much better!"

Raggedy Andy told all the dolls to rub butter upon their hands.

"The candy is getting cool enough to pull!" he said.

Then, when all the dolls had their hands nice and buttery, Raggedy Andy
cut them each a nice piece of candy and showed them how to pull it.

"Take it in one hand this way," he said, "and pull it with the other
hand, like this!"

When all the dolls were supplied with candy they sat about and pulled
it, watching it grow whiter and more silvery the longer they pulled.

Then, when the taffy was real white, it began to grow harder and harder,
so the smaller dolls could scarcely pull it any more.

When this happened, Raggedy Andy, Raggedy Ann, Uncle Clem and Henny, who
were larger, took the little dolls' candy and mixed it with what they
had been pulling until all the taffy was snow white.

[Illustration: The taffy pull]

Then Raggedy Andy pulled it out into a long rope and held it while Uncle
Clem hit the ends a sharp tap with the edge of the spoon.

This snipped the taffy into small pieces, just as easily as you might
break icicles with a few sharp taps of a stick.

The small pieces of white taffy were placed upon the buttered platter
again and the dolls all danced about it, singing and laughing, for this
had been the most fun they had had for a long, long time.

"But what shall we do with it?" Raggedy Ann asked.

"Yes, what shall we do with it!" Uncle Clem said. "We can't let it
remain in the platter here upon the kitchen floor! We must hide it, or
do something with it!"

"While we are trying to think of a way to dispose of it, let us be
washing the stew kettle and the spoon!" said practical Raggedy Ann.

"That is a very happy thought, Raggedy Ann!" said Raggedy Andy. "For it
will clean the butter and candy from our hands while we are doing it!"

So the stew kettle was dragged to the sink and filled with water, the
dolls all taking turns scraping the candy from the sides of the kettle,
and scrubbing the inside with a cloth.

When the kettle was nice and clean and had been wiped dry, Raggedy Andy
found a roll of waxed paper in the pantry upon one of the shelves.

"We'll wrap each piece of taffy in a nice little piece of paper," he
said, "then we'll find a nice paper bag, and put all the pieces inside
the bag, and throw it from the upstairs window when someone passes the
house so that someone may have the candy!"

All the dolls gathered about the platter on the floor, and while Raggedy
Andy cut the paper into neat squares, the dolls wrapped the taffy in the
papers.

Then the taffy was put into a large bag, and with much pulling and
tugging it was finally dragged up into the nursery, where a window faced
out toward the street.

Then, just as a little boy and a little girl, who looked as though they
did not ever have much candy, passed the house, the dolls all gave a
push and sent the bag tumbling to the sidewalk.

The two children laughed and shouted, "Thank you," when they saw that
the bag contained candy, and the dolls, peeping from behind the lace
curtains, watched the two happy faced children eating the taffy as they
skipped down the street.

When the children had passed out of sight, the dolls climbed down from
the window.

"That was lots of fun!" said the French doll, as she smoothed her skirts
and sat down beside Raggedy Andy.

"I believe Raggedy Andy must have a candy heart too, like Raggedy Ann!"
said Uncle Clem.

"No!" Raggedy Andy answered, "I'm just stuffed with white cotton and I
have no candy heart, but some day perhaps I shall have!"

"A candy heart is very nice!" Raggedy Ann said. (You know, she had one.)
"But one can be just as nice and happy and full of sunshine without a
candy heart."

"I almost forgot to tell you," said Raggedy Andy, "that when pieces of
taffy are wrapped in little pieces of paper, just as we wrapped them,
they are called 'Kisses'."

THE RABBIT CHASE


"Well, what shall we play tonight?" asked Henny, the Dutch doll, when
the house was quiet and the dolls all knew that no one else was awake.

Raggedy Andy was just about to suggest a good game, when Fido, who
sometimes slept in a basket in the nursery, growled.

All the dollies looked in his direction.

Fido was standing up with his ears sticking as straight in the air as
loppy silken puppy dog ears can stick up.

"He must have been dreaming!" said Raggedy Andy.

"No, I wasn't dreaming!" Fido answered. "I heard something go, 'Scratch!
Scratch!' as plain as I hear you!"

"Where did the sound come from, Fido?" Raggedy Andy asked when he saw
that Fido really was wide awake.

"From outside somewhere!" Fido answered. "And if I could get out without
disturbing all the folks, I'd run out and see what it might be! Perhaps
I had better bark!"

"Please do not bark!" Raggedy Andy cried as he put his rag arm around
Fido's nose. "You will awaken everybody in the house. We can open a door
or a window for you and let you out, if you must go!"

"I wish you would. Listen! There it is again: 'Scratch! Scratch!' What
can it be?"

"You may soon see!" said Raggedy Andy. "We'll let you out, but please
don't sit at the door and bark and bark to get back in again, as you
usually do, for we are going to play a good game and we may not hear
you!"

"You can sleep out in the shed after you have found out what it is,"
said Raggedy Andy.

As soon as the dolls opened the door for Fido, he went running across
the lawn, barking in a loud shrill voice. He ran down behind the shed
and through the garden, and then back towards the house again.

Raggedy Andy and Uncle Clem stood looking out of the door, the rest of
the dolls peeping over their shoulders, so when something came jumping
through the door, it hit Uncle Clem and Raggedy Andy and sent them
flying against the other dolls behind them.

All the dolls went down in a wiggling heap on the floor.

It was surprising that the noise and confusion did not waken Daddy and
the rest of the folks, for just as the dolls were untangling themselves
from each other and getting upon their feet, Fido came jumping through
the door and sent the dolls tumbling again.

Fido quit barking when he came through the door.

"Which way did he go?" he asked, when he could get his breath.

"What was it?" Raggedy Andy asked in return.

"It was a rabbit!" Fido cried. "He ran right in here, for I could smell
his tracks!"

"We could feel him!" Raggedy Andy laughed.

"I could not tell you which way he went!" Uncle Clem said, "Except I
feel sure he came through the door and into the house!"

None of the dolls knew into which room the rabbit had run.

Finally, after much sniffing, Fido traced the rabbit to the nursery,
where, when the dolls followed, they saw the rabbit crouching behind the
rocking horse.

[Illustration: Looking out of the door]

[Illustration: Raggedy Andy and the rabbit]

Fido whined and cried because he could not get to the rabbit and bite
him.

"You should be ashamed of yourself, Fido!" cried Raggedy Ann. "Just see
how the poor bunny is trembling!"

"He should not come scratching around our house if he doesn't care to be
chased!" said Fido.

"Why don't you stay out in the woods and fields where you really
belong?" Raggedy Andy asked the rabbit.

"I came to leave some Easter eggs!" the bunny answered in a queer little
quavery voice.

"An Easter bunny!" all the dolls cried, jumping about and clapping their
hands. "An Easter bunny!"

"Well!" was all Fido could say, as he sat down and began wagging his
tail.

"You may come out from behind the rocking horse now, Easter bunny!" said
Raggedy Andy. "Fido will not hurt you, now that he knows, will you,
Fido?"

"Indeed I won't!" Fido replied. "I'm sorry that I chased you! And I
remember now, I had to jump over a basket out by the shed! Was that
yours?"

"Yes, it was full of Easter eggs and colored grasses for the little girl
who lives here!" the bunny said.

When the Easter bunny found out that Fido and the dolls were his
friends, he came out from behind the rocking horse and hopped across the
floor to the door.

"I must go see if any of the eggs are broken, for if they are, I will
have to run home and color some more! I was just about to make a nice
nest and put the eggs in it when Fido came bouncing out at me!"

And with a squeeky little laugh the Easter bunny, followed by Fido and
all the dolls, hopped across the lawn towards the shed. There they found
the basket. Four of the lovely colored Easter eggs were broken.

"I will run home and color four more. It will only take a few minutes,
so when I return and scratch again to make a nest, please do not bark at
me!" said the Easter bunny.

[Illustration: The Easter bunny]

"I won't! I promise!" Fido laughed.

"May we go with you and watch you color the Easter eggs?" Raggedy Andy
begged.

"Indeed you may!" the Easter bunny answered. "Can you run fast?"

Then down through the garden and out through a crack in the fence the
Easter bunny hopped, with a long string of dolls trailing behind.

When they came to the Easter bunny's home, they found Mama Easter bunny
and a lot of little teeny weeny bunnies who would some day grow up to be
big Easter bunnies like their Mama and Daddy bunny.

The Easter bunny told them of his adventure with Fido, and all joined in
his laughter when they found it had turned out well at the end.

The Easter bunny put four eggs on to boil and while these were boiling
he mixed up a lot of pretty colors.

When the eggs were boiled, he dipped the four eggs into the pretty
colored dye and then painted lovely flowers on them.

When the Easter bunny had finished painting the eggs he put them in his
basket and, with all the dolls running along beside him, they returned
to the house.

"Why not make the nest right in the nursery?" Raggedy Andy asked.

"That would be just the thing! Then the little girl would wonder and
wonder how I could ever get into the nursery without awakening the rest
of the folks, for she will never suspect that you dolls and Fido let me
in!"

So with Raggedy Andy leading the way, they ran up to the nursery and
there, 'way back in a corner, they watched the Easter bunny make a
lovely nest and put the Easter eggs in it.

And in the morning when Marcella came in to see the dolls you can
imagine her surprise when she found the pretty gift of the Easter
bunny.

"How in the world did the bunny get inside the house and into this room
without awakening Fido?" she laughed.

And Fido, pretending to be asleep, slowly opened one eye and winked over
the edge of his basket at Raggedy Andy.

And Raggedy Andy smiled back at Fido, but never said a word.

[Illustration: How did the bunny get into this room?]

THE NEW TIN GUTTER


All day Saturday the men had worked out upon the eaves of the house and
the dolls facing the window could see them.

The men made quite a lot of noise with their hammers, for they were
putting new gutters around the eaves, and pounding upon tin makes a
great deal of noise.

Marcella had not played with the dolls all that day, for she had gone
visiting; so when the men hammered and made a lot of noise, the dolls
could talk to each other without fear of anyone hearing or knowing they
were really talking to each other.

"What are they doing now?" Raggedy Andy asked.

He was lying with his head beneath a little bed quilt, just as Marcella
had dropped him when she left the nursery; so he could not see what was
going on.

"We can only see the men's legs as they pass the window," answered Uncle
Clem. "But they are putting new shingles or something on the roof!"

After the men had left their work and gone home to supper and the house
was quiet, Raggedy Andy cautiously moved his head out from under the
little bed quilt and, seeing that the coast was clear, sat up.

This was a signal for all the dolls to sit up and smooth out the
wrinkles in their clothes.

[Illustration: Lifting the penny dolls]

The nursery window was open; so Raggedy Andy lifted the penny dolls to
the sill and climbed up beside them.

Leaning out, he could look along the new shiny tin gutter the men had
put in place.

"Here's a grand place to have a lovely slide!" he said as he gave one of
the penny dolls a scoot down the shiny tin gutter.

"Whee! See her go!" Raggedy Andy cried.

All the other dolls climbed upon the window sill beside him.

"Scoot me too!" cried the other little penny doll in her squeeky little
voice, and Raggedy Andy took her in his rag hand and gave her a great
swing which sent her scooting down the shiny tin gutter, "Kerswish!"

Then Raggedy Andy climbed into the gutter himself and, taking a few
steps, spread out his feet and went scooting down the shiny tin.

The other dolls followed his example and scooted along behind him.

When Raggedy Andy came to the place where he expected to find the penny
dolls lying, they were nowhere about.

"Perhaps you scooted them farther than you thought!" Uncle Clem said.

"Perhaps I did!" Raggedy Andy said, "We will look around the bend in the
eave!"

"Oh dear!" he exclaimed when he had peeped around the corner of the
roof, "the gutter ends here and there is nothing but a hole!"

"They must have scooted right into the hole," Henny, the Dutch doll
said.

Raggedy Andy lay flat upon the shiny tin and looked down into the hole.

"Are you down there, penny dolls?" he called.

There was no answer.

"I hope their heads were not broken!" Raggedy Ann said.

[Illustration: In the gutter]

"I'm so sorry I scooted them!" Raggedy Andy cried, as he brushed his
hand over his shoe button eyes.

"Maybe if you hold to my feet, I can reach down the hole and find them
and pull them up again!" he added.

Uncle Clem and Henny each caught hold of a foot of Raggedy Andy and let
him slide down into the hole.

It was a rather tight fit, but Raggedy Andy wiggled and twisted until
all the dolls could see of him were his two feet.

"I can't find them!" he said in muffled tones. "Let me down farther and
I think I'll be able to reach them!"

Now Henny and Uncle Clem thought that Raggedy Andy meant for them to let
go of his feet and this they did.

Raggedy Andy kept wiggling and twisting until he came to a bend in the
pipe and could go no farther.

"I can't find them!" he cried. "They have gone farther down the pipe!
Now you can pull me up!"

"We can't reach you, Raggedy Andy!" Uncle Clem called down the pipe.
"Try to wiggle back up a piece and we will catch your feet and pull you
up!"

Raggedy Andy tried to wiggle backward up the pipe, but his clothes
caught upon a little piece of tin which stuck out from the inside of the
pipe and there he stayed. He could neither go down nor come back up.

"What shall we do?" Uncle Clem cried, "The folks will never find him
down there, for we can not tell them where he is, and they will never
guess it!"

The dolls were all very sad. They stayed out upon the shiny new tin
gutter until it began raining and hoped and hoped that Raggedy Andy
could get back up to them.

Then they went inside the nursery and sat looking out the window until
it was time for the folks to get up and the house to be astir. Then they
went back to the position each had been in, when Marcella had left them.

And although they were very quiet, each one was so sorry to lose Raggedy
Andy, and each felt that he would never be found again.

[Illustration: Down the spout]

"The rain must have soaked his cotton through and through!" sighed
Raggedy Ann. "For all the water from the house runs down the shiny tin
gutters and down the pipe into a rain barrel at the bottom!"

Then Raggedy Ann remembered that there was an opening at the bottom of
the pipe.

"Tomorrow night if we have a chance, we dolls must take a stick and see
if we can reach Raggedy Andy from the bottom of the pipe and pull him
down to us!" she thought.

Marcella came up to the nursery and played all day, watching the rain
patter upon the new tin gutter. She wondered where Raggedy Andy was,
although she did not get worried about him until she had asked Mama
where he might be.

"He must be just where you left him!" Mama said.

"I cannot remember where I left him!" Marcella said.

"I thought he was with all the other dolls in the nursery, though!"

All day Sunday it rained and all of Sunday night, and Monday morning
when Daddy started to work it was still raining.

As Daddy walked out of the front gate, he turned to wave good-bye to
Mama and Marcella and then he saw something.

Daddy came right back into the house and called up the men who had put
in the new shiny tin gutters.

"The drain pipe is plugged up. Some of you must have left shavings or
something in the eaves, and it has washed down into the pipe, so that
the water pours over the gutter in sheets!"

"We will send a man right up to fix it!" the men said.

So along about ten o'clock that morning one of the men came to fix the
pipe.

But although he punched a long pole down the pipe, and punched and
punched, he could not dislodge whatever it was which plugged the pipe
and kept the water from running through it.

[Illustration: Raggedy Ann and the dolls]

[Illustration: The man finds Raggedy Andy]

Then the man measured with his stick, so that he knew just where the
place was, and with a pair of tin shears he cut a section from the pipe
and found Raggedy Andy.

Raggedy Andy was punched quite out of shape and all jammed together, but
when the man straightened out the funny little figure, Raggedy Andy
looked up at him with his customary happy smile.

The man laughed and carried little water-soaked Raggedy Andy into the
house.

"I guess your little girl must have dropped this rag doll down into the
drain pipe!" the man said to Mama.

"I'm so glad you found him!" Mama said to the man.

"We have hunted all over the house for him! Marcella could not remember
where she put him; so when I get him nice and dry, I'll hide him in a
nice easy place for her to find, and she will not know he has been out
in the rain all night!"

So Mama put Raggedy Andy behind the radiator and there he sat all
afternoon, steaming and drying out.

And as he sat there he smiled and smiled, even though there was no one
to see him.

He felt very happy within and he liked to smile, anyway, because his
smile was painted on.

And another reason Raggedy Andy smiled was because he was not lonesome.

Inside his waist were the two little penny dolls.

The man had punched Raggedy Andy farther down into the pipe, and he had
been able to reach the two little dolls and tuck them into a safe place.

"Won't they all be surprised to see us back again!" Raggedy Andy
whispered as he patted the two little penny dolls with his soft rag
hands.

And the two little penny dolls nestled against Raggedy Andy's soft
cotton stuffed body, and thought how nice it was to have such a happy,
sunny friend.

[Illustration: Medicine]

[Illustration: Four dolls]




DOCTOR RAGGEDY ANDY


Raggedy Andy, Raggedy Ann, Uncle Clem and Henny were not given medicine.

Because, you see, they had no mouths.

That is, mouths through which medicine could be poured.

Their mouths were either painted on, or were sewed on with yarn.

Sometimes the medicine spoon would be touched to their faces but none of
the liquid be given them. Except accidentally.

But the French doll had a lovely mouth for taking medicine; it was open
and showed her teeth in a dimpling smile.

She also had soft brown eyes which opened and closed when she was tilted
backward or forward.

The medicine which was given the dolls had great curing properties.

It would cure the most stubborn case of croup, measles, whooping cough
or any other ailment the dolls had wished upon them by their little
Mistress.

Some days all the dolls would be put to bed with "measles" but in the
course of half an hour they would have every other ailment in the Doctor
book.

The dolls enjoyed it very much, for, you see, Marcella always tried the
medicine first to see if it was strong enough before she gave any to the
dolls.

[Illustration: Bandaged up]

So the dolls really did not get as much of the medicine as their little
mistress.

The wonderful remedy was made from a very old recipe handed down from
ancient times.

This recipe is guaranteed to cure every ill a doll may have.

The medicine was made from brown sugar and water. Perhaps you may have
used it for your dollies.

The medicine was also used as "tea" and "soda water," except when the
dolls were supposed to be ill.

Having nothing but painted or yarn mouths, the ailments of Raggedy Andy,
Raggedy Ann, Uncle Clem and Henny, the Dutch doll, mostly consisted of
sprained wrists, arms and legs, or perhaps a headache and a toothache.

None of them knew they had the trouble until Marcella had wrapped up the
"injured" rag arm, leg or head, and had explained in detail just what
was the matter.

Raggedy Andy, Raggedy Ann, Uncle Clem, or Henny were just as happy with
their heads tied up for the toothache as they were without their heads
tied up.

Not having teeth, naturally they could not have the toothache, and if
they could furnish amusement for Marcella by having her pretend they had
the toothache, then that made them very happy.

So this day, the French doll was quite ill. She started out with the
"croup," and went through the "measles," "whooping cough," and "yellow
fever" in an hour.

The attack came on quite suddenly.

The French doll was sitting quietly in one of the little red chairs,
smiling the prettiest of dimpling smiles at Raggedy Andy, and thinking
of the romp the dolls would have that night after the house grew quiet,
when Marcella discovered that the French doll had the "croup" and put
her to bed.

The French doll closed her eyes when put to bed, but the rest of her
face did not change expression. She still wore her happy smile.

[Illustration: Marcella caring for the sick]

Marcella mixed the medicine very "strong" and poured it into the French
doll's open mouth.

She was given a "dose" every minute or so.

It was during the "yellow fever" stage that Marcella was called to
supper and left the dolls in the nursery alone.

Marcella did not play with them again that evening; so the dolls all
remained in the same position until Marcella and the rest of the folks
went to bed.

Then Raggedy Andy jumped from his chair and wound up the little music
box. "Let's start with a lively dance!" he cried.

When the music started tinkling he caught the French doll's hand, and
danced 'way across the nursery floor before he discovered that her soft
brown eyes remained closed as they were when she lay upon the "sick"
bed.

All the dolls gathered around Raggedy Andy and the French doll.

"I can't open my eyes!" she said.

Raggedy Andy tried to open the French doll's eyes with his soft rag
hands, but it was no use.

They shook her. This sometimes has the desired effect when dolls do not
open their eyes.

They shook her again and again. It was no use, her eyes remained closed.

"It must be the sticky, sugary 'medicine'!" said Uncle Clem.

"I really believe it must be!" the French doll replied. "The 'medicine'
seemed to settle in the back of my head when I was lying down, and I can
still feel it back there!"

"That must be it, and now it has hardened and keeps your pretty eyes
from working!" said Raggedy Ann. "What shall we do?"

Raggedy Andy and Raggedy Ann walked over to a corner of the nursery and
thought and thought. They pulled their foreheads down into wrinkles with
their hands, so that they might think harder.

[Illustration: Raggedy Andy winds the music box]

Finally Raggedy Ann cried, "I've thought of a plan!" and went skipping
from the corner out to where the other dolls sat about the French doll.

"We must stand her upon her head, then the 'medicine' will run up into
her hair, for there is a hole in the top of her head. I remember seeing
it when her hair came off one time!"

"No sooner said than done!" cried Uncle Clem, as he took the French doll
by the waist and stood her upon her head.

"That should be long enough!" Raggedy Ann said, when Uncle Clem had held
the French doll in this position for five minutes.

But when the French doll was again placed upon her feet her eyes still
remained tightly closed.

All this time, Raggedy Andy had remained in the corner, thinking as hard
as his rag head would think.

He thought and thought, until the yarn hair upon his head stood up in
the air and wiggled.

"If the 'medicine' did not run up into her hair when she stood upon her
head," thought Raggedy Andy, "then it is because the 'medicine' could
not run; so, if the medicine can not run, it is because it is too sticky
and thick to run out the hole in the top of her head." He also thought a
lot more.

At last he turned to the others and said out loud, "I can't seem to
think of a single way to help her open her eyes unless we take off her
hair and wash the medicine from inside her china head."

"Why didn't I think of that?" Raggedy Ann asked. "That is just the way
we shall have to do!"

So Raggedy Ann caught hold of the French doll's feet, and Raggedy Andy
caught hold of the French doll's lively curls, and they pulled and they
pulled.

Then the other dolls caught hold of Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy and
pulled and pulled, until finally, with a sharp "R-R-Rip!" the French
doll's hair came off, and the dolls who were pulling went tumbling over
backwards.

[Illustration: Shaking the French doll upside down]

[Illustration: Hole in her head]

Laughingly they scrambled to their feet and sat the French doll up, so
they might look into the hole in the top of her head.

Yes, the sticky "medicine" had grown hard and would not let the French
doll's eyes open.

Raggedy Andy put his hand inside and pushed on the eyes so that they
opened.

This was all right, only now the eyes would not close when the French
doll lay down. She tried it.

So Raggedy Andy ran down into the kitchen and brought up a small tin cup
full of warm water and a tiny rag.

With these he loosened the sticky "medicine" and washed the inside of
the French doll's head nice and clean.

There were lots of cooky and cracker crumbs inside her head, too.

Raggedy Andy washed it all nice and clean, and then wet the glue which
made the pretty curls stay on.

So when her hair was placed upon her head again, the French doll was as
good as new.

"Thank you all very much!" she said, as she tilted backwards and
forwards, and found that her eyes worked very easily.

Raggedy Andy again wound up the little music box and, catching the
French doll about the waist, started a rollicking dance which lasted
until the roosters in the neighborhood began their morning crowing.

Then, knowing the folks might soon be astir, the dolls left off their
playing, and all took the same positions they had been in when Marcella
left them the night before.

And so Marcella found them.

The French doll was in bed with her eyes closed, and her happy dimpling
smile lighting up her pretty face.

And to this day, the dollies' little mistress does not know that Raggedy
Andy was the doctor who cured the French doll of her only ill.

[Illustration: Raggedy Andy dancing with the French doll]

[Illustration: Dickie and Raggedy Andy]

[Illustration: Where is Raggedy Andy's smile?]




RAGGEDY ANDY'S SMILE


Raggedy Andy's smile was gone.

Not entirely, but enough so that it made his face seem onesided.

If one viewed Raggedy Andy from the left side, one could see his smile.

But if one looked at Raggedy Andy from the right side, one could not see
his smile. So Raggedy Andy's smile was gone.

It really was not Raggedy Andy's fault.

He felt just as happy and sunny as ever.

And perhaps would not have known the difference had not the other dolls
told him he had only one half of his cheery smile left.

Nor was it Marcella's fault. How was she to know that Dickie would feed
Raggedy Andy orange juice and take off most of his smile?

And besides taking off one half of Raggedy Andy's smile, the orange
juice left a great brown stain upon his face.

Marcella was very sorry when she saw what Dickie had done.

Dickie would have been sorry, too, if he had been more than two years
old, but when one is only two years old, he has very few sorrows.

Dickie's only sorrow was that Raggedy Andy was taken from him, and he
could not feed Raggedy Andy more orange juice.

Marcella kissed Raggedy Andy more than she did the rest of the dolls
that night, when she put them to bed, and this made all the dolls very
happy.

It always gave them great pleasure when any of their number was hugged
and kissed, for there was not a selfish doll among them.

Marcella hung up a tiny stocking for each of the dollies, and placed a
tiny little china dish for each of the penny dolls beside their little
spool box bed.

For, as you probably have guessed, it was Christmas eve, and Marcella
was in hopes Santa Claus would see the tiny stockings and place
something in them for each dollie.

Then when the house was very quiet, the French doll told Raggedy Andy
that most of his smile was gone.

"Indeed!" said Raggedy Andy. "I can still feel it! It must be there!"

"Oh, but it really is gone!" Uncle Clem said. "It was the orange juice!"

"Well, I still feel just as happy," said Raggedy Andy, "so let's have a
jolly game of some sort! What shall it be?"

"Perhaps we had best try to wash your face!" said practical Raggedy Ann.
She always acted as a mother to the other dolls when they were alone.

"It will not do a bit of good!" the French doll told Raggedy Ann, "for I
remember I had orange juice spilled upon a nice white frock I had one
time, and the stain would never come out!"

"That is too bad!" Henny, the Dutch doll, said. "We shall miss Raggedy
Andy's cheery smile when he is looking straight at us!"

"You will have to stand on my right side, when you wish to see my
smile!" said Raggedy Andy, with a cheery little chuckle 'way down in his
soft cotton inside.

[Illustration: Raggedy Andy's lopsided smile]

[Illustration: Santa]

"But I wish everyone to understand," he went on, "that I am smiling just
the same, whether you can see it or not!"

And with this, Raggedy Andy caught hold of Uncle Clem and Henny, and
made a dash for the nursery door, followed by all the other dolls.

Raggedy Andy intended jumping down the stairs, head over heels, for he
knew that neither he, Uncle Clem nor Henny would break anything by
jumping down stairs.

But just as they got almost to the door, they dropped to the floor in a
heap, for there, standing watching the whole performance, was a man.

All the dolls fell in different attitudes, for it would never do for
them to let a real person see that they could act and talk just like
real people.

Raggedy Andy, Uncle Clem and Henny stopped so suddenly they fell over
each other and Raggedy Andy, being in the lead and pulling the other
two, slid right through the door and stopped at the feet of the man.

A cheery laugh greeted this and a chubby hand reached down and picked up
Raggedy Andy and turned him over.

Raggedy Andy looked up into a cheery little round face, with a little
red nose and red cheeks, and all framed in white whiskers which looked
just like snow.

Then the little round man walked into the nursery and picked up all the
dolls and looked at them. He made no noise when he walked, and this was
why he had taken the dolls by surprise at the head of the stairs.

The little man with the snow-white whiskers placed all the dolls in a
row and from a little case in his pocket he took a tiny bottle and a
little brush. He dipped the little brush in the tiny bottle and touched
all the dolls' faces with it.

He had purposely saved Raggedy Andy's face until the last. Then, as all
the dolls watched, the cheery little white-whiskered man touched Raggedy
Andy's face with the magic liquid, and the orange juice stain
disappeared, and in its place came Raggedy Andy's rosy cheeks and cheery
smile.

[Illustration: Santa repairs Raggedy Andy]

And, turning Raggedy Andy so that he could face all the other dolls, the
cheery little man showed him that all the other dolls had new rosy
cheeks and newly-painted faces. They all looked just like new dollies.
Even Susan's cracked head had been made whole.

Henny, the Dutch doll, was so surprised he fell over backward and said,
"Squeek!"

When the cheery little man with the white whiskers heard this, he picked
Henny up and touched him with the paint brush in the center of the back,
just above the place where Henny had the little mechanism which made him
say "Mama" when he was new. And when the little man touched Henny and
tipped him forward and backward, Henny was just as good as new and said
"Mama" very prettily.

Then the little man put something in each of the tiny doll stockings,
and something in each of the little china plates for the two penny
dolls.

Then, as quietly as he had entered, he left, merely turning at the door
and shaking his finger at the dolls in a cheery, mischievous manner.

Raggedy Andy heard him chuckling to himself as he went down the stairs.

Raggedy Andy tiptoed to the door and over to the head of the stairs.

Then he motioned for the other dolls to come.

There, from the head of the stairs, they watched the cheery little
white-whiskered man take pretty things from a large sack and place them
about the chimneyplace.

"He does not know that we are watching him," the dolls all thought, but
when the little man had finished his task, he turned quickly and laughed
right up at the dolls, for he had known that they were watching him all
the time.

Then, again shaking his finger at them in his cheery manner, the little
white-whiskered man swung the sack to his shoulder, and with a whistle
such as the wind makes when it plays through the chinks of a window, he
was gone--up the chimney.

The dolls were very quiet as they walked back into the nursery and sat
down to think it all over, and as they sat there thinking, they heard
out in the night the "tinkle, tinkle, tinkle" of tiny sleigh bells,
growing fainter and fainter as they disappeared in the distance.

Without a word, but filled with a happy wonder, the dolls climbed into
their beds, just as Marcella had left them, and pulled the covers up to
their chins.

And Raggedy Andy lay there, his little shoe button eyes looking straight
towards the ceiling and smiling a joyful smile--not a "half smile" this
time, but a "full size smile."

[Illustration: Raggedy Andy smiling a joyful smile]

[Illustration: Raggedy Andy and the Wooden Horse]

[Illustration: Santa leaves the Wooden Horse]




THE WOODEN HORSE


Santa Claus left a whole lot of toys.

A wooden horse, covered with canton flannel and touched lightly with a
paint brush dipped in black paint to give him a dappled gray appearance,
was one of the presents.

With the wooden horse came a beautiful red wagon with four yellow
wheels. My! The paint was pretty and shiny.

The wooden horse was hitched to the wagon with a patent leather harness;
and he, himself, stood proudly upon a red platform running on four
little nickel wheels.

It was true that the wooden horse's eyes were as far apart as a camel's
and made him look quite like one when viewed from in front, but he had
soft leather ears and a silken mane and tail.

He was nice to look upon, was the wooden horse. All the dolls patted him
and smoothed his silken mane and felt his shiny patent leather harness
the first night they were alone with him in the nursery.

The wooden horse had a queer voice; the dolls could hardly understand
him at first, but when his bashfulness wore off, he talked quite
plainly.

"It is the first time I have ever tried to talk," he explained when he
became acquainted, "and I guess I was talking down in my stomach instead
of my head!"

"You will like it here in the nursery very much!" said Raggedy Andy. "We
have such jolly times and love each other so much I know you will enjoy
your new home!"

"I am sure I shall!" the wooden horse answered. "Where I came from,
we--the other horses and myself--just stood silently upon the shelves
and looked and looked straight ahead, and never so much as moved our
tails."

"See if you can move your tail now!" Henny, the Dutch doll, suggested.

The wooden horse started to roll across the nursery floor and if Raggedy
Ann had not been in the way, he might have bumped into the wall. As it
was, the wooden horse rolled against Raggedy Ann and upset her but could
go no further when his wheels ran against her rag foot.

When the wooden horse upset Raggedy Ann, he stood still until Uncle Clem
and Henny and Raggedy Andy lifted him off Raggedy Ann's feet. "Did I
frisk my tail?" he asked when Raggedy Ann stood up and smoothed her
apron.

"Try it again!" said Raggedy Ann. "I couldn't see!" She laughed her
cheery rag doll laugh, for Raggedy Ann, no matter what happened, never
lost her temper.

The wooden horse started rolling backward at this and knocked Henny over
upon his back, causing him to cry "Mama!" in his squeeky voice.

Uncle Clem, Raggedy Ann, and the tin soldier all held to the wooden
horse and managed to stop him just as he was backing out of the nursery
door towards the head of the stairs.

Then the dolls pulled the wooden horse back to the center of the room.
"It's funny" he said, "that I start moving backward or forward when I
try to frisk my tail!"

"I believe it is because you have stood so long upon the shelf without
moving," Raggedy Andy suggested. "Suppose you try moving forward!"

Uncle Clem, who was standing in front of the wooden horse, jumped to one
side so hastily his feet slipped out from under him, just as if he had
been sliding upon slippery ice.

[Illustration: The wooden horse rolled over Raggedy Ann's foot]

[Illustration: The wooden horse and the dolls]

The wooden horse did not start moving forward as Uncle Clem had
expected; instead, his silken tail frisked gaily up over his back.

"Whee! There, you frisked your tail!" cried all the dolls as joyfully as
if the wooden horse had done something truly wonderful.

"It's easy now!" said the wooden horse. "When I wish to go forward or
backward I'll try to frisk my tail and then I'll roll along on my shiny
wheels; then when I wish to frisk my tail I'll try to roll forward or
backward, like this!" But instead of rolling forward, the wooden horse
frisked his tail. "I wanted to frisk my tail then!" he said in surprise.
"Now I'll roll forward!" And sure enough, the wooden horse rolled across
the nursery floor.

When he started rolling upon his shiny wheels, Raggedy Andy cried, "All
aboard!" and, taking a short run, he leaped upon the wooden horse's
back. Uncle Clem, Raggedy Ann, Henny, the Dutch doll and Susan, the doll
without a head, all scrambled up into the pretty red wagon.

The wooden horse thought this was great fun and round and round the
nursery he circled. His shiny wheels and the pretty yellow wheels of the
red wagon creaked so loudly none of the dolls heard the cries of the
tiny penny dolls who were too small to climb aboard. Finally, as the
wagon load of dolls passed the penny dolls, Raggedy Andy noticed the two
little midgets standing together and missing the fun; so, leaning 'way
over to one side as the horse swept by them, Raggedy Andy caught both
the penny dolls in his strong rag arms and lifted them to a seat upon
the broad back of the wooden horse.

"Hooray!" cried all the dolls when they saw Raggedy Andy's feat. "It was
just like a Wild West Show!"

"We must all have all the fun we can together!" said Raggedy Andy.

"Good for you!" cried Uncle Clem. "The more fun we can give each other,
the more fun each one of us will have!"

[Illustration: Raggedy Andy and the penny dolls went clear over his
head]

The wooden horse made the circle of the nursery a great many times, for
it pleased him very much to hear the gay laughter of the dolls and he
thought to himself, "How happy I will be, living with such a jolly
crowd."

But just as he was about to pass the door, there was a noise upon the
stairs and the wooden horse, hearing it, stopped so suddenly Raggedy
Andy and the penny dolls went clear over his head and the dolls in the
front of the wagon took Raggedy Andy's seat upon the horse's back.

They lay just as they fell, for they did not wish anyone to suspect that
they could move or talk.

"Ha! Ha! Ha! I knew you were having a lot of fun!" cried a cheery voice.

At this, all the dolls immediately scrambled back into their former
places, for they recognized the voice of the French dollie.

But what was their surprise to see her dressed in a lovely fairy
costume, her lovely curls flying out behind, as she ran towards them.

Raggedy Andy was just about to climb upon the horse's back again when
the French doll leaped there herself and, balancing lightly upon one
foot, stood in this position while the wooden horse rolled around the
nursery as fast as he could go.

Raggedy Andy and the two penny dolls ran after the wagon and, with the
assistance of Uncle Clem and Raggedy Ann, climbed up in back.

When the wooden horse finally stopped the dolls all said, "This is the
most fun we have had for a _long_ time!"

The wooden horse, a thrill of happiness running through his wooden body,
cried, "It is the most fun I have _ever_ had!"

And the dolls, while they did not tell him so, knew that he had had the
most fun because he had given _them_ the most pleasure.

For, as you must surely know, they who are the most unselfish are the
ones who gain the greatest joy; because they give happiness to others.

MAKING "ANGELS" IN THE SNOW


"Whee! It's good to be back home again!" said Raggedy Andy to the other
dolls, as he stretched his feet out in front of the little toy stove and
rubbed his rag hands briskly together, as if to warm them.

All the dolls laughed at Raggedy Andy for doing this, for they knew
there had never been a fire in the little toy stove in all the time it
had been in the nursery. And that was a long time.

"We are so glad and happy to have you back home again with us!" the
dolls told Raggedy Andy. "For we have missed you very, very much!"

"Well," Raggedy Andy replied, as he held his rag hands over the tiny lid
of the stove and rubbed them again, "I have missed all of you, too, and
wished many times that you had been with me to join in and share in the
pleasures and frolics I've had."

And as Raggedy Andy continued to hold his hands over the little stove,
Uncle Clem asked him why he did it.

Raggedy Andy smiled and leaned back in his chair. "Really," he said, "I
wasn't paying any attention to what I was doing! I've spent so much of
my time while I was away drying out my soft cotton stuffing it seems as
though it has almost become a habit."

"Were you wet most of the time, Raggedy Andy?" the French doll asked.

"Nearly all the time!" Raggedy Andy replied. "First I would get sopping
wet and then I'd freeze!"

"Freeze!" exclaimed all the dolls in one breath.

"Dear me, yes!" Raggedy Andy laughed. "Just see here!" And Raggedy Andy
pulled his sleeve up and showed where his rag arm had been mended. "That
was quite a rip!" he smiled.

"Dear! Dear! How in the world did it happen? On a nail?" Henny, the
Dutch doll, asked as he put his arm about Raggedy Andy.

"Froze!" said Raggedy Andy.

The dolls gathered around Raggedy Andy and examined the rip in his rag
arm.

"It's all right now!" he laughed. "But you should have seen me when it
happened! I was frozen into one solid cake of ice all the way through,
and when Marcella tried to limber up my arm before it had thawed out, it
went, 'Pop!' and just bursted.

"Then I was placed in a pan of nice warm water until the icy cotton
inside me had melted, and then I was hung up on a line above the kitchen
stove, out at Gran'ma's."

"But how did you happen to get so wet and then freeze?" asked Raggedy
Ann.

"Out across the road from Gran'ma's home, 'way out in the country, there
is a lovely pond," Raggedy Andy explained. "In the summer time pretty
flowers grow about the edge, the little green frogs sit upon the pond
lilies and beat upon their tiny drums all through the night, and the
twinkling stars wink at their reflections in the smooth water. But when
Marcella and I went out to Gran'ma's, last week, Gran'ma met us with a
sleigh, for the ground was covered with starry snow. The pretty pond was
covered with ice, too, and upon the ice was a soft blanket of the white,
white snow. It was beautiful!" said Raggedy Andy.

[Illustration: Marcella and Raggedy Andy in the snow]

[Illustration: Marcella on a sled]

"Gran'ma had a lovely new sled for Marcella, a red one with shiny
runners.

"And after we had visited Gran'ma a while, we went to the pond for a
slide.

"It was heaps of fun, for there was a little hill at one end of the pond
so that when we coasted down, we went scooting across the pond like an
arrow.

"Marcella would turn the sled sideways, just for fun, and she and I
would fall off and go sliding across the ice upon our backs, leaving a
clean path of ice, where we pushed aside the snow as we slid. Then
Marcella showed me how to make 'angels' in the soft snow!"

"Oh, tell us how, Raggedy Andy!" shouted all the dollies.

"It's very easy!" said Raggedy Andy. "Marcella would lie down upon her
back in the snow and put her hands back up over her head, then she would
bring her hands in a circle down to her sides, like this." And Raggedy
Andy lay upon the floor of the nursery and showed the dollies just how
it was done. "Then," he added, "when she stood up it would leave the
print of her body and legs in the white, white snow, and where she had
swooped her arms there were the 'angel's wings!'"

"It must have looked just like an angel!" said Uncle Clem.

"Indeed it was very pretty!" Raggedy Andy answered. "Then Marcella made
a lot of 'angels' by placing me in the snow and working my arms; so you
see, what with falling off the sled so much and making so many 'angels,'
we both were wet, but I was completely soaked through. My cotton just
became soppy and I was ever so much heavier! Then Gran'ma, just as we
were having a most delightful time, came to the door and 'Ooh-hooed' to
Marcella to come and get a nice new doughnut. So Marcella, thinking to
return in a minute, left me lying upon the sled and ran through the snow
to Gran'ma's. And there I stayed and stayed until I began to feel stiff
and could hear the cotton inside me go, 'Tic! Tic!' as it began to
freeze.

[Illustration: Raggedy Andy on a sled at night]

"I lay upon the sled until after the sun went down. Two little Chicadees
came and sat upon the sled and talked to me in their cute little bird
language, and I watched the sky in the west get golden red, then turn
into a deep crimson purple and finally a deep blue, as the sun went
farther down around the bend of the earth. After it had been dark for
some time, I heard someone coming through the snow and could see the
yellow light of a lantern. It was Gran'ma.

"She pulled the sled over in back of her house and did not see that I
was upon it until she turned to go in the kitchen; then she picked me up
and took me inside. 'He's frozen as stiff as a board!' she told Marcella
as she handed me to her. Marcella did not say why she had forgotten to
come for me, but I found out afterward that it was because she was so
wet. Gran'ma made her change her clothes and shoes and stockings and
would not permit her to go out and play again.

"Well, anyway," concluded Raggedy Andy, "Marcella tried to limber my arm
and, being almost solid ice, it just burst. And that is the way it went
all the time we were out at Gran'ma's; I was wet nearly all the time.
But I wish you could all have been with me to share in the fun."

And Raggedy Andy again leaned over the little toy stove and rubbed his
rag hands briskly together.

Uncle Clem went to the waste paper basket and came back with some scraps
of yellow and red paper. Then, taking off one of the tiny lids, he
stuffed the paper in part of the way as if the flames were "shooting
up!"

Then, as all the dolls' merry laughter rang out, Raggedy Andy stopped
rubbing his hands, and catching Raggedy Ann about the waist, he went
skipping across the nursery floor with her, whirling so fast neither saw
they had gone out through the door until it was too late. For coming to
the head of the stairs, they both went head over heels, "blumpity,
blump!" over and over, until they wound up, laughing, at the bottom.

"Last one up is a Cocoa baby!" cried Raggedy Ann, as she scrambled to
her feet. And with her skirts in her rag hands she went racing up the
stairs to where the rest of the dollies stood laughing.

"Hurrah, for Raggedy Ann!" cried Raggedy Andy generously. "She won!"

[Illustration: The Singing Shell]




THE SINGING SHELL


For years and years the beautiful shell had been upon the floor in
Gran'ma's front room. It was a large shell with many points upon it.
These were coarse and rough, but the shell was most beautiful inside.

Marcella had seen the shell time and time again and often admired its
lovely coloring, which could be seen when one looked inside the shell.

So one day, Gran'ma gave the beautiful shell to Marcella to have for her
very own, up in the nursery.

"It will be nice to place before the nursery door so the wind will not
blow the door to and pinch anyone's fingers!" Gran'ma laughed.

So Marcella brought the shell home and placed it in front of the nursery
door. Here the dolls saw it that night, when all the house was still,
and stood about it wondering what kind of toy it might be.

"It seems to be nearly all mouth!" said Henny, the Dutch doll. "Perhaps
it can talk."

"It has teeth!" the French doll pointed out. "It may bite!"

"I do not believe it will bite," Raggedy Andy mused, as he got down upon
his hands and knees and looked up into the shell. "Marcella would not
have it up here if it would bite!" And, saying this, Raggedy Andy put
his rag arm into the lovely shell's mouth.

"It doesn't bite! I knew it wouldn't!" he cried. "Just feel how smooth
it is inside!"

All the dolls felt and were surprised to find it polished so highly
inside, while the outside was so coarse and rough. With the help of
Uncle Clem and Henny, Raggedy Andy turned the shell upon its back, so
that all the dolls might look in.

The coloring consisted of dainty pinks, creamy whites and pale blues,
all running together just as the coloring in an opal runs from one shade
into another. Raggedy Andy, stooping over to look further up inside the
pretty shell, heard something.

"It's whispering!" he said, as he raised up in surprise.

All the dolls took turns putting their ears to the mouth of the
beautiful shell. Yes, truly it whispered, but they could not catch just
what it said.

Finally Raggedy Andy suggested that all the dolls lie down upon the
floor directly before the shell and keep very quiet.

"If we don't make a sound we may be able to hear what it says!" he
explained.

So the dolls lay down, placing themselves flat upon the floor directly
in front of the shell and where they could see and admire its beautiful
coloring.

Now the dolls could be very, very quiet when they really wished to be,
and it was easy for them to hear the faint whispering of the shell.

This is the story the shell told the dolls in the nursery that night:

"A long, long time ago, I lived upon the yellow sand, deep down beneath
the blue, blue waters of the ocean. Pretty silken sea weeds grew around
my home and reached their waving branches up, up towards the top of the
water.

[Illustration: Everyone listens]

"Through the pretty sea weeds, fishes of pretty colors and shapes darted
here and there, playing at their games.

"It was still and quiet 'way down where I lived, for even if the ocean
roared and pounded itself into an angry mass of tumbling waves up above,
this never disturbed the calm waters down where I lived.

"Many times, little fishes or other tiny sea people came and hid within
my pretty house when they were being pursued by larger sea creatures.
And it always made me very happy to give them this protection.

"They would stay inside until I whispered that the larger creature had
gone, then they would leave me and return to their play.

"Pretty little sea horses with slender, curving bodies often went
sailing above me, or would come to rest upon my back. It was nice to lie
and watch the tiny things curl their little tails about the sea weed and
talk together, for the sea horses like one another and are gentle and
kind to each other, sharing their food happily and smoothing their
little ones with their cunning noses.

"But one day a diver leaped over the side of a boat and came swimming
head-first down, down to where I lay. My! How the tiny sea creatures
scurried to hide from him. He took me within his hand and, giving his
feet a thump upon the yellow sand, rose with me to the surface.

"He poured the water from me, and out came all the little creatures who
had been hiding there!"

Raggedy Andy wiggled upon the floor, he was so interested.

"Did the tiny creatures get back into the water safely?" he asked the
beautiful shell.

"Oh, yes!" the shell whispered in reply. "The man held me over the side
of the boat, so the tiny creatures went safely back into the water!"

"I am so glad!" Raggedy Andy said, with a sigh of relief. "He must have
been a kindly man!"

"Yes, indeed!" the beautiful shell replied. "So I was placed along with
a lot of other shells in the bottom of the boat and every once in a
while another shell was placed amongst us. We whispered together and
wondered where we were going. We were finally sold to different people
and I have been at Gran'ma's house for a long, long time."

"You lived there when Gran'ma was a little girl, didn't you?" Raggedy
Ann asked.

"Yes," replied the shell, "I have lived there ever since Gran'ma was a
little girl. She often used to play with me and listen to me sing."

"Raggedy Ann can play 'Peter, Peter, Pumpkin Eater' on the piano, with
one hand," said Uncle Clem, "but none of us can sing. Will you sing for
us?" he asked the shell.

"I sing all the time," the shell replied, "for I cannot help singing,
but my singing is a secret and so is very soft and low. Put your head
close to the opening in my shell and listen!"

The dolls took turns doing this, and heard the shell sing softly and
very sweetly.

"How strange and far away it sounds!" exclaimed the French doll. "Like
fairies singing in the distance! The shell must be singing the songs of
the mermaids and the water-fairies!"

"It is queer that anything so rough on the outside could be so pretty
within!" said Raggedy Andy. "It must be a great pleasure to be able to
sing so sweetly!"

"Indeed it is," replied the beautiful shell, "and I get a great
happiness from singing all the time."

"And you will bring lots of pleasure to us, by being so happy!" said
Raggedy Andy. "For although you may not enter into our games, we will
always know that you are happily singing, and that will make us all
happy!"

"I will tell you the secret of my singing," said the shell. "When anyone
puts his ear to me and listens, he hears the reflection of his own
heart's music, singing; so, you see, while I say that I am singing all
the time, in reality I sing only when someone full of happiness hears
his own singing as if it were mine."

"How unselfish you are to say this!" said Raggedy Andy. "Now we are ever
so much more glad to have you with us. Aren't we?" he asked, turning to
the rest of the dolls.

"Yes, indeed!" came the answer from all the dolls, even the tiny penny
dolls.

"That is why the shell is so beautiful inside!" said Raggedy Ann. "Those
who are unselfish may wear rough clothes, but inside they are always
beautiful, just like the shell, and reflect to others the happiness and
sunny music within their hearts!"

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

ALKULAUSE.


Täten lasken julkisuuteen teoksen, jonka alkuainekset jo ehkä pari
vuosikymmentä ovat kehäilleet mielessäni. Olen tuntenut
kansallisena onnettomuutena kielellisen kahtiajaottumisemme, olen
siinä nähnyt useimpain sivistyksellisten ja kansallisten
vajanaisuuksiemme juuret ja selityksen. Olen nähnyt erikielisten
ryhmiemme kuin itsetiedottomuuden sokeudessa yhä laventavan sitä
kuilua, joka kummankin menestykseksi päinvastoin olisi saatava--jos
ei täytetyksi--niin ainakin silloitetuksi ja käytännöllisesti
vaarattomaksi.--Varsinkin ruotsinkielinen kansalaisryhmämme on
tässä eristäytymisessä joutunut jo tuhoisan pitkälle, ja on
tämä eristäytymispyrkimys eräille sen vaikuttaville piireille
muodostunut aivan ohjelmalliseksi päämaaliksi. Etenkin
ruotsinkielinen nuorisomme--kasvaneena kodeissa ja ympäristössä,
jossa suomalaisuuden halpeleminen ja ynsiminen on ollut, jos ei
suoranaisena, tunnustettuna teoreettisena ohjelmana, niin ainakin
käytännöllisenä ilmakehänä, jokapäiväisenä henkisenä
leipänä--tämä nuoriso etenkin on tästä veriinsä eletystä
halveksumisesta ja vieroksumisesta vetänyt kansallisohjelmalliset
johtopäätökset ja on nyt isäinsä hengen johdonmukainen
toteuttaja. Jos eräät keski-ikäiset ja sitä vanhemmat ruotsikkomme
jonkun verran epäillen pudistelevat päitään nuorisonsa
erinäisille ruotsalaisuus-intoilun räikeimmille ilmauksille, niin
ovat ne silti täydessä henkisessä edesvastuussa niistä.

Kun nyt tällainen kansallinen suhtautuminen käsitysteni mukaan
perustuu täydelliseen kansalliseen ja sivistykselliseen näköharhaan
ja kun se seurauksissaan saattaa vaaraan kansamme sivistyksellisen
sekä menneisyyden että tulevaisuuden, niin olen jo kauan tuntenut
tarpeen valaista kansallisia olosuhteitamme siltä kannalta kuin ne
minulle näkyvät. Olen tuntenut ikäänkuin
kansalaisvelvollisuudekseni koettaa osaltani tehdä voitavani sen
sivistyksellisen ja kansallisen vaaran torjumiseksi, jonka
turmiollisuuden niin elävästi tunnen ja näen.

Jos käsittelyni pääasiassa tulee olemaan kielteinen, johtuu se
luonnollisesti siitä, että esitykseni tarkoituksena juuri on
valaista kansallisen kahtioitumisemme tuhoisuutta ja että sen
tähtäyslinjaan senvuoksi lankeavat juuri tämän lohkoutumisen
aiheuttamat sivistyksemme vajanaisuudet ja heikkoudet.

osanotto ovat tehokkaasti vaikuttaneet teokseni monipuolistumiseen ja
muodolliseen selkenemiseen.

KANSALLISTEN KÄSITTEIDEN SELVITTELYÄ




       *       *       *       *       *

Epäilen, että kansoja kuten ihmisiäkin toisinaan johtavat luulot,
harhautuneet käsitykset siitä, mikä on oma sisäinen pyrkimys.
Kuten yksityisellä ihmiselämällä saattaa kansallakin joskus olla
kriisikautensa, ajankohta, jolloin joku vaihe sen kehityksessä on
saavuttanut huippunsa ja kypsyytensä ja jolloin kansaelimistössä on
pyrkimys, paisuva tarve vuolahtamaan uusille urille, hakemaan uutta
ilmenemis- ja toteutumismuotoa sisäiselle, alati vireessä olevalle
muodostumistarpeelleen, elämäntarpeelleen.

Tällainen ajankohta on tavallisesti sisäisen tyytymättömyyden,
risteilevien, etsivien, taistelevien pyrkimyksien aikaa. On kuin
kansan sielu olisi käymistilassa, tulvehtimistilassa, hakisi uomaa,
ulospääsyuraa patoutuneille voimilleen, hyökyisi sokeassa,
itsetiedottomassa etsinnässä aivan ristiriitaisillekin,
vastakkaisille tahoille. Tällaisena ajankohtana saattaa sisäisessä
kuohunnassaan itsetiedoton, seestymätön kansan sielu vuolahtaa
harhateille, saattaa eksyä, murtautua väärään uomaan:
kiihtyneesti, ärtyneesti muodostumisaltis ja -valmis yleinen mieliala
voi saada sytytyksensä väärästä herätyssanasta, voi kiteytyä
väärien, umpimähkäisen sattuman sen tielle viskaamien johtosanojen
ympärille ja voi näiden hetkellisesti harhauttamana tuokioksi
hairahtua oman sisäisen laatunsa suunnasta, oman kehityksensä ja
historiansa syvästä pohjavirrasta, voi eksyä pitkille, vaikeillekin
harhataipaleille ennenkuin taas selkeytyy itsestään, huomaa
harhamutkansa ja taaskin taistelee itsensä takaisin omalle uralleen.
Kuten ihmisen on kansankin ratkaisevissa ajankohdissa hetken kuohun
keskeltä palauduttava, keräydyttävä itseensä, on väkevällä
hillinnällä seisahdettava satunnaiset virtailut mielialoissaan,
sukellettava syvemmälle niihin ja seestyttävä sisäisesti tyveneksi
ja kirkkaaksi tavatakseen sisäisen olemuksensa hiljaisen, syvän ja
väkevän pohjavirran, jonka haltuun antautuen ainoastaan menneisyys
voi suorana ja hämmentymättömänä virrata tulevaisuudeksi.

       *       *       *       *       *

Suomen kansakin on parin, ehkä useammankin viimeisen vuosikymmenen
kuohukaudessa osaksi eksynyt itseltään ja on yhä kulkemassa
etäämmälle itsestään, särkymässä vuosisatojen luomasta
sivistyskansallisesta kokonaisuudestaan. Ja tätä uraa se on
kulkemassa osaksi väärinkäsitettyjen ja väärinsulatettujen,
hetkellisten poliittisten iskusanojen lumossa. On viime vuosina
unohdettu, että Suomen kansa ja Suomen historia eivät ole viimeisen
tai viimeisien vuosikymmenien, eivät edes viimeisen vuosisadankaan
luomia, ettei niiden syntyä ole laskettava ensimmäisen eduskunnan
kokoontumisesta, ei 1863-vuoden valtiopäivistä, ei edes Porvoon
valtiopäivistä, vaan että Suomen kansa on vuosisatojen
itsetiedottoman, sulattavan, kehittävän työn luoma elimellinen
kokonaisuus, jonka heräävät itsetietoisuuden ilmiöt ja
heräämisen vaiheet saatetaan määritellä edellämainituilla
merkkitapauksilla, mutta jonka olemus on saanut yksilöllisen
laatunsa, yksilölliset piirteensä, kansallisen muotonsa
kohtalokkaina vuosisatoina ennen tätä aikaa ja jonka ainekset ovat
perityt vielä kaukaisemmalta menneisyydeltä. Suomen kansa
historiallisena kansana, sivistyksellisenä kansayksilönä ei ole
viimeisen vuosisadan, vaan viimeisen vuosituhannen kehittämä ja
muodostama, sen periainekset ovat sitäkin vanhemmat, mutta vasta
viimeisen vuosituhannen vaiheissa nämä ainekset ovat sulautuneet,
muodostuneet ja hioutuneet siksi historialliseksi kokonaisuudeksi,
mikä meillä on edessämme Suomen kansana.

Sen minkä vuosisadat ovat luoneet, ovat viime vuosikymmenet--etenkin
viimeinen--pyrkineet särkemään ja särkemään sisäisessä
harhassa, hetkellisten mielipidekiihkojen sokaisussa. On alettu puhua
Suomen kansasta kahtena kansallisuutena aluksi heikosti,
epämääräisesti ikäänkuin epäröiden, vähitellen yhä
varmemmin, vakuutetummin, lopulta kiistämättömänä tosiasiana.
Onhan Suomessa kaksi kansanainesta: suomen- ja ruotsinkielinen asutus.
Mutta siitä ei tässä kansamme vähittäisessä lohkouttamisessa ole
ollut kysymys. Kysymys on historiallisten olosuhteidemme vuoksi
ruotsia puhuvan yläluokkamme ja suomea puhuvan kansapohjan
vierautumisesta toisestaan. Tämä ikäänkuin maamme ja kansamme
menneisyyden, tähänastisen historiallisen kehityksen itsekielto,
itsemurha on viimeaikaisen traagillisen historiamme traagillisin
vaihe.

Kukaan suomalainen, jolle kansamme sivistyksellinen, sanokaamme
europalainen menneisyys, kansamme viimeisen vuosituhannen historia ja
tämän historian kehitysviivojen eheys ovat kalliita, ei saata
tunnustaa kansallisesti ja sivistyksellisesti terveeksi ja
siunaukselliseksi tätä eristäytymispyrkimystä, joka tietoisena tai
tiedottomana virtauksena yhä väkevämpänä ja hallitsevampana
tulvii poliittisessa yhteiselämässämme ja yhteiskunnallisessa
yleistajunnassamme, ja joka voimastaan saa kiittää vain tilapäisen
kielieron aiheuttamaa optillista näköharhaa.

Tämä eristäytymispyrkimys, joka yhtä väkevästi on lumonnut
pauloihinsa kansamme kummankinkieliset kansalaisryhmät, ei nimittäin
ole historiallisesti eikä kansallisesti mitenkään oikeutettu ja
perusteltu. Suomen ruotsiapuhuva sivistyneistö ja suomalainen
kansapohja eivät vereltään eivätkä historialliselta
kehitykseltään ole eri kansaa. Niin kiinteästi kuin missään
muussa maassakin tahansa kuuluvat meilläkin kansa ja sivistyneistö
yhteen. Minkä ulkonaisen, vahingollisen kielierojuovan
historiallisten olosuhteiden sattuma onkin luonut kansamme sivistyneen
luokan ja kansan välille, sivistyneistömme on kuitenkin
elimellisesti Suomen kansaan kuuluva osa: on suurin piirtein
katsottuna verta sen verestä ja mikäli vierastakin alkuperää,
historiallisen kehityksen kautta sen elimeksi omistettu ja sulanut.


       *       *       *       *       *




KANSA--YKSILÖ--SIVISTYNEISTÖ.


Missään kansassa ei ole veren täydellistä yhteyttä. Kaikkien
nykyisten sivistyskansojen etnillinen kokoonpano ja alkuperä on
varsin kirjava ja epäyhtenäinen. Historiantakaiset, tietojemme
ylettyviltä ulottuvat ajat ovat olleet nähtävästi yhtämittaista
kansamyllerrystä: heimojen alinomaista vaellusta ja siirtyilemistä,
lakkaamatonta veren ja asuinsijojen vaihdosta, eroamista ja
yhtymistä. Tällaisista, rodullisesti varsin sekoittuneista heimoista
ovat nykyaikaiset europalaiset kansallisuudet muodostuneet sulattaen
jatkuvan pitkäaikaisen valtiollisen, yhteiskunnallisen ja
sivistyksellisen yhteiselämän puitteissa nämä ylen monitahkoiset
ainekset nykyisiksi yhtenäisiksi kansallisuusvaltioiksi.--Lienee
vaikeata ratkaista, onko esim. nykyinen Ranskan kansa etnillisesti
katsottava pääasiallisemmin keltiläis-gallialaiseksi vaiko
frankilais-burgundilais-normannilais-germaaniseksi, onko nykyinen
Saksa väkevämmästi germaaninen vaiko slaavilainen vai onko sen
kansallinen pohjaväri saanut voimakkaimman sävynsä ehkä muista
vielä alkuperäisemmistä, nykyiselle tieteelle tuntemattomista
kansa-aineksista tai mikä rotuaines antaa päävärin
englantilaiselle, italialaiselle, espanjalaiselle kansanluonteelle,
joissa kaikissa kansallisuuksissa germaaniset ja keltiläiset ainekset
eri tavoin ja eri määrin ovat sekoittuneet vielä aikaisempiin ja
pohjemmalta vaikuttaviin kansallisiin kanta-aineksiin.

Ja juuri kansan ilmekkäin, toimekkain osa, sen taloudellinen ja
sivistyksellinen ylin kerros on kaikkialla kautta koko historiallisen
ajanjaksonkin ollut yhä jatkuvan muukalaisvirran vaikutuksen
alaisena. Juuri nämä yhteiskunnallisen ja kansallisen sivistyksen
elokkaimmat ja luonnehtivimmat kerrokset sisältävät kaikkialla
runsaasti verrattain hyvinkin myöhäisperäistä kansainvälistä
ainesta. Paitsi sitä lakkaamatta tapahtuvaa ja vuosisatojen kuluessa
hyvinkin merkittävää verenkiertoa, joka sivistyskansojen kesken
juuri näissä yhteiskuntakerroksissa tapahtuu yksityisten
henkilösiirtymisten kautta, mitkä henkilösiirtymiset sangen useassa
tapauksessa merkitsevät uuden sivistyssuvun astumista asianomaisen
kansan henkiselle viljelysmaalle--paitsi tätä säännöllistä
verenuusiutumista, on huomautettava sellaisista joukkotapahtumista
kuin normannilaisten hyökkäys Englantiin, uskonpuhdistuksen
yhteydessä tapahtuneet joukkosiirtymiset, hugenottien karkoitukset
Ranskassa, uskonvainot Espaniassa, palkkasoturilaitoksen aiheuttamat
lukuisat asettumiset uusiin kansallisiin ympäristöihin, juutalaisten
vaellukset, jotka kaikki ovat tuoneet runsaasti uutta vierasta verta
uusiin ympäristöihinsä. Tällaiset uudet, uuteen kansalliseen ja
sivistykselliseen ympäristöön joutuneet suvut sulautuvat
tavallisesti jo toisessa tai ainakin kolmannessa polvessa
jäljettömiin uusiin ympäristöihinsä, haihtuvat siihen kuin sateen
pisara virran vuoluun--ja minkä sitte myöhemmin kuvastelevatkin
kultuuri-ilmiöitä, minkä luovatkin kultuuria, sen kuvastelevat ja
luovat sitä kansallista kultuuria, joka on heidän aineellisen ja
henkisen elämänsä lähtökohtana, aineksena ja toimikehänä.

Jokainen kansa on historiallisen yhteiselämän luoma kokonaisuus,
jonka jokaisessa solussa sykähtelee yhteinen elinhenki. Mikä ero
onkin maan uumeniin uppoavalla juurella, ylväästi, teräksisesti
ilmoihin nousevalla rungolla, huojuvalla, humisevalla lehvistöllä:
saman elimistön ilmestyksiä ne kuitenkin ovat ja sykkivät
yhteisenä samana elämisenpontena. Samaten kansakin. Miten eri
tahoille sen voimat näennäisesti ovatkin suuntautuneet, miten
vieraista, toisistaan etäällä olevista lähteistä sen jäsenet
näyttävätkin imevän elinnesteensä, miten eri näkö-alat niille
avautuvatkin, maan uumenet tai taivasten sinet, yhteisessä työssä
ne kuitenkin työskentelevät, ovat kansansa elämänhengen soluja,
sykkivät, välittävät, virtaavat sen elämää, ovat jokainen
kohdaltaan kaikessaan kansaansa, humiskoot sitte soivana lehvistönä
ilmojen sinessä ja juokoot auringon valoa kansansa elimistöön tai
hiipikööt hentoisina imusuonina mullan pimennossa noutaen
näkymättömässä työssä maan elähyttävät mehut kansansa
suoniin.

Kansa on rodullisen kokoonpanonsa, maantieteellisten- ja
ilmasto-olosuhteittensa, historiallisten vaiheittensa ja
yhteiskunnallisten olojensa yhteis-, vuoro- ja vastavaikutuksien
kehittämä elimistö, joka edelleen on yhtäläisen kehittymis-,
muodostumis- ja vaihtumisprosessin alaisena kuin aikaisemmissakin
vaiheissaan ja kuin mikään muukin elävä elimistö hyvänsä ja
joka alinomaa etsii, saa ja sulattaa uusia aineksia itseensä
elääkseen ja vaurastuakseen. Mikään elävä, kasvava kansa ei ole
sulkeutunut laatuunsa, pysähtynyt itseensä, vaan jokaisella
toimivalla huokosellaan imee se uusia vaikutuksia, uusia aineksia
itseensä: alinomaa virtaa siihen sen omasta rodullisesta juuresta,
sen omalta maantieteelliseltä pohjalta, sitä ympäröivästä, sen
kanssa kosketuksissa olevista lähikansoista, aikakauden
yhteiskunnallisista ja historiallisista virtauksista, hetken
henkisestä ilmakehästä henkisiä ja aineellisia vaikutuksia, jotka
saattavat kansan hengen alinomaiseen hiljaiseen muuttumistilaan.
Mikään kansa ei ole henkisesti eikä aineksellisestikaan itsenäinen
ja alkuperäinen: tuhannet suonet liittävät sen kulloiseenkin
hetkelliseen historialliseen tilanteeseen, ja tuhansilla suonilla on
se kautta historiallisen ja historiantakaisenkin olemassaolonsa juonut
verenvaikutuksia ja sivistysvaikutuksia itseensä siitä
ympäristöstä, johon sen ravintoa hakevat imusuonet vain ovat
jaksaneet ulottua.

Mutta joskaan ei itsenäinen, niin itseänsä kansa silti on,
itseänsä täydellisesti, tulisesti jokainen hetki. Kreikan tuore
raakalaiskansa herää hedelmälliseksi sivistyskansaksi vasta
juotuaan itämaiden sivistyksen itseensä. Tämän kansan henkiset
herätteet, kaikki ne ainekset, joista sen sivistys on rakentunut,
ovat juonnettavissa itämaille, mutta kreikkalainen, tulvivasti,
täyteläästi, jokaista kudosta myöten kreikkalainen on kuitenkin se
sivistys, joka kreikkalaisella pohjalla näistä vieraista aineksista
syntyy.--Englannin hallitsijakansa juontaa kansalliset juurensa yhtä
tukevasti alkuperäiseen brittiläis-keltiläiseen ja roomalaiseen
kuin myöhempään anglilais-saksilaiseen tai skandinaaviseen ja
normannilais-ranskalaiseen alkuperään, ja sen sivistyksen juuret
ovat yhtä syvällä keltiläisessä kuin germaanisessa, romaanisessa
kuin skandinaavisessa maaperässä; henkisen laatunsa ainekset on se
vuosisatain vaihteessa värjännyt vaikutuksilla yhtähyvin
kreikkalaisesta ja roomalaisesta muinaisuudesta kuin kunkin hetken
italialaisesta, espanjalaisesta, ranskalaisesta,
saksalais-hollantilaisesta nykyisyydestäkin, on yhtäläisesti
sulattanut oman henkensä aineksiksi Europan kuin valtamerien
takaistenkin sivistysmaailmain henkiset ilmakehät, nykyiset ja
entiset; mutta huolimatta kaikesta tästä--tai oikeammin juuri
tämän suunnattoman sulattamansa aineksen voimistamana--on Englannin
kansa, Englannin ylpeä hallitsijakansa jokaisena historiallisena
hetkenään, jokaisessa historiallisessa teossaan esiytynyt niin
ilmekkäänä, tulisesti ja tarmokkaasti yhteenkuuluvana
kansayksilönä, että Europan nykyisistä kansoista se
sivistyksellisesti esiytyy kansallisesti eheimpänä ja
yksilöllisimpänä.

Kansa, mikä sen etnillinen kokoonpano lieneekin, mistä se on
saanutkin sivistysvaikutuksensa ja mitä aineellisia ja henkisiä
herätteitä se onkin omakseen sulattanut, on nykyisellä elävällä
hetkellä ja on jokaisena entisenä hetkenään ollut kansallinen
kokonaisuus omine menneisyyksineen, jolle sen nykyisyys on perustunut
ja jolle sen tulevaisuuskin on rakentuva. Kansat ovat kokonaisuuksia,
yksilöitä, joilla on oma kiinteä, mutta kehityksenalainen laatunsa.

       *       *       *       *       *

Tällaisessa elimellisessä, sulattavassa ja omistavassa
kansakokonaisuudessa on erillinen yksilö erikoisine rodullisine tai
kansallisine sukupuineen haihtuva pisara. Rodullinen alkuperä,
sikäli kuin se on vaikuttamassa, ei merkitse yksilölle mitään
hänen kultuurinsa ulkokohtaiseen laatuun tai ainekselliseen
sisältöön nähden, ainoastaan tämän kultuurin henkilökohtaiseen
tarmoon. Se ei merkitse mihinkään erikoiseen määrättyyn
sivistyskokonaisuuteen kuulumista, vaan ainoastaan aivan puhtaasti
yksilöllistä ominaisuutta, taipumusta, jolle ympäristö antaa
aineksen ja sisällön. Yksilö saa uskomattomassa määrässä
henkisen elämänsä suunnan, värin ja sisällön siitä
ympäristöstä, jossa hän elää. Yksilö on täydellisesti kansa-,
yhteiskunta- ja sivistysympäristönsä kuvastus, ase, se väline,
jossa tämän ympäristön sisällys puhkee muodoksi. Yksilön
omaa--polveutukoon se kansan omasta tai vieraasta rodusta--on vain se
hengen intensiteetti, lahjakkuuden mitta, jolla hän yksilölliseltä
kohdaltaan omistaa itseensä ja toteuttaa tämän ympäristönsä
aineellisen ja henkisen sisällön. Yksilön henki liikkuu, kehäilee
ja toteutuu niissä aineksissa, jotka hänen ympäristönsä hänelle
antaa; niistä saa hänen mielikuvituksensa aineensa ja värinsä,
hänen tahtonsa teräksen ja karaisun, hänen lahjakkuutensa
tehtävät ja työkentän.

Rikkainkin, heränneinkin yksilö seisoo aina kansansa pohjalla;
hänen katseensa saattaa kantaa kauas, huimaaviinkin henkisiin
etäisyyksiin ja korkeuksiin, mutta pohja, jolta hän tähystää,
taso, joka määrää hänen näköpiirinsä rajat, on aina se
sivistyksellinen, kansallinen ympäristö, jossa hän elää.--Plato
sameammassa, epävalmiimmassa, henkisesti heräämättömässä
ympäristössä, joka ei olisi antanut hänen työskentelevän
henkensä läpitunkevalle voimalle rikasta aineistoa, laajaa
näköpiiriä, kirkasta, sisäistä viljeltyneisyyttä, olisi kaikilla
yksilöllisillä hengenvoimillaan varustettunakin takertunut vain
joksikin sokkeloiseksi Jakob Böhmeksi, jonka ajatukset
hedelmättömästi olisivat uurrelleet olemisen ongelmallisissa
läpinäkymättömissä syvyyksissä voimatta kirvoittua
vapahtuneeseen ja vapahtavaan, aurinkokatseiseen elämänavaruuden
näkemiseen.

Missä määrin yksilö yksilöllisine lahjakkaisuuksineen ja
taipumuksineen on sivuseikka kansallisessa kokonaisuudessa,
historiallinen, yhteiskunnallinen ja kansallisrodullinen
ympäristökokonaisuus ratkaiseva pääasia, sen osoittaa elävästi
henkisten voima- ja kukoistuskausien esiintyminen jossakin kansassa.
Todennäköisesti on tässä kansassa suurin piirtein katsottuna aina
piillyt sama määrä yksilöllistä lahjakkuutta, yksilöllisiä
henkisiä mahdollisuuksia, luovia voimayksilöitä, mutta nukkuvina
vuosisatoina on tämä yksilöllinen lahjakkuus uinunut kuin itseään
tajuamatta kansan sielun verhossa. Lahjakkaat, lahjakkaimmatkin
yksilöt ovat vaeltaneet yksilöllisen elämänsä tulematta tajuntaan
niistä hengenvoimista, jotka ovat olleet heidän olentoonsa
kätkettyinä; he ovat yksilöinä haihtuneet ja lahonneet kuin
siemen, joka ei ole joutunut mullan kätköön. Mutta ainoastaan
yksilöinä he siten tehottomina häviävät, mahdollisuuksina
pysyvät he yhä läsnä kansansa henkisessä voimakokonaisuudessa.
Kun vihdoinkin sattuu historiallinen tilanne, jolloin kansalla on
käyttötilaisuus näillekin tähän asti ponnettomina häilyneille
voimille, sukeltavat ne odottamatta esille jonkun Napoleonin, jonkun
Shakespearen huikaisevana haahmona näennäisesti kuin yksilöllisen
lahjakkuuden ja itsetehon lihaksitulona, todellisuudessa kuitenkin
aina vain kulloisenkin kansallisen voima-aallon ylimpänä,
heijastavimpana huippuna. Ellei tilanne, heidän yksilöllisten
lahjojensa suunnassa kulkeva kansallinen voima-aalto olisi heitä
vyöryttänyt esiin, olisi Napoleon kuollut eläkkeellä olevana
ranskalaisena everstiluutnanttina Ajacciossa ja Shakespeare
kunnioitettuna porvarina Stratford-on-Avonissa, ja heidän muistonsa,
jossa heidän loistokkaat kansansa nyt näkevät kansallisen henkensä
loistavimman ilmestyksen, lepäisi ikuisen unhotuksen povessa niin
monen muun ehkä heidän vertaisensa, varjoon jääneen henkisen
suurmiehen muiston rinnalla.

Yksilöllinen hengentarmo on vain kansan ase, se uinuu kätkettynä
mahdollisuutena kansan henkisessä elimistössä, muodostaa toisten
kaltaistensa kanssa ikäänkuin kansan henkisen voimasäiliön,
tarmopatouman, ja otollisena hetkenä vasta, milloin tilanne juuri sen
lahjoja kaipaa--olkoon tämä hetki nyt, olkoon vasta vuosisadan
takana--kirpoaa, sinkoaa se henkensä tehossa esiin ja muuttuu tekonsa
loistossa näkyväksi kuten pimeyden vaipassa piillyt saari, johon
valonsäteet yhtäkkiä sattuvat.

Eikä kansa tätä asetta tarvitessaan, katso tämän aseen
alkuperää. Napoleonin, korsikalaisen se suistaa ranskalaisen
kunnian, sota- ja seikkailuhengen, loisteliaan, näkyvän toimitarmon
säihkyvimmäksi edustajaksi. Bellmanin, saksalaisperäisen se
soinnuttaa eräiden ruotsalaisessa kansanluonteessa piileväin
tunnelmallisten, surumielisesti iloittelevien ja vallattomien
mielialojen herkimmäksi laulavimmaksi ilmestykseksi. Larin-Kyöstin,
täysverisen ruotsalaisen, se sävyttää ja mielikuvituksellisesti
ravitsee aidoimman hämäläisen luonnon ja kansanluonteen, vaistoisan
korpimystiikan ja verevän kansanhuumorin herkäksi tulkiksi ja
kuvastajaksi.

Yksilöllisessä nerossa on kuitenkin aina säkene itsevoimaista
aurinkoa. Se on valonlähde, joka kyllä on sidottu ympäristöönsä,
riippuu tästä ympäristöstään, mutta joka myöskin valaisee
tätä ympäristöään. Se kirpoaa ja vaikuttaa kansallisen
sivistyksen pohjalta, on tämän pohjan liikkeiden läike, on kansan
elinponnen kärki. Mutta yksilön omaa, hänen omasta verestään,
hänen perityn henkisen ja aineellisen laatunsa kudoksista noudettua
on kuitenkin se kiihkeys ja tarmo, jolla hän suorittaa ympäristön
ja olosuhteitten hänelle antaman teon. Kansa antaa hänelle
tehtävän, määrää hänen elintehtävänsä sisällön, mutta
yksilönä, hänen vereensä ja tuntemisen mahtiinsa kätketyillä
voimilla hän tekonsa suorittaa.

       *       *       *       *       *

Sivistyneistö yhtenäisenä kokonaisuutena katsottuna on sensijaan
kaikessa sitä kansaympäristöä, jonka pintakerrosta se on. Se on
kansan luuta ja lihaa, on kansan tietoisa osa, se elin, jossa kansan
henkinen kypsyys kirpoaa toimivaksi.

Kulloinenkin sivistystaso, aineellisen ja henkisen kultuurin summa on
ikäänkuin yhteenveto kansan historiallisen työn, vuosisatoja
kestäneen, sukupolvi sukupolvelta perityn luomisen tuloksista. Siinä
on kerrostuma kerrostumalta läsnä kaikki se pysyvä aineellinen ja
henkinen saavutus, minkä kansa on elämästä voinut irroittaa
pysyvään, jäävään muotoon. Tämän sivistyspääoman näkyvänä
kannattajana, hoitajana on kansallisen kehityksen ylin kerros, se
pintakerros, jonka historian virtaukset, tapahtumien sattuma, useasti
oma kuntokin ovat vyöryttäneet kansallisen kehityksen huipulle ja
huipuksi; mutta se on vain tämän sivistysperinnön kannattaja,
hoitaja, edustaja, ei sen luoja, omistaja. Kuten veden pintakalvo ei
itsessään ole sen vesimäärän kokonaisuus, jonka näkyvänä
rajaviivana se päilyilee--on vain tämän vesimäärän
ulottuvaisuuden ulkonainen raja, joka on alinomaisessa
hengittävässä, nousevassa tai laskevassa liikunnossa, sikäli kuin
sen kätkössä oleva, sitä kannattava vesimäärä paisuu tai
laskee--samaten ei kansan ylin kerroskaan, se, jossa kansan
sivistyspatouma ilmestyy toimivana, näkyvänä, ole itsessään muuta
kuin kansan sivistystason näkyvä rajaviiva, pinta, joka hengittää,
nousee ja laskee kansan hetkellisen voimarikkauden noustessa tai
laskiessa.

Kansan ylin kerros, se kerros, jossa kerätty henkinen rikkaus herää
toimivaksi, jossa unhotukseen vaipuneiden sukupolvien ja nykyisen
näkymättömissä työskentelevän kansapohjan yhteinen henkinen ja
aineellinen voimasäästö kuin polttopisteessään sykähtelee ja
kukoistaa puhjeten voiman kukkurassaan itsenäisiksi hengen
teoiksikin, kuuluu yhtä kiinteästi ja välittömästi kansaan kuin
mikä salaisin, pohjaisin solu hyvänsä kansaelimistössä; on
voimassaan kansansa voimaa, teoissaan kansansa tekoja, loistossaan
kansansa loistoa, kukoistuksessaan kansansa kukoistusta. Älköön
ylpeilkö kukan terä heloittavuudestaan, ikäänkuin olisi sen
värien herkeä loisto sen omaa luomaa: tuhansin tiehykkein on se
liitetty lehvien ja rungon salaiseen elämään, juurien uupumattomaan
työhön maan ikuisessa hedelmällisessä viileydessä, niitä
tiehykkeitä myöten ovat ilmojen siniriemu ja maan sykkivä
väkevyyden punerrus imeytyneet sen kupuun: vamma juureen tai haava
runkoon ja kukkasen poskelle leviää kuoleman valjuus ja hedelmä
surkastuu ennenkuin se on muodostunutkaan.

Kansan toimiva kerros, aineellinen ja henkinen ylimystö, luova ja
nauttiva, aineellisen vaurauden ja henkisen tietoisuuden
päivänvaloon noussut ja siinä elävä pintakerros on kansan kaiken
aineellisen saavutuksen ja henkisen sivistysperinnön sekä ilmestys
että vaalija. Siinä on läsnä se henkinen tarmo, jonka väistyneet
sukupolvet ovat jaksaneet herättää, viljellä toimivaksi
itsetiedottomasta kansasielusta; siinä on läsnä se elämäntapojen,
elämäntunnon, elämänkaipuun hioutuminen, herkistyminen ja
hienostuminen, joka polvi polvelta on virittynyt kansassa ja viljelty
eläväksi yhteisomaisuudeksi jäyhän, karun elämän kamarasta;
sillä on käytettävinään kaikki se aineellinen vauraus, joka
kansan kaikkien menneitten ja nykyisten sukupolvien uuraan yhteistyön
ylijäämänä on muodostunut vapaaksi, irralliseksi
kansallisvarallisuudeksi. Kaikestaan on tämä kerros velassa
kansalle, kansan kaikelle menneisyydelle ja sen koko nykyisyydelle: on
velassa aineellisesta vauraudestaan, on velassa henkisestä
luomistarmostaan ja -vapaudestaan, on velassa elämäntuntojensa ja
-vaatimustensa hienoudesta ja herkistymisestä, siitä henkisen
näköpiirin avaruudestakin ja vapaudesta, joka sillä kansansa
henkisen perinnön huipulla seisten on koko ihmiskunnan henkiseen
viljelykseen.

SUOMEN SIVISTYNEISTÖ JA KANSALLINEN KOKONAISUUS.


Niin kiinteästi ja välittömästi kuin missään muuallakin, on
Suomessakin sivistyneistö kansan henkisen tason näkyvä muoto.
Suomenkin sivistyneistö on kunakin historiamme hetkenä edustanut
sitä saavutusta, johon Suomen henkinen viljelys kulloinkin on
kypsynyt ja kohonnut. Suomen suomalaisesta kansapohjasta on se
määräävältä, värittävältä, sävyttävältä
enemmistöltään noussut; mikäli siinä on vierastakin verta, on
tämä veri kunakin ajankohtana sulautunut kansallisen sivistyneistön
vallitsevaan suomalaiseen kanta-aineistoon vain rikastuttaen,
monipuolistuttaen, henkisesti ja verellisesti elävöittäen sitä,
mutta sen kansallista laatua ratkaisevasti muuttamatta. Suomenkin
aineellinen ja henkinen ylin kerros on vain Suomen kansan
päiväpuolikerrosta, se kansallinen kerrostuma, johon viljelyksen
elähyttävät säteet ovat sattuneet ja joka sen alla ja kätkössä
elävien ja tykkivien voimien ja mehujen väkevöittämänä on
saavuttamassaan auringonvalossa puhjennut kukkaan ja hedelmänkantoon.

Suomenkin sivistyneistö on kansansa historiallisen kehityksen,
suomalaisen kansallisen viljelyksen sekä tulos että ase; se on sekä
kansansa saavutetun aineellisen ja henkisen viljelyksen näkyvä
ilmestys että myöskin se elin, jonka avulla kansa taistelee itsensä
yhä elävämpään itsetietoon, yhä syvempään, herkempään
viljelykseen.

Tässä, että sivistyneistö välittömästi on sekä kansansa
sivistystyön saavutus että kansansa tulevaisen sivistystyön ase, ei
merkitse mitään se, jos erikoisten historiallisten olosuhteitten
vuoksi tämä sivistyneistö on joutunut kielellisesti irroittautumaan
varsinaisesta kansasta, omasta kansastaan. Silti on tämä
sivistyneistö kaikessaan kansansa vuosisataisen viljelystyön
saavutus ja kannattaja, ja silti lepää tällä sivistyneistöllä
olemisen velkana velvollisuus olla tämän oman kansansa
sivistyselimenä.--Jos Suomessa erikoiset historialliset olosuhteet
ovat vuosisatojen kuluessa kehittäneet yläluokkamme
ruotsinkieliseksi, ei tämä vielä merkitse sitä, että
yläluokkamme silti olisi vaihtunut kansallisuudeltaan toiseksi kuin
mitä se itsessään on: yhä se silti pysyy vereltään pääasiassa
suomalaisena ja--mikä ratkaisee--yhä se silti on Suomen kansan
historiallisen kehityksen tulos. Ruotsinkielisenäkään se ei syki
Ruotsin kansan verta, eikä se viljelys, jonka povelta se on
puhjennut, josta se on imenyt ja edelleen imee mehunsa ja aineksensa,
josta se on saanut sekä olemisensa sisällön että muodon, ole
Ruotsin kansan vuosisataisen työn ponnistuksesta ilmoille puserrettu.
Suomalainen on yläluokkamme vereltään ja--mikäli se edustaa ja
sisältää aineellista ja henkistä viljelystä--on se viljelys
suomalaisen vaivannäön, suomalaisen ponnistuksen elämän kovasta
kamarasta esille taistelemaa. Yläluokallamme on olemisen ja
esiytymisen ehtona ja edellytyksenä kaikki se uuras,
näkymättömissä tapahtunut viljelystyö, jonka Suomen kansan
menneet ja nykyiset sukupolvet ovat vuosisatojen vaiheissa
suorittaneet ja nykyhetkellä suorittavat: se on suomalaisen työn
näkyvä tulos, suomalaisessa veressä, suomalaisessa maaperässä,
suomalaisessa historiassa ovat sen kaikki juuret.

Mikäli alkuperä velvoittaa, mikäli kukaston elinvelvollisuutena,
olemisentehtävänä on kantaa sen elimistön hedelmää, jonka
povella se on puhjennut, jonka juurien, solujen tietä se imee
elämänsä mehun ja jossa yksin sillä on olemisensa, elämänsä ja
kukoistuksensa, sikäli on Suomenkin sivistyneistöllä
olemisenvelvollisuutena--tai paremmin vielä olemisen oikeutena ja
olemisen toteuttamisena--velvollisuus olla kansansa sivistyksen, ei
ainoastaan ilmestys ja tulos, vaan myöskin tekijä.

Suomalaisen kansallisen sivistyksen suurin vamma onkin siinä, että
kielen juopa on joutunut eroittamaan toisistaan varsinaisen kansan ja
sen sivistyneistön, jonka vuosisatainen viljelystyö on tästä
kansasta kamppaillut ja kehittänyt esille. Tämä kielen juopa on
puolella ja toisella aiheuttanut sen harhatunnon kuin olisi tämän
kielieron takana olemassa todellinen kansallinenkin ero, kuin
edustaisi ruotsinkielinen sivistyneistömme vierashenkistä
sivistystä, jonka siteistä suomalaisen kansasielun on vapauduttava
löytääkseen oman todellisen itsensä, ja kuin olisi suomalainen
kansapohja toista vierasta rotua, jonka vereen ja vaistoihin ei voi
istua se viljelys, jonka edustajaksi ruotsinkielinen yläluokkamme
itsensä katsoo. Tämä harhatunto on aikojen kuluessa ja olojen
vaikutuksesta päässyt syöpymään yhä syvemmälle yleiseen
tietoisuuteen, ja uhkaa se kestävänä mielialavirtauksena
lopullisesti todella lohkoa kansamme sivistyksellisesti eri ryhmiksi.
Varsinkin viime aikoina ovat nämä eri tolille joutumisen oireet
aivan ahdistavassa määrässä kasvaneet ja muuttuneet
itsetietoisiksi ja päämäärästään selviksi.

       *       *       *       *       *

Tätä vierauden tuntoa on tehostamassa ja kiihdyttämässä se
ilmeinen erilaisuus, joka todella kyllä on vallitsemassa vanhan
ruotsinkielisen sivistyneistömme ja muodostumassa olevan nuoren
suomenkielisen sivistyneistön yksilöllisten laatupiirteiden
välillä.

Toisaalla vanha perinnäiskultuuri: sen joustavampi muotovalmius,
hiotumpi älyllisyys ja herkempi yksilöllinen viljely, joka varustaa
jokaisen jäsenensä sekä valmiimmalla hengen notkeudella että
keskitetyllä, tiiviillä, iskevällä asiallisuudella; toisaalla
nuori, vielä alullaan ja muodostumassa oleva kultuuri: sen
muodollinen epävalmius, hapuileva ylimalkaisuus, löyhä, vähän
pintapuolinen, ja epäasiallinen aatteellisuus, jonka kehässä
yksilö ei vielä voi valmiina perintönä saada sitä hengen
viljelystä, terästystä ja tiivistystä, minkä vasta
perinnäissivistys, vanhalla kultuurilla ladattu ilmakehä voi
antaa--nämä molemmat ovat toisiinsa verrattuina käsitetyt, ei eri
kultuuritason, jota ne ovat, vaan eri kansallisuuspohjan, eri rodun
tuntomerkkeinä.

Täten aiheutunutta henkisen vierautumisen tuntoa on vielä lisäksi
ollut tehostamassa eräs toinenkin historiallisten olosuhteittemme
luoma laatupiirre ruotsinkielisessä sivistyneistössämme.
Ruotsinkielinen sivistyksemme ja ruotsinkielinen sivistyneistömme on
historiallisista syistä etupäässä muodostunut
länsisuomalais-hämäläisellä maaperällä ja pohjalla ja kantaa
edelleen vahvasti tämän alkuperäisen pohjansa laatuominaisuuksia.

On nimittäin olemassa varsin tuntuva laatuero itäsuomalaisen ja
länsisuomalaisen kansanluonteen välillä. Tämä laatuero johtunee
useastakin samaan suuntaan vaikuttavasta asianhaarasta.
Länsisuomalais-hämäläisen asutuksen raja, joka yleispiirteisesti
määritellen kulkee Kyminjoen laaksoa ja Päijännettä pitkin
taipuen Päijänteen pohjoispäästä Pohjanlahtea kohden, on samalla
myöskin maamme vanhemman ja vankemman maanviljelysalueen raja, ja
värjännee jo tämä vakiintuneemman maanviljelyskultuurin tanakka
vauraampi asettuneisuus kansanluonnetta tällä alueella.
Länsisuomalais-hämäläinen ja savolais-karjalainen kansanluonne
ovat voineet saada eroavat vivahduksensa osaksi juuri tästä
aineellisen kultuurin vanhemmuudesta tai nuoremmuudesta--toisaalta
vanhemmasta, juurtuneemmasta yhteiskunnallisesta viljeltymisestä,
yhteiselämän juuriin pureutuneemmasta elämäntottumusten
muokkautumisesta, toisaalta nuoremmasta, vielä hataraksi ja
sulautumattomaksi jääneestä, epävalmiimmasta sivistys- ja
muokkaustyöstä.

Mutta mahdollisuuksien ulkopuolella ei myöskään ole varsin
huomattavakin veren ja rodun erivivahteisuus näiden kansamme kahden
pääryhmän välillä. Edellytettynä kuten eräät kieli- ja
esihistorialliset seikat antanevat aihetta olettamaan, että
länsisuomalais-hämäläiset ovat saapuneet maahamme Virosta,
savolais-karjalaiset taas idästä ja kaakosta, niin ovat
länsisuomalaiset sekä aikaisemmilla että nykyisillä
asuinsijoillaan joutuneet monipuolisiin, elokkaisiin ja kestäviin
kosketuksiin germaanisten kansanheimojen kanssa, kun taas
savolais-karjalaiset ovat olleet yhtä eloisan ja kestävän
vaikutuksen alaisina slaavilaiselta taholta. Länsisuomalaisen
kansa-aineksemme sekä verellistä että sivistyksellistä
germaanistumista jo historiantakaisina aikoina tehostaa vielä se
seikka, että uudemman esihistoriallisen tutkimuksen mukaan nykyisen
länsisuomalaisten asuma-alueen pohja-asutus on ollut germaaninen,
joka nähtävästi rauhallista tietä vähitellen on sulautunut
tulokkaisiin. Kun vielä ottaa huomioon varsinaisen historiallisen
ajan tapahtumat, jolloin länsisuomalainen asutus jatkuvasti on
sulattanut itseensä runsaasti ruotsalaista rannikkoasutusta, samalla
kuin itäiset kansaheimomme alinomaisten sotien ja niiden seurauksien
vuoksi tuontuostakin ovat saaneet vahvoja venäläisiä veriannoksia
sulatettavikseen, niin lienee oikeutettu väittämään, että
länsisuomalaishämäläinen heimo on vahvasti germaanisesti
väritetty, kun taas itäsuomalaisessa laatusävyssä kuvastelee
melkoisesti slaavilaisia luonnepiirteitä.

Ero itä- ja länsisuomalaisen kansanluonteen laatusävyssä onkin
jotenkin sama kuin on ero slaavilaisten ja germaanisten
yleispiirteisten luonnesävyjen välillä: toisaalla verrattain avoin
herttainen elokkuus ja välittömyys, toisaalla jäyhempi, karumpi
sulkeutuneisuus. Itäsuomalaisissa henkisesti liukuvampaa,
antoisampaa, mutta höllempää valmiutta, syttyvää, mutta
ylimalkaista innostelua ja harrastelua, juoksevaa sanavalmiutta ja
-vuolautta, kun on kysymyksessä yleinen suuntailu ja ylimalkainen
periaatteilu, mutta laimea, mieto, herpoutuva tartunta silloin, kun on
kysymyksessä kouraisu asialliseen, henkiseen tai aineelliseen
todellisuuteen ja tämän arkisen todellisuuden kärsivällinen
muodostaminen tahtovan mielikuvituksen mukaan.
Länsisuomalais-hämäläisissä taas henkisesti niukempi ja karumpi,
näköään vaatimattomampi, mutta todellisempi, koottu, kohdistuva ja
tarmokas hengenlaatu, sisäänpäinkääntynyt, niin sanoakseni
asialliseen täsmällisyyteen sitoutuva mielikuvitus, juro, tiukka,
sanojen ja liikkeiden liioittelua välttävä, melkein askeettisesti
kuivakiskoinen ja koruton asiallisuus.--Kirjallisuudessammekin näkee
tämän laatueron kuvastelua, ja edustaa siinä laulavaa, liukuvaa,
väljää karjalaisuutta elävimmästi ja loistoisimman Kalevala, kun
taas miehisesti järeämmän, yksilöllisesti hehkutetumman
länsisuomalais-hämäläisen laatusävyn suurimpina muistomerkkeinä
kirjallisuudessamme ovat Raamatun käännös [ja Aleksis Kiven runous.]

Tämä luonnesävyjen ero on jokaiselle kansallista elämäämme
myötäelävälle kiistämätön. Onpa tämä vastakohtaisuus niin
tuntuva, että melkein yksilöä myöten voi päätellä, kummanko
heimon katsomustavat ja tunnesävy asianomaista henkilöä
vallitsevat, ja että koko julkisessa yhteiselämässämme voisi
vainuta ja seurata itä- ja länsisuomalaisten mielialasuuntien ja
-virtailujen vuorottelevaa voitollepääsyä.

Nyt on--kuten jo huomautin--vanha ruotsinkielinen sivistyksemme
ratkaisevassa määrässä muodostunut
länsisuomalais-hämäläisellä maaperällä ja pohjalla ja kantaa
edelleen vahvasti tämän alkuperänsä väriä, samalla kuin uusi
nouseva suomenkielinen sivistys melkein liika hallitsevasti on
perinyt määrääviä laatupiirteitä ja väriä
savolais-karjalaiselta henkipohjalta. Sitenpä joutuu näiden kansamme
kahden pohjalaadun eroavaisuus ja sen aiheuttama vieroksuva
suhtautuminen vielä tehostamaan jo erikielisyyden synnyttämää
juopaa kummankin sivistyneistömme välillä ja yhä vahvistamaan
sitä harhakäsitystä, että ruotsinkielisen sivistyneistömme muka
kansallisesti vieraana on vieroksuttava Suomen kansaakin.

Sivistystasojen kehitysero ja eri heimoilta peritty luonnesävyn ero
ovat yhtyneinä tilapäisten historiallisten olosuhteiden aiheuttamaan
kielieroon virittäneet ja juurruttaneet kummallakin puolella mieliin
sen, näissä olosuhteissa läheisen ja luonnollisen vaistoharhan,
että erikieliset sivistyksemme muka edustaisivat myöskin eri
kansallisia ja rodullisia hengenlaatuja, että ruotsinkielinen
sivistyksemme olisi laadultaankin meille aivan vieras muodostuma,
josta eroittautuminen on kansallisen suomalaisen sivistyksen elinehto,
ja että ruotsinkieliselle sivistyneistöllemme eristäytyminen
suomalaisesta yhteiselämästä merkitsisi tämän sivistyneistön
heräämistä ja selkeytymistä omaan kansallisrodulliseen
itsetajuntaan.

Mutta miten luonnollinen ja selitettävä tämä vaistoharha onkin,
niin vaarallinen ja tuhoisa se silti on kansallisen sivistyksemme
kokonaisuudelle: tuhoisa kansalliselle sivistyksellemme
kokonaisuudessaan, vielä tuhoisampi kummallekin niistä ryhmistä
erikseen, jotka nyt näiden kiistämättömien, mutta kuitenkin
ainoastaan näennäisten luulosyiden sokaisemina pyrkivät erilleen
toisistaan. Niin totta kuin kukka kuoleutuu, jos se irroitetaan
varrestaan, ja niin totta kuin juuren on vaikea uudestaan versota, jos
siltä sen varsi katkotaan, niin totta vuotaa kuiville jalointa Suomen
verta, jos se, minkä vuosisatainen yhteinen kasvaminen on luonut,
viilletään toisestaan irti. Suomen ruotsinkielinen sivistyneistö ei
surkastumatta voi tätä eroittumista, tätä kansallisesti
juurettomaksi joutumista kestää, ja kipeän, vaikean, vaikk'ei aivan
yhtä korvaamattoman vamman saa Suomen suomalainen kansapohjakin
kestää, jos siltä menee kansallisesti menetyksiin se korkeamman
henkisen viljelyksen ase, jonka sukupolvien ja vuosisatojen työ sille
oli valmiiksi hionut.

KANSALLINEN POLVEUTUMINEN.


Kielipoliittisessa taistelussamme nykyään esiytyvä pyrkimys
käsittää erikieliset kansalaisryhmämme vereltään eri rotuisiksi
perustuu siis eräänlaatuiseen näköharhaan. Historiallisten
olosuhteiden luoma kieliero, sivistyksen vanhemmuuden aiheuttama
kehitystasoero, verrannollisesti runsaampi verellinen ja
traditionellinen pohjautuminen länsisuomalais-hämäläiseen
kansapohjaan ja -laatuun yhtyneenä jonkinvertaiseen--vaikka luultua
paljoa vähäisempään--veren vierauteen vain ovat ne rajaviivat,
jotka eroittavat ruotsinkielisen sivistyneistömme nuoremmasta
suomenkielisestä sivistyneistöstä ja jotka väärintajuttuina ja
väärintulkittuina tunnevaikuttimina ovat tehostaneet näiden
erikielisten kansalaisryhmiemme vierautumista toisistaan siinä
määrin, että harhautunut ja harkitsematon yleistajunta on johtunut
antamaan näille tilapäisille ja pinnallisille laatueroille jopa
ratkaisevan rotueron sisällön ja merkityksen.

       *       *       *       *       *

Jos olisi mahdollista laatia seikkaperäinen sukutilasto
sivistyneistömme polveutumisesta, kävisi siitä epäilemättä
varsin selvästi ja vakuuttavasti ilmi tämän sivistyneistön
vallitseva suomalaisuus. Tietysti on tämä sivistyneistö sulattanut
itseensä tuntuvat määrät ruotsalaista ja muutakin kansainvälistä
ainesta, mutta kanta-ainekseltaan on se kuitenkin aina ollut ja
pysynyt suomalaisena.

Läheinen valtiollinen yhteytemme Ruotsin kanssa on aiheuttanut
kummankinpuolisen vilkkaan virkamies- ja sotilassukujen vaihdon.
Keskiaikainen vilkas hansakauppa ajoiksi puolittain saksalaistutti
kaupunkimme. Lukuisten sotain aiheuttama kestävä
palkkasoturijärjestelmä ja muut olosuhteet ovat kuten Ruotsiinkin
vetäneet tänne meillekin aikojen kuluessa runsaitakin
tulokasmääriä, joista useat valta- ja sivistyssukumme polveutuvat.
Varsinkin saksalaista ainesta on Saksasta ja Itämerenmaakunnista
saapunut tänne niin runsaasti, että meillä polveutuu jopa
useampikin valtasuku saksalaisesta kuin alkuperäisesti ruotsalaisesta
kantaisästä.

Mutta on huomattava ensinnäkin, että nämä tulokkaat ovat saapuneet
maahamme varsin pitkänä, useamman vuosisadan kestävänä
ajanjaksona, että ne eivät koskaan ole saapuneet niin tiheinä
ryhminä, että ne hetkellisestikään olisivat saavuttaneet
henkisesti vallitsevaa asemaa yhteiskunnassamme, vaan että ne ovat
saapuneet siten yksitellen, tilapäisesti ja vähitellen, että
kunakin ajankohtana uudet suvut aina täydellisesti ovat ennättäneet
sulautua jo olevan kansallisen ympäristön pohjalle,
naturaliseerautua historiallisesti ja kansallisesti suomalaiseen
sivistyskehään tuoden ainoastaan uusia aineksia, uutta
kehitysvirikettä siihen, verestäen sitä, mutta mitenkään
ratkaisevammasti sen sisäistä suuntaa ja laatua muuttamatta.
Suomalainen kansallisuus on jokaisena ajankohtana tasaisesti ja
vaikeudetta jaksanut siinä määrin sulattaa nämä uudet ainekset
historialliseen ja sivistykselliseen kokonaisuuteensa, että nämä
uudetkin sulatetut ainekset jo vuorostaan ovat myöhäisempiin
tulokkaisiin nähden välittömästi ja ehdottomasti kuuluneet siihen
sulattavaan kansalliseen pohja-aineistoon, jonka helmaan nämä
myöhäisemmät tulokkaatkin taas vuorostaan jäljettömästi
haihtuvat.

Vielä on otettava huomioon, että tänne saapuneista tulokkaista
todennäköisesti enimmät ovat vasta täällä, suomalaisessa
ympäristössä perustaneet perheen ja että sukujen myöhempipolviset
jälkeläiset--lukuunottamatta avioliittoja tällaisten tulokassukujen
omassa kehässä--runsaasti ovat joutuneet perustamaan avioliittoja
puhtaasti suomalaisenkin ympäristön pohjalle, joten vierasperäisten
sukujemmekin vierasverisyys täten jatkuvasti ja kestävästi on
joutunut ohenemaan ja kulumaan, ja että tällä vierasverisyydellä
lopulta on enää vain historiallista, mutta ei sanottavaa
kansallisrodullista merkitystä.

Sukujen alkuperää ratkaistaessa on myöskin otettava lukuun sekin
seikka, että sukujen alkuperän määritteleminen monessa tapauksessa
on suoritettava hyvin epäiltävien sukutarinain perustuksella. Varsin
usein saattaa puhtaasti kotimainenkin suku tällaisten sukutarinain
valossa esiintyä vieraana. On nimittäin aina ja kaikissa oloissa
ollut kiehtova eksoottisuutensa vieraalla alkuperällä, ja
mielellään vaippaa arkisinkin sielu viattomalla runollisella
itsekultauksella alkuperänsä siihen vaatimattomaankin romantiikan
heijastukseen, jonka jossakin suhteessa epätavallinen ja poikkeava
polveutuminen voi antaa. Kun norjalainen poroporvari, jolla ei ole
muutakaan häikäisevämpää sukupuuta esitettävänään, kuitenkin
tahtoo saada jotakin romantiikan heijettä, jotakin taikaisen
demoonisuuden vilettä vereensä ja sukuperäänsä, tarinoi hän
heikkona hetkenään mielihyväisesti jostakin esi-isästään, jonka
suonissa on juossut pisara suomalaista tai lappalaista verta. Ja yhtä
herkällä runollisella luomiskyvyllä unelmoi jokin kuopiontakainen
Asikainen savolaissuoniinsa puhdasta Asa-verta jostakin
epämääräisen muistotarinan haamuttelemasta kanta-isästä--tekee
tämän silläkin uhalla, että kerran johtelemiseen johduttua suku
tulee juonnetuksi hamaan kantaisään »asinukseen» asti.--Senpä
vuoksi lienevät ne suvut, joiden alkuperästä tiedot ovat
epämääräiset tai ristiriitaiset, useimmissa tapauksissa
oletettavat kotimaisiksi.

Jos alkaisi päätellä sivistyneistömme yleistä
kansallisperäisyyttä sukutieteellisen kirjallisuutemme antamien
tietojen perustuksella, johtaisi sekin menetelmä osaksi vääriin
päätelmiin. Tässä kirjallisuudessa joutuu nimittäin
sivistyneistömme vieras alkuperä esiytymään tuntuvasti
korostetumpana, kuin minä se esiintyisi, jos olisi käytettävissä
laajempi aineisto. Eri sukukirjoissamme käsitellään ainoastaan
aatelistoamme ja ilmekkäimpiä sivistyssukujamme, kun taas
sivistyneistön määräävän kokonaisuuden meillä kuten muuallakin
muodostaa sankka, keskipinnan tasoon ja nimettömyyteen verhoutuva
sukumetsä. Nyt ovat tulokkaat irrallisen, elokkaan alotetarmonsa,
seikkailevan ennakkoluulottomuutensa--sekä henkisen että aineellisen
varallisuutensa niin sanoakseni käteisyyden ja käytettävyyden
vuoksi--kaikkialla ja kaikissakin olosuhteissa etupäässä liittyneet
kulloisenkin uuden ympäristönsä toimivaan intelligensiin, sen
elokkaimpaan ja esiintyvimpään kerrokseen. Siten etenkin meillä,
jossa tulokkaat säännöllisesti ovat tulleet paljoa
kehittyneemmistä oloista vielä verrattain alkuperäiseen,
viljelemättömään ympäristöön ja siten jo sinään taitoineen ja
tietoineen joutuneet sivistystekijöiksi uudessa ympäristössään
saavuttaen täten aineellisen vaurauden ja yhteiskunnallisen aseman,
joka on helpoittanut heidän jälkeläisilleenkin tällä
saavutetulla, näkyvällä yhteiskuntatasolla
säilymisen.--Sivistyneistö kokonaisuudessaan--myöskin vähemmän
ilmekkäät ja etualalle päässeet, keskipinnan varjoon painautuneet
suvut lukuunotettuina--on kaiken todennäköisyyden perustuksella
ollut vielä tuntuvasti suomalaisempi kuin mitä näkyvimmistä
sivistyssuvuista tehdyt johtopäätökset oikeuttavat
päättelemään. Ja tämä hallitsevasti suomalainen
yläluokka-kokonaisuus on kuitenkin kautta kaiken historiallisen
kehityksemme ollut sinä ainesmerenä, jolla alkuperäisesti puhtaasti
vieraatkin suvut ovat pitkäaikaisessa, useampipolvisessa
oleskelussaan tässä maassa joutuneet verestämään itsensä ja
vähitellen monessa polvessa tapahtuneiden avioliittojen jälkeen
kansallisesti ja verellisestikin liittymään ja sulamaan uuteen
elämänympäristöönsä.

Nämä kaikki asianhaarat lukuunotettuina, voinee suurin piirtein
katsoen väittää, että sivistynyt yläluokkamme 1800-luvun
keskivaiheilla täydellisestä ruotsinkielisyydestään huolimatta
kansallisesti oli hallitsevassa määrässä suomalaista, ja että se
verellisesti kuten sivistyksellisestikin oli Suomen kansaa.

SIVISTYKSELLINEN ERISTÄYTYMINEN--ERIKOISTUMINEN--RAPPEUTUMINEN.


Terve henkinen ja aineellinen elämä tarvitsee kansallisen
kokonaisuuden taustan, eikä keinotekoista, sepitettyä kansallista
taustaa, väkivalloin sellaiseksi järkeiltyä, vaan luonnollisen
välittömän kansallisen maaperän, pohjan, johon se upottaa
juurensa, josta se imee mehunsa ja verensä, joka hetkellisen
elämänuudistumisensa. Se tarvitsee elääkseen ja kukoistaakseen
kansallisuuden kätkevän, kostuttavan, hedelmällisen mullan
juurilleen, tarvitsee huokuvan ja henkivän, auringon ja kosteuden
hedelmällisyydellä kyllästetyn kansallisen ilmakehän
lehvistölleen.

Kun nyt ruotsinkielinen sivistyneistömme, huolimatta kansallisesta ja
sivistyksellisestä pohjautumisestaan Suomen kansaan, antaa vallan
hetkellisille mielialakiihkoiluilleen ja tilapäisen nurjamielisyyden
sokaisemana johdonmukaisesti alkaa vieroittaa ja repiä itseänsä
irti kansallisesta yhteydestä Suomen kansaan ja suomalaiseen
yhteiselämään, niin kääntyvät tämän työskentelyn tuhoisat
seuraukset ensi sijassa sitä itseään vastaan. Kun se vähitellen on
vieroittanut mielestään, sammuttanut itsessään kansallisen
myötätunnon Suomen suomalaista kansaa kohtaan, kun se vähitellen
yhä jatkuvassa itseraasimistyössä on repinyt irti, katkonut ja
kuolettanut ne hennot sisäiset suonet, joiden välityksellä se on
tykkinyt yhtä elämää suomalaisen kansapohjansa kanssa, niin on se
samalla eristäytynyt elinlähteistään, itse tukkinut ne tiehykkeet,
joita myöten elämän lämmittävä elähyttävä mehu on virrannut
sille.

       *       *       *       *       *

Tämä eristäytyminen tapahtuu kahdella taholla, se on
eristäytymistä Suomen kansasta uuden veren lähteenä ja se on
eristäytymistä Suomen kansan sisäisistä elämyksistä uuden
henkisen aineksen lähteenä.

Kun säännöllinen, välttämätön veren uusiutuminen nuorilla,
kansapohjasta kohoavilla, vereksillä voimilla ehtyy sivistyneeltä
luokalta, kun se välitön, vaistottu, veriin eletty, niin sanoakseni
elämän animaalisen todellisuuden taju, jonka tämä nuori veri tuo
mukanaan kansameren tiedottomilta pohjilta, ei enää verestä ja
hedelmöitä tämän luokan elämänvaistoja, niin vapautuu tämä
pintaluokka kyllä siitä raskaasta sulatustyöstä, jolla tämä
yhtämittainen, ehtymätön uuden aineksen virta on omistettava ja
valloitettava jo olevan sivistyspiirin kehään ja omaksi, mutta
samalla ikäänkuin erillistyy ja irtautuu tämä luokka elämän
elävältä pohjalta.

Sivistyksen ilmakehä on keinotekoista. Syntyperäinen sivistysihminen
on sen kehässä tavallaan eroitettu todellisen elämän ulottuvilta
ja saavutettavilta, turvissa sen välittömyydeltä, eristetty
elävästä luonnosta: hän ei ole suoraan elämän kylmän
välinpitämättömyyden varoissa ja valloissa, hän ei
välittömästi riipu sen vaarallisesta odottamattomuudesta ja
epäluotettavuudesta, sen pakanallisesta epäinhimillisyydestä.

Sivistysihminen kasvaa ja muodostuu kotien suojaavien ja sulkevien
seinien sisäpuolella, kehittyy ja muovautuu kasvatuksen hoivaavan ja
valikoivan, yht'aikaa hillitsevän ja kannustavan, karsivan ja
kiihoittavan vaikutuksen alaisena. Palvelijoiden ja vahtimestarien
avuliaat kädet vapauttavat hänet kaikista ruumiillisen
itsepalveluksen ja itseavun kasvattavista vähäpätöisyyksistä;
elämäntottumuksissaan eläytyy hän katujen asfaltin ihanteellisesti
luotettavaan säntillisyyteen ja sen--kesken kaikkea sen kirjavaa
sähköisää vilinääkin--yksiviivaiseen yllättämättömyyteen,
eläytyy ravintola-, kylpylä-, matkailuelämän rahanpyörillä
liukuvaan siloiseen elämänmenoon--yleensä kaikkeen sivistyselämän
mekaanisesti helpotettuun, keinotekoisesti turvattuun, ikäänkuin
elämisen ulkopuolelle siirrettyyn ja projisioituun, käsitteiksi
ohennettuun ilmapiiriin. Koulu ja konttoori, opinnot ja työ
kehittävät ja kiihoittavat hänessä täsmällistä ja selkeätä
käsitejohtelua, abstrahoivaa elämäntarkastelua ja erittelyä;
kirjojensa, tilisarekkeittensa, paperiomaisuuksiensa mekaanisesti
monimutkaisissa ja kirjavissa, elimellisesti yksinkertaisissa,
selkeissä ja yllättämättömissä, ihmisälyn hallittavissa
käsitemaailmoissa tottuu hän näkemään elämänkin vain
käsitteinä, katselemaan ja tajuamaan: ei luontoa, vaan luonnon
luokiteltuja ilmiöitä; ravitsemaan mielikuvituksensa: ei
elämänilmiöillä, vaan elämänilmiöiden typistävillä,
väkivalloin selvyyden niukkaan pakkopaitaan kiristetyillä
määritelmillä; tavoittelemaan työllään: ei maan mullasta
ihmisponnistuksin ja -vaivoin kamppailtavaa ja luotavaa leipää, vaan
jo suoritetun ihmistyön valmista kivettymää, rahaa; nauttimaan ja
aistimaan: ei elämää, vaan taidetta, ei välitöntä luontoa, vaan
ihmisälyn siivilöimää luonnon kuvausta. Sivistysihminen on
sivistysilmakehän sovinnaisuuksien sekä kannattama että sitoma,
hän on sen piirissä suistettu ikäänkuin valmiille, teräksisille
raiteille, joita myöten on soljuvaa, kevyttä liukua, mutta jotka
myöskin jäykästi sitovat hänet puitteisiinsa. Sen piirissä joutuu
hän kaikissa elämänsuhteissaan välittömän paljaan
elämänkosketuksen ylä- ja ulkopuolelle, koko elämänkokemuksessaan
kauttaaltaan keinotekoisuuden varaan.

Minkä sivistysihminen täten on turvattu, sen hän myöskin on
ohennettu elämäntajussaan; minkä hän käsitteellisesti elämästä
selkeytyy, sen hän vaistoissa ja elämäntunnon välittömyydessä
niukentuu ja köyhtyy. Elämän vaikeuden, hankaluuden ja
vaarallisuuden ohella on häneltä mennyt menetyksiin elämän
kasvattava mahtikin. Ken ei joudu käsittelemään elämää
ikäänkuin omin paljain kourin, hän ei myöskään koskaan saa omiin
tarttuviin käsiinsä elävää tuntoa elämän todellisuudesta, sen
yli-inhimillisestä väkevyydestä, sen murtavasta voimakkuudesta ja
alttiisti taipuvaisuudesta: sen vastahakoisesta elävästä
muodostuvaisuudesta ihmiskäden ja ihmistahdon alla. Vasta se ihminen,
ken omin käsin on kamppailevassa taistelussa käsitellyt, muovannut
maan hengetöntä, hedelmällistä multaa; vasta se ihminen, jolle
elämä vielä on omin välittömin tajuin ja aistein koettua ja
elettyä, joka on ollut käsityksin ja silmityksin elävän luonnon
kanssa ja omien aistimustensa opettamana kokenut, että elämä ei ole
käsitteitä, vaan todellisuutta, että elämän kannattavana mahtina
ei ole pankista nostettava raha, vaan mullasta taisteltava ja
odotettava leipä, että ihmiselämä ei ole nauttimista ja
käsite-fantomien kekseliästä, ketterää sommittelemista,
johtelemista ja yhdistelemistä, vaan työtä ja luomista; vasta sille
ihmiselle, kenen mielikuvitus lapsuuden herkistä päivistä miehuuden
paisuvaan työponteen asti on ravittu läsnäolevalla, elävällä
elämällä, vasta hänelle avautuvat elämän todellisuuden aarniot
kaikessa versovassa hedelmällisyydessään ja kaikessa hyytävässä
pimennossaan, vasta hänellä on elämä elävänä tajussaan ja
veressään.

Melkein säännöllisesti ovatkin luovat henget kansan
koskemattomista, kuluttamattomista pohjahetteistä kohonneita
yksilöitä, jotka sieltä ovat tuoneet mukanaan koko tuoreen raikkaan
elämänväkensä ja -näkemyksensä, tuoneet sivistyksen paloon oman
rikkaan koskemattoman aineksensa. Ainakin ovat nämä luovat henget
tavallisesti peräisin sellaisista kansankerrostumista, joiden
elämänkosketus vielä on ollut välitön, joiden elämäntaju siihen
asti vielä on levännyt älyllisen itsetiedottomuuden horroksessa ja
harsoissa, ja joiden henkisen heräämisen ensimmäisiä esikoisia he
ovat: väkeviä, käyviä, täydestä, hurmahtelevasta, paisuvasta
elämänkosketuksesta ammentavia ja tuhlailevia. Nämä tällaiset,
elämän kuluttamatonta tarmoa ja luovaa hedelmällisyyttä uhkuvat
voimat elvyttävät sivistyksen: niiden nuori voima omistaa tämän
sivistyksen omakseen, tämä sivistys virkoo uuteen elävään
liekkiin heidän vereksessä aineksessaan, ja itse sivistyksen
sytyttäminä sytyttävät ja hedelmöittävät he vuorostaan koko sen
sivistyneistön ajatus- ja tuntemispiiriin, jonka kehään he ovat
kohonneet. Ja on huomattava, että tällaisia sivistyksen verestäjiä
eivät ole ainoastaan valtaisessa, suuressa merkityksessä
herättävät ja luovat henget, vaan kaikilla ihmistyöskentelyn
aloilla, vaatimattomissa, rajoitetuissa tehtävissäkin ahertavat
voimat, joilla vain on mahti kouraista elämän sovinnaisuuskehän
ulkopuolelle, elävään todellisuuteen, jotka voivat käsitellä
työtään hedelmällisesti, joille elämänilmiöt ja -tehtävät
ovat olevaa, kouraistavaa, väkivoimin muodostettavaa todellisuutta,
joiden vakava työnsuhtautuminen hedelmöittää ja pätevistää koko
heidän ympäristönsä työnsuhtautumista, jotka kautta koko
kansallisen työskentelyn rintaman verestävät työn todelliseksi.

--Jos nyt sivistyneeltä luokalta melkein tyyten ehtyvät tällaiset,
elämän todellisuuden ravitsemat ja kasvattamat,
elämäntodellisuuden kamaralta esiinponnistautuvat yksilöt, jos
siltä tyrehtyy se elämäntajun uusiutuminen, elpyminen, se
mielikuvituksen aineksellinen verestyminen ja rikastuminen, jonka
alinomainen uusien aineksien kohoaminen kansan pohjalta pinnalle tuo
tähän pintaan, niin kuihtuvat tämän sivistyneistön henkisen
elämän juuret. Missä sivistyneistö keinotekoisesti tulee
eristetyksi luonnollisista elähyttäjistään, siellä sen sivistys
on tuomittu vähittäiseen ohenemiseen ja tyhjenemiseen, siellä
liukastuu henkisesti vireinkin sivistyneistö näkemään ja
käsittelemään elämänä vain elämän pintaa, kuollutta kuorta,
seisahtunutta muotoa, jonka alta elämä toisinaan jo saattaa olla
väistynyt sykkimästäkin.

       *       *       *       *       *

Samaan suuntaan kuin eristäytyminen kansallisesta pohjasta uuden
veren lähteenä, samaan suuntaan vaikuttaa eristäytyminen
kansallisesta elämästäkin uusien elämyksien lähteenä. Sekin
eristäytyminen vaikuttaa sisällöllisesti ohentavasti, muodollisesti
kiihdyttävästi. Kun kansallinen yhteenkuuluvaisuus ei ole tajuttu
sellaisena elävänä, vaikuttavana voimana, että se kansallisen
myötäelämisen välittömiä teitä ja tiehykkeitä myöten
väkevästi ja vastustamattomasti ajaisi ihmishengen pohjaiset
elämänvoimat toimintaan, että se suuren, itsensä unohtavan ja
uhraavan rakkauden järkytyksellä kirvottaisi ja sulattaisi
liikkeelle ja hereille ihmisessä jähmettyneen sisäisyyden meren ja
sen arvaamattomat, kätketyt voimat, niin jäävät yksilöt tätäkin
elämällistä herätystä, tätäkin yksilöllisen
elämänsisältönsä laajenemista ja kasvamista vaille, jäävät
tietämättömyyteen heidän omiin olentoihinsa kätketyistä, heidän
tietoisaa itseänsä suuremmista rakkauden ja itseuhrauksen
alkuvoimista, eivät saa kokea sitä elämäntunnon laajentumista,
kohottumista ja kirkastumista, johon ihminen kypsyy uhratessaan
itsensä sille kokonaisuudelle, jossa hänen henkensä ja verensä
juuret ovat.

Jotta ihminen olisi hedelmällinen yhteiskunnan jäsen, satoisa
elävä elin yhteiskunnassa vaaditaan häneltä, ei käsitteellistä,
ohjelmallisesti selvää ja tietoisaa isänmaanrakkautta, vaan
elämällistä yhteenkuuluvaisuutta kansalliseen ja yhteiskunnalliseen
ympäristöön, välitöntä elämisen yhteyttä sen ympäristön
kanssa, jossa hänen elämäntyönsä tapahtuu. Välitön, ei
ajateltu, vaan vaistoinen rakkaus omaan kansaan, työ ja kärsiminen
sen kanssa ja puolesta, sen häpeän ja kunnian eläminen omassa
rinnassa omana nöyryyttävänä, syvempään itsetuntemukseen
leikkaavana häpeänä ja omana kannustavana, velvoittavana kunniana,
antautuminen sen elämänhengityksen läpitunkemaksi, sen toivojen
kohottamaksi, sen kamppausten terästämäksi, sen pyrkimysten
jännittämäksi, sen ihanuushurmioiden kirkastamaksi tulvahuttaa
yksilöön elämän elävän virran, joka täyttää hänen henkensä
sekä aineksen runsaudella että innon palolla, terästää ja
tiivistää hänen siveellisen tahtonsa, hedelmöittää ja
lämmittää hänen luovan mielikuvituksensa: antaa hersyvän
runsauden ja syvyyden, inhimillisyyden hänen elämäntunnolleen ja
elämännäkemykselleen. Kuten aalto vain meren povelta, meren
täyttämänä voi paisua ilmoja kohti, siten voi yksilökin vain
kansansa povelta, kansansa elonhengen kohottamana ja täyttämänä,
sen paisunnan hetkellisenä huippuna, kärkenä ja
voimanvyörähdyksenä singahtua täyteen ja terveeseen
elämäntietoisuuteen.

Kansallisesti eristäytyneet yksilöt ja kansallisesti eristäytynyt
sivistyneistö jäävät vaille sitä itsesyventymistä ja
itsekypsymistä, sitä rikkaampaan ja pätevämpään itsekokemukseen
kehkenemistä, jonka kansallinen myötäeläminen ihmisessä
virvoittaa. Yksilö, väkevinkään, enempää kuin erikoinen
luokkakaan, henkisesti virein ja viritetyinkään eivät kostamatta
irroittaudu pohjaltaan. Ken ei koko olemisellaan elä siinä
ympäristössä, jossa hän suorittaa elämäntehtäväänsä, ketä
eivät tajunnantakaiset, yksilön tietoisaa valintaa väkevämmät ja
sitä ehdottomasti hallitsevat yhteiselämisen tuntoliitteet ole
kiinnittämässä siihen elämänympäristöön, jonka piirissä hän
elämänsä kuitenkin elää ja työnsä joutuu suorittamaan, hän
erillistyy tahtoen tai tahtomattaan tästä ympäristöstä, elävän
rakastavan myötätunnon ohella ehtyy häneltä tämän rakkauden
antama hedelmöittävä, yhä suurempaan ponnistukseen ja
antautuvampaan työhön elähyttävä ja kiihoittava aineskin, ja
hänen työnsä surkastuu kuolleeksi työskentelyksi, ulkonaiseksi
työn suorimiseksi. Virkamies ja muu elämäntehtävänsä suorittaja,
joka toimii tehtävänsä vain virallisena toimen suorituksena, eläen
itse myötätuntoineen, harrastuksineen, elämänvaikutteineen
täydellisesti ympäristönsä elämänpiirin ulkopuolella, jopa
tälle ympäristölle ynseänä, ohjelmallisesti vihamielisenä ja
vierovanakin, ei voi saada oikeata sisäistä otetta tehtävästään.
Hän on yksilöllisesti työnsä ulkopuolella, ja suorittaa hän
työnsä kuolleella, muodollisella, mielikuvituksettomalla
ulkopuolisuudella. Hän ei elä ympäristöstään välittömästi
itseensä niitä elämyksiä, jotka hedelmöittäisivät hänen
työnsä, joiden varassa hänen elämäntyönsä kasvaisi
elimelliseksi, liittyisi elävästi ympäristön elämän- ja
kehityksentarpeisiin, mukautuisi, kasvaisi, elämällisesti rikastuisi
ja kehkenisi näiden tarpeiden mukana, kiihoittamana ja nostamana.
Hänen ja hänen tehtävänsä väliltä ovat ummessa rakkauden
suonet. Hänen sulkeva, vierova suhteensa elämänympäristöön
sulkee häneltä oman kasvamisenkin ainekset: työ, joka on ihmisen
tehoisin kasvattaja, jonka ponnistuksessa ihminen kasvaa itsensä
yläpuolelle, jonka kiihtyvässä jännityksessä ihminen kuin
kierrevihuri kerää ja imee itseensä ympäristönsäkin
elämänvaistot, -ainekset ja -voimat, tältä työn intohimolta on
kadonnut tarkoitus, elinedellytys ja aines, ja
elämänympäristöstään sulkeutunut ihminen jää yksilöllisessä
elämässäänkin vaille tätä työn siunausta, sen antamia
elähyttäviä herätteitä ja vaikutuksia, sen hedelmöittämää
elämänkokemuksen rikkautta, pätevyyttä ja syvyyttä.

--Kansalaisen isänmaanrakkaus on välitöntä yhteiselämistä siinä
yhteiskunnassa, jonka piirissä hän elää, ken tästä
yhteiselämästä itsensä irroittaa, hän tuomitsee itsensä sekä
itsekohtaiseen että yhteiskuntakohtaiseen hedelmättömyyteen, hän
kuihtuu ja kuolee sekä yksilöllisessä elämänsisällössään
että yhteiskunnan työelimenä.

Tällainen, joko omasta taipumuksestaan tai historiallisten
olosuhteiden painosta kansallisesta pohjastaan eristetty ja
vierautunut sivistyneistö vapautuu, kyllä välittömästi sille
virtailevan alinomaisen uuden ja alati uudistuvan elinaineksen
raskaasta omistamisesta ja sulattamisesta. Sen ei tarvitse
työläässä ja vaikeassa omistamistaistelussa oman valmiin
elämännäkemyksensä ja elämäntuntemuksensa kokonaisuuteen
jäljettömästi liittää niitä aina uusia, usein ristiriitaisia ja
vastahakoisia, aina rikkaita ja rikastuttavia elämänaineksia, jotka
kansallisen yhteiselämisen pohjalta virtailevat sille, sen ei
tarvitse niiden varassa kasvaa yhä kypsempään, syvempään,
pätevämpään ihmisyyteen. Se hengen ponnistus, minkä tämä yhä
uusien elämysten sulattaminen entiseen sivistyskokemukseen kysyisi,
säästyy täten puhtaasti muodollisen viljelyksen hyväksi. Henkinen
huomio ja muodostamistarmo kääntyy ja kohdistuu yksinomaisemmin,
vapaammin ja viileämmän jo saavutetun ja sulatetun elämänaineksen
henkistyneeseen, herkkään viljelyyn ja muodolliseen hallitsemiseen.

Mutta tällainen muotokultuurin hetkellinen nopea jouduttuminen on
ainoastaan näennäistä elintoiminnan kiihtymistä, aineetonta,
hedelmättömästi nopeaan lakastumiseen rientävää kuten juurestaan
leikatun kukkasen, joka veteen pistettynä kyllä nopeammin kehittää
teränsä auki kuin omalla varrellaan, mutta jonka kukoistaminen on
vain heloittavaa kuolemista, ei hedelmän kehäilemistä.

       *       *       *       *       *

Niin aineellinen kuin henkinenkin elämä on joka hetkistä
uudistumista; itse elämän sisältö, koko elintoiminta on
uudistumista: uuden aineksen alinomaista omistamista, sulattamista,
sen varassa uudeksi, yhä uudistuvaksi elämäksi palamista. Elämän
sisältö on taistelussa, omaksi omistamisessa, vieraan aineksen
väkevässä sulattamisessa oman elämän paloksi. Keneltä tämä
taistelu liiaksi helpottuu, kenen ei tarvitse syttyä pakottaakseen
vieraan, vastahakoisen aineksen sulautumaan hänen oman olentonsa
vaatimuksiin ja lakeihin, kenen ei tarvitse jännittää henkensä
tarmoa hallitakseen, elämäntuntonsa yksilölliseksi eheydeksi
muokatakseen häneen tulvivaa uuden elämän-aineksen virtaa,
häneltä menee taistelun ohella taistelemisen ainoa hedelmäkin
menetyksiin: eletty elämä.

Kuten väkevimmän, elävimmän elämänkäsityksen omistaa se
ihminen, totisimpaan, palavimpaan hengen tekoon voi kypsyä se
yksilö, joka on lähimmältä kuullut luonnon hengityksen, elänyt
luonnon, maan, elämän povella, tuntenut sen suonien sykinnän ja
solinan, omalla elimistöllään liittynyt tähän sykintään ja
solinaan ja tästä versovin sisäisin voimin luo tuntemuksensa muodon
kirkkaudeksi, samaten omistaa rikkaimman ja painokkaimman, jokaista
jäsentänsä sekä sitovimman ja velvoittavimman että
hedelmöittävimmän elämänsisällön se kansa, jossa sisäisyyden
suonet välittöminä ja runsaina sykkivät mehua pohjalta pinnalle ja
jossa pinnan muotoloisto on sisäisyyden veren lämmintä,
hengittävää kukintaa.

Missä sisäisen, uuden elon virtailu on ehtynyt tai ehtymässä,
siellä muuttuvat elämänilmiöt ikäänkuin irrallisiksi, ilmavan
kevyiksi. Kaikki kadottaa sisältönsä, kiinnekohtansa, leijaa
sisäisesti keventyneenä, virvailee satunnaisena muotojen
leikittelynä ja kimalteluna. Elämä häipyy tarttuvien käsien
välistä, elämältä katoo sisällön side, muotoansa etsivän,
muotoonsa pyrkivän aineksen sisältä käsin pakoittava, ajava mahti.
Elämän velvoituksenalainen raskas työntaistelu helpponee valmiiden
muotojen kokeilevaksi, keikailevaksi, leikkiväksi, melkeinpä
julkeaksi yhteensommittelemiseksi. Elämä eletään kevyemmin, kuin
elämän runsaus, moninaisuus ja syvyys ansaitsee. Itse eläminen,
elämisen tunto kadottaa vakavuutensa, ehdottomuutensa, velvoittavan,
ankaran ainokaisuusarvonsa.

Elämällä on se pettävä, helposti harhaan vievä ominaisuus, että
se näkyy vain sikäli mikäli katsojalla on silmää sitä
huomaamaan: ken sen kevyenä, helppona näkee, sille se onkin kevyt,
helppo ja mitätön; kenen silmä taas sulkeltaa syvemmälle sen
syiden ja salaisuuksien kudelmaan, hänelle se selkenee yhä
painokkaampana, vaikeampana, merkitsevämpänä. On riisto oman
elämän arvolta elää elämänsä liian helposti.

Tässä elämäntunnon rapistumisessa, höltymisessä, ohenemisessa on
selitys kansojen vanhenemiseenkin, kukoistavien sivistyskansojen
yht'äkkiseen tyhjenemiseen, kulumiseen ja rappeutumiseen. En usko,
että esimerkiksi kreikkalaisilta tai roomalaisilta niiden
rappeutumiskauden alkaessa kansalliset uusiutumismahdollisuudet vielä
olisivat tyyten ehtyneet; sivistys oli niiden keskuudessa kehittynyt
vain jonkinlaiseen umpikujaan: sivistyksen päivänvaloon kamppautunut
kansanosa oli erikoistunut tämän sivistyksen sisäisten
mahdollisuuksien etäisimpiin, erillisimpiin, hienoimpiin kärkiin ja
huippuihin, monisärmäisimmäksi kiteytynyt, hienoimmaksi hiottu,
arimmissa ilmiöissäänkin herkästi ja varmasti hallittu
muotokultuuri oli muodostunut niin monipuoliseksi ja
monivivahteiseksi, etäytynyt niin hiuksenhienoihin, sokkeloisiin
erikoisuuksiin, että sen ilmenemismuotojen ulkonainen omistaminenkin
riitti sekä kuluttamaan vahvankin henkisen työtarmon, että
ylipääsemättömänä juopana eroittamaan ja eristämään
sivistyksen muotoihin koulitun pintakerroksen pimeän muodottomuuden
syvänteissä uinuvasta kansapohjasta. Täten tapahtunut
eristäytyminen kyllä hetkellisesti helpoitti näiden sivistysten
yhä herkemmäksi kiihtyvää muodollista erikoistumista, mutta
samassa mitassa irkeni elämäntunto pohjaltaan: itse elämä höltyi
sisällisistä, pidättävistä siteistään, sisältö hupeni vain
muodoksi.

Täten sivistyksen elimistöön hiipinyt höltyminen turmeli
vähitellen siveellisesti arvottomiksi ja kestämättömiksi koko
nämä sivistyspiirit, ja ainoa pelastus, joka näillä kansoilla
sivistyskansoina vielä olisi ollut, joka olisi voinut syöstä
näiden kansojen sisäiset, tiedottomuuden onkaloihin tyrehtyneet
voimat uuteen, luovasti sivistykselliseen toimintaan, olisi ollut joku
näiden kansojen sisältä tapahtuva mullistus, senkaltainen
sisäisten, salassa olleiden kansallisten voimien esiinpurkautuminen
kuin oli esimerkiksi Ranskan vallankumous, joka vastaavanlaatuisissa
sivistysolosuhteissa mursi kansan pohjavoimat huuhtomaan kansan
kansallisen sivistyksen uudeksi.


       *       *       *       *       *




SIVISTYKSELLISIÄ LAATUPIIRTEITÄ.


Ruotsinkielinen yläluokkamme onkin juuri kansallisen ja aineellisen
eristäytymisensä ikäänkuin suljetun, suojaavan ansari-ilmakehän
turvin kehittänyt itselleen hyvinkin ilmekkään ja viljellyn, sekä
monivivahteisen ja elokkaan että täsmällisen ja joustavan
sivistyksen, melkein ylellisyyskasviksi vaalitun ja kehitetyn
muotokultuurin. Kielieron asettamaa keinotekoista, mutta
keskittävää ja kohdistavaa rajaa myöten tapahtunut, sukupolvilta
peritty ja sukupolvet kestänyt, jatkuva henkinen muokkaus on siinä
määrin tunkenut sen lävitse, että se kauttaaltaan on sävyttynyt
suhteellisesti hyvinkin vireään ja valveutuneeseen henkiseen
toimekkuuteen.

Sillä on kestävän viljelystyön taipuisaksi vaivaamassa ja
joustavaksi, kimmahtavaksi terästämässä hengessä ase, joka yhtä
tarkasti tähdätyllä asiallisuudella ja yhtä hairahtumattomalla
iskuvarmuudella voi kohdistua niin aineellisten elämänilmiöiden
leikkaavaan, järjestelevään käsittelemiseen kuin arkojen hengen
asioiden herkkään aistivaan tajuamiseenkin. Tämä luokka on niin
viljelty, älyllisen valveutumisen virittämä muodon kuri on
istuttanut siihen sellaisen tartunnan hienouden ja nopeuden, ryhdin
täsmällisyyden ja samatahtisuuden, että se kuin valmiiksi
pingoitettu jänneverkko antaa silmänräpäyksellisen vastakaiun
jokaisen henkisen herätteen sen kieliä koskettaessa. Onkin
ihailtavaa se vireys ja joustavuus, jolla tämä luokka hetkellisesti
sähköittyy henkisillä virtauksilla, se mallikelpoinen,
suhtaumisvalmis yhtäaikaisuus, jolla se virittyy hetkellisiin
mielialasuuntiin--koko se ryhmittymisen kuri ja salamannopea valmius,
joka sitä vallitsee. Mutta tämä sähköittyminen on vain pinnan
hetkellistä leimahtamista: mielialavirrat kylmenevät yhtä
silmänräpäyksellisesti kuin ne syttyvätkin, ja heräys haihtuu
jättämättä pysyvää hengen tekoa hedelmänään. Ruotsinkielinen
sivistyneistömme on kuin valmis, herkässä vireessä oleva soitin;
siltä puuttuu vain soitavaa, sisäisen sävelrikkauden tulviva vuo.
Siltä puuttuu se sisäisen ainesrikkauden tuhatkertaistava
kaikupohja, joka sitoisi ja pidättäisi herätetyn äänen
pysyväiseksi, joka hedelmöittäisi sen sisäänpäin paisuvaksi
monikertaiseksi sävelkuoroksi. Sen sivistykselliseltä herkkyydeltä
puuttuu kansallisuuden syvä kätkevä multakerros, jonka
hedelmälliseen verhoon sivistysvaikutukset voisivat lykätä juurensa
pysyäkseen elävinä ja versoakseen väkeviksi ja hedelmää
kantaviksi.

Ruotsinkielisessä sivistyksessämme ja sivistyneistössämme
huomaakin leikkaavan henkisen terävyyden ja älyllisen valppauden
ohella omituista löyhää, haihattelevaa pintapuolisuutta, melkein
naivia muodon ja näön palvontaa: pelkkään näköön, pinnalliseen,
muodolliseen näkösiloisuuteen takertuvaa ja tyytyvää
elämänilmiöiden ja -arvojen tajuamista. Ruotsinkielisen
sivistyneistömme ilmekkäimmät ja luonnehtivimmat piirit edustavat
melkein pintakiilloksi siloutunutta muodon huolittelua samalla kuin
sisäisen elämän taju, elämänilmiöiden sisäinen todellisuus ja
tosiasiallisuus melkein on häipynyt, ainakin surkastunut niiden
tietoisuudesta. Sivistysilmiöt ja hengenliikunnot jäävät sen
piirissä ominaisen irrallisiksi, seikkaileviksi, kokeileviksi,
häipyviksi. Niillä ei ikäänkuin ole ainesta, mihin sitoutua
ilmetäkseen olennaisina ja jäädäkseen pysyväisiksi.

       *       *       *       *       *

Erittäin edustavasti ja luonnehtivasti esiytyy tämä älyllinen
kouliutuneisuus ja elämäntajun yliaineksellinen keveys erinäisissä
ruotsinkieliselle sivistyneistöllemme luonteenomaisissa
ihmisryhmissä.

Sekä tieteen että liiketoiminnan, sekä virkamiesuran että
taiteellisen elämän ja arvioinnin aloilla tapaa runsaasti noita
vireitä, ilmekkäitä, nopeakäänteisiä henkilöitä, noita ripeän
sanan, teon ja silmän miehiä, joiden salamannopea katse
silmänvilauksessa muka leikkautuu eteensattuvien elämänilmiöiden
ytimiin, jotka kuin kämmenellä punniten silmänräpäyksessä ovat
selvillä eteensattuneen elämänilmiön arvosta tai arvottomuudesta,
jotka yhdellä katseella luulevat luokittavansa, lopulliseen lyhyeen
kaavaan jähmettävänsä elämän tuhatsärmäiset, tuhatsoluiset,
itsessään tuhannet idut ja mahdollisuudet kätkevät pienois- ja
yksilömaailmat ja jotka yhtäläisesti yllättävät koulitun
älynsä valmiudella kuin sisäisen elämäntajunsa
niukkapuitteisuudella ja keveydellä. Ollenkaan aavistamatta, että
mahdollisesti voisivat hekin nähdä elämän pienempänä, niukempana
kuin se on, että ilmiöiden tilapäinen ulkonainen valmius tai
valmiuden puute hetkellisesti olisi voinut häikäistä tai
hämmentää heidänkin silmänsä näkemästä pintaa syvemmälle,
pinnan ja luonnon kätkössä kukaties uinuvaa oleellisempaa
pätevyyttä tai tyhjempää pätemättömyyttä, suvaitsevat ja
rohkenevat he leikkiä kohtaloa ihmiselämälle ja elämän
värjyville ilmiöille, säätää niille--mikäli heistä
riippuu--peruuttamattomasti ne elämän asemat ja rajat, jotka heidän
itsevarma, itsehyväinen, mutta niukka, elämän moninaisuutta
arastelematon näkemyksensä on niissä hetken ja sattuman
vilauttamien tilapäävaikutelmien nojalla havainnut. Tämän
älyllisen, yht'aikaa sekä tarkan että niukan selkeyden ja valmiuden
henkisenä edellytyksenä on jonkinmoinen elämänilmiöiden
sisäisten arvojen, niiden arvaamattomien yksilöllisten
voimamahdollisuuksien eliminoiminen tajunnasta. Elämä on tullut
käsiteltävämmäksi sitä tietä, että vieraat elämänilmiöt
nähdään kevyempinä, niukempina, elämänarvossaan
mitättömämpinä kuin mitä ne ovat. Tällaiselle arvioitsijalle
typistyvät ja tyhjenevät elämänilmiöt pelkäksi fasaadiksi,
julkisivuksi, näöksi; kaikki sopeutuu ja supistuu hänelle lyhyeksi,
selkeäksi, kuivaksi kaavakkeeksi, jota on kevyttä ja ketterätä
käsitellä, mutta jota käsitellessä helposti haihtuu tajusta ja
tietoisuudesta, mitä elämänarvoja, mitä taistelun hyökyä, mitä
muodostumisen ja muodostamisen raskasta, palavaa kamppailua tällainen
elämän jättämä, itsetehottomaksi kutistunut elämänmerkki,
kuollut, jähmettynyt muoto kätkee ja edustaa itsessään.

Tämä elämällisen myötätunnon surkastuminen, sisäisen
elämännäkemyksen ehtyminen, välittömän elämänliitynnän
höltyminen kirvoittaa kyllä hetkellisesti älyn voimat kepeiksi ja
irrallisiksi, vapauttaa ne sisällön sitovasta raskaudesta ja antaa
niille ikäänkuin itsenäisen, ilmavan itsemääräämiskeveyden ja
riippumattomuuden, mutta sisällön raskauden ohella tyhjentyy
elämännäkemykseltä sisällön hedelmällisyyskin, se elimellinen
kasvu- ja uusiutumiskyky, jolla itsetiedoton elämänvaisto sisäisen
elämänliitynnän juuria myöten kokoo ja luo alati uutta ainesta
hengelle, liittää ihmishengen elämän hersyville lähteille ja
antaa sen niistä juoda elämäntajunsa, paisua elämäntäydeksi.

Tästä johtuu se yllättävä keveys, se keveyden kimmoisuus, jolla
nämä ruotsalaistemme ilmekkäimmät ja edustavimmat piirit
suoriutuvat monista elämän raskaista, työläistä tilanteista ja
kysymyksistä. Tästä johtuu se nopeus, valmius ja tarkkuus, jolla he
silmänräpäyksessä ovat selvillä hetkellisen tilanteen
vaatimuksista, se niukka täsmällisyys, jolla he muodollisesti
arvioivat ihmiset ja elämänilmiöt; yleensä se muodon kuri, jolla
he pakoittavat elämän itselleen kuuliaiseksi. Mutta tästä samasta
lähteestä johtuu niinikään se siloisa ja siteetön, alati yhtä
ällistyttävä keveys jopa kevytmielisyys, jolla eräät älyllisesti
näköään vireimmätkin henget sen keskuudessa altistavat
notkistuneen älyllisen viljelyksensä ympäristönsä mielialojen ja
mielihalujen palvelukseen, se luonteeton mieskohtaisen vakaumuksen ja
elämänarvioinnin itsekielto, jolla he lainaavat hienoksi hiotun
henkensä aivan tukalasti arkisten, pintapuolisten ja töykeästi
itsekkäiden pyyteiden ja intohimojen aseeksi.

       *       *       *       *       *

Ruotsinkielisen julkisen yhteiselämän tarkkaajalle ovat tässä
suhteessa psykologisesti aina yhtä yllättäviä ja mielenkiintoisia
eräät sen piireissä runsaasti esiytyvät, näennäisesti aivan
vastakkaisia luonnepiirteitä itsessään kätkevät yksilöt.
Lukuisat ovat heidän keskuudessaan nuo pirteät älyniekat, jotka
ilmekkäällä, elokkaalla yksilöllisyydellä tarpeen tullen sekä
virkeästi ja sukkelasti että suolaisesti ja kirvelevästi voivat
yksityiskohdissa iskeytyä jokaiseen asiannikamaan, penkoa ja seuloa
jokaista asiaa armahtamattomalla, tiukalla kriitillisyydellä ja
asiallisuudella, kaikella mahdollisella yksilöllisellä kiinteydellä
ja vastasukaisuudella; heidän lausuntonsa voivat säihkyä aivan
kritiikki-ilotulituksina, joissa väitteet ja vastaväitteet
singahtelevat terävinä, sattuvina ja asiallisina. Ja kaiken tämän
älyllisen yksilöllisyyden ja monisärmäisyyden rinnalla ja
vastakohtana sitte se yllättävä, hairahtumaton joukkorytmiikka, se
näköpiirin samakulmaisuus, se asiallinen yhdenmukaisuus, johon
nämä niin uhkareippaat älysissit, »frondeurit» lopulta kuitenkin
aina sopeutuvat ja mukautuvat muun tasaisemman joukon kanssa, kun
tulee äänestyksen, päätöksen tai muun tositoimen hetki! On kuin
kaikki tuo terävä, virkeä yksilöllisyys, arvostelun ja
näkökannan omintakeisuus olisi vain älyllistä voimistelua, leikki- ja
näköliikettä suoritettu hengen hygienian ja pirteyttämisen
vuoksi--ellei se vain ole pelkkää dialektista silmänlumetta,
huomion tahallista eksyttämistä epämukavasta pääasiasta
tyhjänpäiväisempiin sivuseikkoihin. Mitään tekoon ja itsenäiseen
luonneteräkseen velvoittavaa mahtia ei sillä ole: ratkaisun
hetkellä kieltäytyvät kaikki, niin elokkaat kuin kankeat aivotkin,
niin kimmoisat kuin uniset tahdotkin, niin heränneet ja herkät kuin
turtuneet ja tylstyneet omattunnotkin yhtä kevyesti ja auliisti
omasta itsenäisestä, inhimillisestä arvosteluoikeudestaan ja
arvosteluvelvoituksestaan ja alistuvat kaikkine näennäisine
itsenäisyys- ja yksilöllisyyspuuskineen täydellisen
myötäsukaiseksi äänestyskarjaksi tai laumamielialojen alttiiksi
kaikupohjaksi--olkoot sitte joukkomielialat miten yksipuoliset ja
hetken kuohun sokaisemat tahansa tai äänestyksen alaiset asiat miten
asiallisesti epäoikeutetut tai perustelemattomat hyvänsä.

Tämä, sanoisiko ryhmä- ja puoluekurin kannalta ihailtava, sanoisiko
inhimillisen yksilöllisyyden kannalta siveellisesti tyrmistyttävä
keveys, jolla yksityistahdot ja yksityisvakaumukset kieltäytyvät
itsenäisestä elämänilmiöiden arvioimisesta ja mukautuvat
ryhmänäkökantojen mukaisiksi, on yleisenä määräävänä
laatupiirteenä ruotsinkielisen sivistyneistömme suhtautumiselle
julkiseen elämäämme. Ken tarkkaa asioiden käsittelyä
ruotsalaisissa valtuustoissamme ja johtokunnissamme,
ruotsinvoittoisissa yhdistyksissämme, yleensä ruotsinkielistemme
julkisessa esiytymisessä silloin kuin jossakin--vaikka kuinka
etäisessä--suhteessa heidän luokka- ja puolue-etunsa ovat
kysymyksessä, saa aina hämmästymisen aihetta huomatessaan, kuinka
siloisesti näköjään itsenäisimmät, siveellisesti
ryhdikkäimmät, henkisesti valppaimmatkin älyt ja luonteet
ehdottomasti ja tahdottomasti kaikessa taipuvat puoluekurin mukaan.
Olkoon kysymyksessä miten räikeä yksityiselle tai asialle tapahtuva
oikeusloukkaus tai ajatuksenväkivalta hyvänsä, käyttävät he
henkensä lahjoja korkeintaan, ei tämän oikeusloukkauksen
torjumiseksi ja vastustamiseksi, vaan sen loukkaavan alastoman
räikeyden peittelemiseksi--jopa näkösyiden keksimiseksi tällaista
tekoa puolustaakseen.

       *       *       *       *       *

Kaikilla aloilla, missä ruotsinkielisillä meillä on ratkaisuvalta
ja missä heillä on tilaisuus käyttää tätä ratkaisuvaltaansa
suomenkielisiin nähden, esiytyy aivan naivisti ja peittelemättä
tämä näköään tuiki päätön ja silmitön, sanoisiko
siveellisesti häikäilemätön vai siveellisesti ryhditön liukuminen
puoluekurin vanavedessä: kaiken itsenäisen ja asiallisen arvioinnin
alistaminen puolue-ennakkoluulojen ja -pyyteiden määrättäväksi ja
palvelukseen. Suomenkielinen kansalainen joutuu melkein
säännöllisesti poljetuksi oikeuksissaan ja ansioissaan, milloin
hänen ansionsa tulevat ruotsinkielistemme arvioitaviksi, varsinkin,
jos niitä on punnittava jonkin ruotsinkielisen ansioita vastaan.
Voisi esittää lukuisia kuohuttavia oikeusloukkauksia, joita
ruotsinkielisemme ovat turtuneen joukkoitsehyväisyytensä turvissa
nukkuvin omintunnoin tehneet suomenkielisille tässä maassa, ilman
että ainoallakaan yksilöllä olisi heidän keskuudessaan ollut
siveellistä itsenäisyyttä ja ryhtiä nousta tällaista vääryyttä
vastaan.

Räikeimmän ja valaisevimman esimerkin tästä ruotsinkielistemme
luonnepiirteestä tarjoavat useat yliopistomme opettajaviroista
suoritetut taistelut ja yleensä se häikäilemätön, keinoista
välittämätön sitkeys, jolla ruotsinkielisemme ovat koettaneet ja
edelleen koettavat mahdollisimman kauan säilyttää tämän
suomalaisen sivistyksen sydänelimen vierashenkisenä ja
vieraskielisenä suomalaiselle sivistykselle.

On suorastaan siveellistä itsenöyryytystä havaita miesten, joiden
äly on viljelty ja terästetty käsittelemään hengen asioita
arimmalla, huojumattomimmalla tarkkuudella, joiden henki on koulittu
vilpittömässä, velvoituksenalaisessa työssä noutamaan ja
kirvoittamaan esiin elämän sokkeloista elämän todet lait, toden
sisällön, joiden uurastavaa, itseuhrautuvaa, toisinaan terävää,
syvyyksiinkin leikkaavaa työtä on kunnioittanutkin, havaita näiden
yht'äkkisessä laumahurmiossa liukuvan kuin kevyt kaarna joukon
mukana ja alentavan henkensä jalon aseen pintapuolisten ja
silmänräpäyksellisten puoluepyrintöjen auliiksi palvelijaksi. On
loukkaus ihmisluonteen ja ihmisvakaumuksen siveellistä arvoa vastaan
alentua hengen asioissa muodolliseksi asianajajaksi, loihtia
dialektisen taituruuden ja notkeuden avulla näkö- ja tekosyitä
asioiden ja tekojen perusteluksi ja puolusteluksi, joiden takana ei
kuitenkaan asiallinen ja luonteellinen vakaumus seiso--ei ainakaan
saata seista, jos on valveilla sokaisematon henkinen arvostelukyky ja
vääjäämätön siveellinen omatunto.

Se yksityistahdoista limittynyt, mutta jokaisessa yksilöllisessä
kohdassaan horjumaton yksimielisyyden valli, jonka ruotsalaisemme
yliopistossa muodostavat suomalaisuuden kaikkein oikeutetuimpiakin
vaatimuksia vastaan ja jonka kuurolle juurelle suomalaisen sivistyksen
välttämättömät ja polttavat tarpeet saavat tehottomina pauhata ja
raueta, on selitettävissä vain siten, että elämän arvot ovat
tälle älyn ylimystölle keventyneet ja että se senvuoksi niin
kevyen vapaasti, melkein itsetiedottomuuden viattomuudella voi
leikkiä huimaavaa leikkiänsä todellisuuden kanssa. Se seikka, että
suomalaisen sivistyksen ahjossa suomenkielinen nuorukainen--jos hän
osoittaa terävämpää tieteellistä työskentelykykyä--heti
tieteellisen työskentelynsä alkutaipaleella saa ainakin eräillä
opintoaloilla kokea, että häntä katsotaan kuin vaarallista
tulokasta ja tungeksijaa, vastaista suomalaista stipendien ja
professuurien tavoittelijaa ja konsistoriossa äänestäjää, jonka
tielle jo ajoissa on viritettävä niin vaikeita ansoja ja
hankaluuksia kuin muodollinen säädyllisyys suinkin sallii, se
seikka, että _suomalaisessa_ ainoassa suomalaisessa korkeimmassa
opinahjossa opiskelijan _suomenkielisyys_ on se loukkauksen kivi,
jonka vuoksi hänen on langettava, ja että tällaista kuohuttavaa
kohtuuden ja oikeuden polkemista saattaa tapahtua koko samanmielisen
valistuneen opettajiston--ainakin vaikenemisella
osoitetulla--suostumuksella, se seikka osoittaa sellaista siveellisen
tajunnan heikkenemistä, sellaista mieskohtaisen ja yksilöllisen
vakaumuksen itsekieltoa, että se on mahdollista ainoastaan
sellaisille ihmisille, jotka ovat joutuneet niin etäälle
todellisuuden pohjalta, ettei se enää heidän henkeään ja tekojaan
sido ja velvoita.--Itse se teko, suomalaisuuden juurittaminen Suomen
kansan ainoasta korkeimman viljelyksen ahjosta, on jo sinään niin
huimaavasti paradoksaali, että siinä työssä voi viattomalla,
vilpittömällä mielellä uurastaa vain ihmisryhmä, jolle elämä on
kulunut pelkäksi estetisoivaksi ja dialektisoivaksi ajatuskokeeksi,
jota voi käsitellä ja taivutella täydellisen älyllisen mielivallan
mukaisesti.

       *       *       *       *       *

Mitä likeisimmässä sielullisessa yhteydessä ja vuorovaikutuksessa
edellä esittämieni luonne- ja laatupiirteiden kanssa on se ilmekäs
ja vivahderikas esteettinen ja älyllinen kultuuri, jota
ruotsinkielisen sivistyneistömme parhaimmisto edustaa. Ylen lukuisat
ja ilmettä antavat ovat sen piirissä nuo herkät, koulitut esteetit
tai ajatuksen muotoihin notkeasti, joustavasti harjautuneet, ripeät,
terävät dialektikot, joiden silmä tuokiossa älyää
hengenilmiöiden arat ja hienot varjostumat ja jotka kukin
yllättävällä varmuudella liitävät ajatuksen ja kauneuden
maailmojen ilmaulappoja--kukin tietysti henkisen mahtinsa mukaisiin
korkeuksiin tai etäisyyksiin--jokainen yhtä tarkoin, tasapainoisin
liikunnoin, yhtä joustavalla hallitulla ryhdillä, yhtä
huolestetulla, muotovalmiilla varmuudella.

He ovat terävät näkemisessä, nopeat älyävässä omistamisessa,
tarkat näkemänsä ilmaisemisessa; mutta tämä näkeminen,
omistaminen, ilmaiseminen sairastaa ominaista sisällön ohuutta ja
haurautta. Miten älyllisesti herkkiä he ovatkin ja miten hiottu,
valpas ja täsmällinen heidän katseensa onkin, ovat elämänilmiöt
kuluneet heille pelkän ulkonaisen huomioitsemisen esineiksi.
Elämänilmiöt eivät ole eletyt sisäisesti omiksi, eivät ole
vaikeassa ja vaikeudellaan kasvattavassa työssä taistellut
yksilöllisesti omistetuiksi, vaan on elämä jäänyt pohtivaksi,
arvioivaksi, jäsenteleväksi älyn ja maun herkutteluksi, irrallisten
yksityiskohtien aistikkaaksi, herkäksi, valppaaksi, mutta
valinnanvaraiseksi ja ulkokohtaiseksi vaalinnaksi.

Heidän elämäntunnoltaan puuttuu eletyn kokonaisuuden elimellinen
kiinteys ja yhtenäisyys. Herkistyneen kauneusvaiston ja tarkistuneen
ajatusponnen ohellakin puuttuu heiltä ikäänkuin pohja ja aines,
jossa tämä pirteä älyllisyys ja täsmällinen käsiteselkeys
saisivat toteutua saavuttaakseen muodon kiinteän ja kirkkaan
valmiuden ohelle sisällön painokkaan vaakavan mahdin. Näiltä
hienoilta yksilöiltä puuttuu se kansallisen kokonaisuuden ja
kansallisen yhteiselämisen antama summaton ainesmeri, se kansalliseen
kokonaisuuteen kätkeytyvä ja siitä noudettava elämysten
voimasäiliö, ehtymätön elämänlähde, joka jokaisena hetkenä
sisältäkäsin tulvahuttaisi ja tykkisi heihin uutta hersyvää eloa
ja elämänainesta, elähyttäisi käsiteselkeyden ja -varmuuden
lämpöisellä elämänymmärtämisellä, syventäisi herkän, notkean
hienouden hartaalla elämänuskolla ja -rakkaudella, antaisi hengen
leikkaavalle terävyydelle sisäisen, siveellisen tarmon--yleensä
antaisi koulituille, hengen tekoihin ja ponnistuksiin norjistuneille
voimille aineksen, jossa niiden mahdissa oleva muodon säihke ja teon
terävyys pääsisi toteutumaan.

       *       *       *       *       *

Erikoisen ilmekkäästi ja luonnehtivasti esiintyy tämä
aineksettomuus ja muodollisen valmiuden jousekas ponsi erinäisillä
taiteellisen luomisen ja aatteellisen harrastelun aloilla.

Ruotsinkielinen kirjallisuutemme on viime aikoina silmin nähtävästi
virinnyt. Sen sävyttävänä laatupiirteenä on ominainen
yksityiskohtainen sanarunouden liekehtivä kiinto, yksinäisten
sanojen tunnelmallisesti puhdas, selkeä ja täysi kaiku, ikäänkuin
taotun metallin helähdys. Sanat säihkyvät kuin ilmaan leimuvat
tähdet, äly sinkauttelee vilkahtavia salamoitaan, yksityiskohtainen
taituruus kimmeltää ja häikäisee. Erotiikka kiiluu ja
sävähtelee, henkevyys keikailee ja korskailee, ylimielinen
hirtehisyys ja tuhattulimmaisuus eleilee ja pokkuroi. Mutta tämä
kaikki on vain diletantista elämällä herkuttelemista, ei
taiteellista elämän luomista. Tämä liekehtivä ilmehikkyys palaa
vain kuin lentävä virvaliekki kuloheinässä polttavana, kuumana,
kiihkeänä, mutta hupenee silmänräpäyksessä lämpöä
jättämättä ohitse. Sen näennäinen, tuhlaileva hengen
vallattomuus ja vaitonaisuus ei ole omia voimiaan hurmehtivaa elämän
rehevyyttä ja rikkautta, vaan on se irrallista, haurasta, itseänsä
esteettisesti huumailevaa älyn ilottelua; se ei tulvi elämän tumman
paisuvan vuon hillittömänä vyörähdyksenä, vaan on se vain maljan
piukkojen kimaltavain reunojen sisäpuolelle sidotun viinin
hivelevää, helmeilevää poreilua.

Missä tämä älyllisesti tarmokas kirjallisuus saavuttaa
kirkkaimmatkin voittonsa, luo se teoksia, joiden kuritettu tyyli,
koottu, piukka sanonta, älyllisesti ryhdikäs ja kohdistuva
tehtävän pitely on kuin tiiveimpään, jaloimpaan jännitykseen
pingoitettu teräskaari, jonka alta vain puuttuvat kannattavat,
ilmoihin kohottavat pilarit--teoksia, jotka ovat kuin jaloimmaksi,
säihkävimmäksi kuvuksi taottuja ja kaareutuvia
haarniskarintakehiä, joiden väikkeen ja kiinteyden alla ja
sisältönä kuitenkin ammottaa vain tyhjyys, ei sykkivä, elävissä
voimissa läikähtävä ihmisrinta. Tällaisesta, ehkä vuosikausia
miehisellä älyllä taotusta ja hiotusta taideluomasta saattaa puhua
melkein aineettomuuteen hupeneva henkisen ilmakehän keveys ja
ohukaisuus. Tällä taituruuden tarmolla ei ole ollut veroistansa
ainesta toteutuakseen painavana, elämäntäytenä taideteoksena.
Tällainen taideluoma on rakennettu tyhjälle, se on elämän
konstruktioni, ei elämän paisuva, hallittu läike. Ja
pakoittavinkaan taide ei voi pusertaa, tiivistää tyhjää
elämänpitoiseksi.

Milloin tällainen, elämäntajultaan ja -kosketukseltaan suppea
kirjailu ponnistautuu aatteelliseen elämänpitoisuuteenkin, puuttuu
siltä elämänaineksen runsauteen, elämännäkemyksen
hedelmöittävään syvyyteen, avaruuteen ja totuuteen perustuva
elämää luova välittömyys ja erittelee, julistelee se tykkivän
elävän elämänkuvauksen sijasta retoorisin, paisutetuin mahtielein
ainoastaan ohjelmanomaista, teoreettista, ohuesti elettyä ja
tunnettua maa- tai rotuhenkeä.

Ruotsinkielisten yleisö- ja nuorisopiirien aatteelliset
harrastuksetkin kantavat erikoista, yht'aikaa niukkaa ja ylikypsää
leimaa. Näissä piireissä yllättää yhtä paljon henkisen
näköpiirin suppeus kuin näkemisen terävyyskin. Henkinen harrastus
on kireätä ja tiivistä, mutta aineksellisesti ohutta. Yhtä
suhdaton kuin on ruotsinkielisten yleisöpiiriemme kielteinen
kriitillisyys: niiden elämänarvojen ehdoton, tajuton kieltäminen,
jotka ovat heidän elämäntottumuksilleen vieraita, yhtä suhdaton on
näiden samojen yleisöpiirien myönteinen epäkriitillisyys: heitä
hyvittävien, itsekästen elämänarvojen ehdoton, ajatukseton
tunnustaminen.

Nuorukaiset, joiden rikkiviisaan arvostelun edessä ei mikään
aatteellinen, yliaineellinen kudelma kestä, joille elämän
siveellinen ryhti, kansalaisen velvoituksenalainen työn- ja
rakkaudensuhde siihen yhteiskuntaan, jossa hän elää: elämän koko
uhrautuva, itsensä unohtava, itsensä ylitse kasvava uskon ja
rakkauden rikkaus on pelkkää löysää sanojen rihkamaa, nämä
samat ylikriitilliset nuorukaiset virittyvät toisaalta mitä
alttiimmasti aivan löyhiin, efemäärisiin lauma-aatteisiin ja
ohuimpiin, ohimenevimpiin lauma-ailahteluihin. He pohtivat kireällä
fanatismilla ijänikuista »finländare»-kysymystään, harrastelevat
elämän vakaisimpana, ainoana käsittelyn ja kiivailun arvoisena
kysymyksenä, onko joku kielen käänne--miten sisällöllisesti
kuvaava ja käsitteellisesti oikeavivahteinen hyvänsä--fennisisminä
karsittava käytännöstä, kuohtuvat täydelliseen, riehuvaan
vesilasimyrskyyn siitä, onko ylläpidettävä ruotsinmaalaisista
näyttelijöistä koottua »kotimaista» teatteria, vaiko vaalittava
kotimaisilla voimilla »korkearuotsalaista» teatteritaidetta,
marssivat--nämä kaiken intoilun yläpuolella olevat
punssipöytäkriitikot--tiukimmassa, hartaammassa tahdissa mihin
aatteellisesti pingoitettuun, teennäisesti touhuttuun ja
tuloksellisesti tyhjään suurruotsalaiseen nuorisokokoukseen
hyvänsä.

Yleensä yllättää ruotsinkielisissä yleisöpiireissämme juuri
tämän yleisön kriitillinen kylmäkiskoinen asenne kaikkea
aatteellista hurmautumista vastaan ja sen samanaikainen aivan
päätön, jopa lapsekas huumautuminen kaikenmoiseen
tyhjänpäiväiseen aate- ja elämänsisältösurrogaattiin, sen
odottamaton pöyrähtäminen kaikenlaiseen ohueeseen,
sisällöttömään ja tarkoituksettomaan periaatehommasteluun ja
-hammasteluun. Tässäkin on vaikuttamassa elokas, toimekas, hanakka
äly, jolta vain puuttuu elämänaines paisuakseen näköharrastelusta
ja -hyörimisestä hedelmälliseen elämänkäsitykseen ja
elämänkäsittelemiseen.

       *       *       *       *       *

Älyllisen kehityksen ylimahti vaistoisampien, välittömämpien
elämänvoimien kustannuksella johtaa henkisesti niukemmissa
yksilöissä suorastaan kuivakiskoiseen, mielikuvituksettomaan
kielteisyyteen.

Jos jättääkin ruotsinkielisessä sivistyneistössämme sen
älyllisesti ja henkisesti viljellymmät yksilöt ja piirit, ja
siirtyy tarkastamaan tavallista porvarillista tasapintaa, tapaa siinä
aivan tukahuttavan näköpiirin ahtauden ja ilmattomuuden. Jos missä,
tapaa siinä aivan puhtaaksi viljeltyä filistealaisuutta ja paljainta
aineellisuuden palvontaa. Niin töykeä, sulkeva, ahdasnäköisyyden
silmälapuilla suojattu, itsehyväisyyden vallituksella turvattu kuin
tällainen keskipintainen ruotsinkielisen intelligensimme jäsen, voi
tuskin olla insulaarisesti itseriittävin englantilainenkaan. Mikä
vaatimattomimmassakin määrässä kohoo lähimmän, itsekkään
tähystys- ja tavoituspiirin piukkojen ja niukkojen rajojen ulko- ja
yläpuolelle, on näille aitofilistealaisille olematonta. He
suoriutuvat elämästä yksinkertaisimmalla ja lyhyimmällä keinolla:
kieltävät sen, mitä eivät tajua.

Näiden piirien kritiikki on niin säälimätön, että
yhteiskunnallisen elämän tekijöistä sen edessä saattaa
korkeintaan löytää armon raha, taiteellisen elämän ilmiöistä
operetti, elävät kuvat ja viimeinen muotilehti, ihmisten
keskinäisistä elämänsuhteista skruuvikumppanuus ja
punssi-istunto.--Heille on Othello vanhanaikuista, koomillisesti
paisutettua sanatohinaa, yhteiskunnalliset ja kansalliset
velvollisuudet korkeintaan naisyhdistyksille kuuluvia asioita,
siveelliset, eetilliset elämänarvot vanhojen Runebergin-aikuisten
setien pakinaa. Vasta »Iloinen leski» voi virittää heissä
taiteellisen tuntemisen kielet, vasta tuoreimman kurssinoteerauksen
lukeminen voi avata heille näköaloja elämän jännittävään
kudelmaan, vasta virkaylennysten ja -syrjäyttämisten aiheuttama
juonien punonta voi lietsoa ja kirvottaa heissä hereille
yhteiskunnallisen toimekkuuden tai siveellisen suuttumuksen
yli-itsekkäät vaistot. Jos tällaisella kultuuri-ilmestyksellä on
kontinentaalisia mielitekoja ja kokemuksia, kirpoaa hänestä
täysverinen elämänihantelijakin: Parisin asfaltti kasvaa hänelle
elämän symboliksi, Nizzan hotellit luonnonhurmion »tiptopiksi»,
tuoreimmalta nähty varieteediiva elämänveikeyden haltioittavaksi
hengettäreksi. Ainoana yliaistillisena, kiihdyttävänä
elämänongelmana saattaa tällaiselle--tavallisesti supisuomalaisesta
ympäristöstä lähteneen, vaurastuneen kauppiasisän tai -isänisän
aitoruotsalaiselle pojalle--olla, kutsuako itseään
»finsk-svenskiksi», »svensk-finneksi», »svensk-finländariksi»,
»östsvenkiksi» vaiko yksinkertaisesti vain »finländariksi» tai
»finlänningiksi». Mutta tähän nähtävästi i'änikuisesti
ratkaisemattomaksi jäävään ajatuspulmaan tuhlautuukin sitte
kokonaisten nuorukaispolvien henkinen pohdintatarmo ja -tarve.

Nämä tällaiset kuivakiskoisuuden fanatismissaan kaikelle
henkisyydelle tartuntavapaat henget tuntevat korkeintaan yhden ainoan
siveellisen johtotähden: millä hinnalla hyvänsä on vältettävä
näyttämästä nolatulta. Siitä syystä on yliolkaisesti oltava
uskomatta mitään, visusti vältettävä antamasta minkään seikan
viehättää itseään innostumiseen, kunnioitukseen, arvonantoon;
aina on kaikissa tilanteissa ja asianhaaroissa ennen kaikkea
säilytettävä irooninen, kylmäkiskoisesti halpeleva ylemmyyden
ilme. _Ja_ onnistuvatkin he tässä pyrinnössään toisinaan niin
hyvästi, saavat niin ilmanpitävästi suljetuksi itsensä kaikilta
elämän virikkeiltä, että he lopullisesti korkeintaan yhdessä
ainoassa seikassa joutuvat elämän puijaamiksi: omassa alastomassa,
rapautuneessa elämässään, omassa autiossa, tyhjässä
elämäntunnossaan.

       *       *       *       *       *

Ruotsinkielisessä sivistyneistössämme on kuitenkin siellä
täällä kyllä yksilöitä, joiden henkisen näköpiirin avaruus ja
ylemmyys, luonteen puhtaus ja ryhti, luova työtarmo ja työrakkaus
sekä yksilöllisen uhrautuvaisuuden voima kohottaa heidät heidän
ympäristönsä puitteista ja ennakkoluuloista.

Mutta nämä tällaiset valoisan, viileän, humaanisesti avaran
järjen miehet, lämpimän, hartaan sydämen, vilpittömän,
uskollisen tunnollisuuden miehet--työskennelkööt he taiteen tai
tieteen, yhteiskunnallisen tai yksityisen elämän piireissä,
näkyvillä julkiasemilla tai vaatimattomissa elämäntehtävissä--he
ovatkin elämäntehtäviensä suorittajina puhkaisseet itsensä
kielisympatiojensa asettamien rajojen ulkopuolelle, ovat särkeneet
sen hedelmättömyyden lasikehän, johon heidän ruotsinkielisyytensä
tässä maassa heidät on sulkenut ja kasvaneet työnsä suuruisiksi.
He ovat, vaikk'eivät he hakeudukaan suomenkieliseen sivistyspiiriin,
elämäntyönsä suorittajina ja toteuttajina joutuneet suomalaisen
sivistyselämän tekijöiksi: rakkaudella, harrastuksella ja
myötätuntoisella antaumuksella suhtautuessaan omaan työhönsä
joutuvat he rakkaudella, harrastuksella ja myötätunnolla
työskentelemään suomalaisen yhteiskunnan ja suomalaisen
sivistyselämän kehittämiseksi.

Nämä tällaiset, inhimillisesti lämpimät ja hedelmälliset henget
ovat, ei todistuksia siitä, että ruotsinkielisessä
sivistyneistössämme olisi vaikuttamassa elävä yhteisymmärryksen
henkikin suomalaisen yhteiskunnan elintarpeita kohtaan--sitä
todistaakseen ovat he liian poikkeuksellisia ja harvalukuisia--vaan
todistuksia siitä, että ruotsinkielinen sivistyneistömme
kokonaisuudessaankin, jos sillä olisi henkistä laajapiirteisyyttä
ja avaruutta, voisi uhraamatta hiventäkään enempää
ruotsinkielisyydestään kuin henkisen kultuurin
ylemmyydestäänkään elähyttävästi ja itse elähtyvästi lähetä
välittömään, luottavaan ja luottamusta virittävään
yhteistyöhön yhteisen suomalaiskansallisen sivistyksemme
kehittämiseksi.

       *       *       *       *       *

Läheisen ja valaisevan vertauskohdan ruotsinkieliselle
yläluokallemme tarjoavat sivistyksellisessä suhteessa nykyajan
juutalaiset. Kummankin keskuudessa on sama kansallinen juurettomuus,
irrallisuus siitä ympäristöstä, jossa he kuitenkin elävät ja
vaikuttavat, aiheuttanut samansuuntaisen henkisen tilanteen.
Kummallekin ovat tunnusmerkillisiä henkisen valmiuden ohella henkinen
köykäisyys, nopean ja ripeän sopeutumiskyvyn ohella hyvin
ulkonainen liittyminen elämän ilmiöihin, esteettisen ja älyllisen
muotokultuurin ohella ominainen elämännäkemyksen ohuus ja
aineettomuus, terävän, käytännöllisen, ulkonaisen
järjestämiskyvyn ohella omituinen pintapuolinen kaavamaisuus
elämän sisäisessä omistamisessa ja tajuamisessa.

Kummallakin on henkisen näkökulman, henkisen painopisteen
määrääjänä muotojen vanhoillisuus sisällön vapaamielisyyden
rinnalla: sitkeä, kireä, vaikkapa kiivailuun yltyvä taipumattomuus
entisten, totuttujen ja koettujen muotojen ja kaavojen noudattamisessa
ja säilyttämisessä samalla kuin siihen nähden, mitä nämä muodot
mahdollisesti kätkevät itsessään sisällöllisesti olennaista, on
vallalla aivan siveelliseen mielivaltaan ja henkiseen
välinpitämättömyyteen asti ulottuva ja venyvä suvaitsevaisuus;
kummallakin on hyvinkin näköisän, näennäisen vapaamielisyyden
rinnalla kirein, jäykin kaavaintoilu: älyn ja logiikan, ei sydämen
ja uskon suvaitsemattomuus. Kumpaakin luonnehtii melkein hermostuneen
herkäksi kiihdytetyn yksilöllisyyden rinnalla tyrmistyttävä
siveellisen itsenäisyyden ja ryhdin puute: juriidisesti muodollisen
ja kiivailevan sana- ja periaateratsastuksen rinnalla aivan luonteeton
yksilöllisen vakaumuksen taipuvaisuus, kun se joutuu johonkin
ajanhengen tai ympäristön ennakkoluulojen ja puoluepyyteiden
virta-uomaan, aivan siveelliseen tunnottomuuteen asti itsenäisestä
arvostelusta kieltäytyvä lauman ennakkoluulojen ja lauman
itsekkyyden kahleissa kulkeminen. Kummallekin on yhtä luonteenomaista
loogillisen, koulitun, melkein rikkiviisauteen asti valppaan
kriitillisyyden rinnalla aivan lapsekas ryöpsähtäminen hetkellisten
ohimeneväin ajanhengen muotipuuskausten ja pyörähdysten mukaan,
herkistyneen valitun esteettisen herkuttelun rinnalla mitä
vilpittömin ja karkein aineellisuuden palvonta.

Kumpikin on kehityksessään kohonnut niin ohutilmaisiin korkeuksiin,
etäytynyt niin kauas maan mehujen ylettyviltä, että
yksilölliseltä elämäntajulta on kadonnut kansallisen kokonaisuuden
ja elämänympäristön tasoittava, vakiinnuttava pohja: sen jos
sitova ja pidättäväkin niin myöskin teon ja ajatuksen kiinteyteen
ja johdonmukaisuuteen ajava ja pakottava sisällön ja aineksen mahti.

Elämänkosketuksensa ja sitä seuraavan elämäntajunsa rajoituksen
vuoksi ovat he kumpikin synnynnäisiä luokittelijoita
elämänilmiöiden muodollisia järjestäjiä. He suhtautuvat
elämään enemmän muodollisesti kuin asiallisesti, enemmän
älyllään kuin olennollaan, he huomioitsevat enemmän elämää kuin
elävät sitä. Elämä irtautuu heille vaistojen liitteistä ja
erillistyy yksinäisiksi tuokioiksi, erikseen, yhteydettä haratuiksi
yksityisilmiöiksi. He näkevät elämän pinnallisesti
selkeämpänä, mutkattomampana, suoraviivaisempana kuin mitä se on;
he typistävät sen elävät, vain oman yksilöllisen olemuksensa
arvaamattomista laeista aavistettavat ilmestykset muodollisen logiikan
ja matemaattisen joukkojärjestyksen pakkokaavoihin ja
joukkosarjoihin. He eivät käsittele elävää elämää: eivät
vaikeassa, kärsivällisessä työssä kehitä esiin, kasvata elämän
uinuvista iduista uusia, kehkeneviä elämänilmestyksiä, vaan
käsittelevät he valmiita asioita: mittaavat, punnitsevat,
luokittelevat lopullisen muotonsa saaneita esineitä.
Älynvoittoisuutensa harhassa johtuvat he näkemään elämän
elävät ilmiötkin juurettomina, valmiina, lopullisina esineinä: ei
elävinä, muodostuvina yksilöinä, vaan kategoorisina matemaattisina
yksikköinä, joita on yhtä kevyttä, luontevaa ja luotettavaa
käsitellä, sommitella ja summitella, läjitellä ja lajitella kuin
mitä kuolleita, pyöriviä metallikappaleita hyvänsä. Heille ei
elämän ikuisena tunnuskuvana häämötä pelto: maan vaivattava
hedelmällinen povi, jonka hetteistä uuraan ihmistyön on alati
uusiutuvassa vaivannäössä luotava alati yhtä uutta, odottamatonta,
alkuperäistä elämää; vaan on heille elämän elokkaimpana
tunnustähtenä raha: irrallinen, vierivä metalli, jonka helisevä,
kiirivä, kirkas liukkaus, mekaaninen, rajaton monistumismahdollisuus,
epäelimellinen, koneellinen, hengetön samanmukaisuus edellyttävät
vain muodollista, ei luovaa käsittelyä, vain matemaattista,
summittaista joukkoryhmittelyä, -luokittelua ja karsinoimista, ei
yksilöllisen olemuksen sisäistä, altista, noudattavaa näkemystä
ja tajuamista ja jonka hallitsemiseen ja vallitsemiseen ei tarvita
työtä, vaan taitavuutta. Kumpikin on etäytynyt liika etäälle maan
mullasta, josta ei mikään elävä kostamatta saa juuriansa
irroittaa: aines on ehtynyt sydämeltä ja ajatukselta, veren vaistot
haalenneet, elokas, ketterä äly enää vain työskentelee liukkaana,
liikkuvana, nopeana kuten aina järjestellen, arvostellen,
päätellen, mutta järjestellen, arvostellen, päätellen ei eläviin
muotoihin herätettävää, vangittavaa, muodotonta elämää, vaan
valmiita ilmiöitä, valmiita esineitä, valmiita arvoja, käsitellen,
sijoitellen, korkoja kasvatellen, keinotellen sivistyksen ja
aineellisen varallisuuden valmiilla, keräyneillä pääomilla.

KANSALLISEN POHJAN ETSISKELYÄ.


Ruotsinkielinen yläluokkamme on itse herännyt tämän kansallisen
juurettomuuden ja sen aiheuttamain henkisten ja siveellisten vaarojen
tajuun ja alkanut etsiä kansallista maaperää jalkojensa alle. Mutta
se on lähtenyt hakemaan tätä maaperää, ei altansa, suomalaiselta
pohjalta, josta se todella löytyisikin, vaikka sankan ja sakean
ennakkoluulokerroksen eristämänä ja kätkemänä, vaan jostain
sivummalta, etäämpää.

Eräät luulevat ilmajuurilla voivansa liittyä Ruotsin jaloon ja
ylvääseen kansaan, luulevat voivansa ruotsalaisen kansayhdyskunnan
elonilmauksista, kansallisesta verestymisestä ja nuortumisesta,
yhteiskunnallisesta elpymisestä ja henkisestä elokkuudesta johtaa
eloa Suomen ruotsinkieliseen yläluokkaankin.

Tämä on kuitenkin kaikkien älyihmisten ainaista, yhtä nokkelaa
kuin naiviakin elämän tosiasiallisuuden tajuamattomuutta. Elämää
ei voi lainata, sen on palettava niissä aineksissa, jotka kullakin
ovat itsessään. Kansojen kuten ihmistenkin on luotava
elämänvoimansa omassa elimistössään. Kansallinen
yhteenkuuluvaisuus ei ole sanoja, ei edes kauniita sanoja, vaan
jokapäiväistä, yhteistä henkistä tai aineellista, tietoisaa tai
tiedotonta työtä yhteiskunta-elimistön hyväksi: elämistä
yhteiskunnassa. Kansallista vireytymistä ei voi sinään siirtää
sen yhteiskunnallisen elimistön ulkopuolelle, jossa se vaikuttaa. Se
voi korkeintaan esimerkillään ja hengellään herättää ja
tartuttaa, mutta teon ja toimen voimana jää ja sulkeutuu se
jäljettömästi siihen elimistöön, jonka elintoiminnan tulos se on,
kiertää ja elostaa vain sitä elimistöä, joka sen on pusertanut
elämänaineksistaan ja jonka suonissa se virtaa.

Yhtä hauraan, haaveksivan itsepetoksen uhriksi kuin jos poteva
alkaisi odottaa, että vieraassa elimistössä sykkivä väkeväkin
elonveri voisi mekaanisesti häneen siirrettynä elvyttää hänen
kuihtuvan elimistönsä laimenevat voimat, yhtä hauraan itsepetoksen
uhriksi joutuisi se yhteiskunta tai yhteiskunnallisen elimistön osa,
joka odottaisi yhteiskunnallisen elämänsä elpyvän vieraassa
elimistössä--vaikka kuinka elokkaina--sykkivistä voimista.
Ruotsalaiskansallinen elinvoima--mikäli sitä on--Ruotsin kansan
luova yhteiskunnallinen tarmo, aineellisen työn toimekkuus,
kekseliäs monipuolisuus, asianmukaisuus ja sitkeys, henkisen
harrastuksen virkeys toteutuu ja voi toteutua ainoastaan
ruotsalaisessa aineistossa, luo Ruotsin kansan yhteiskunnallista
järjestymistä ja kehkenemistä, Ruotsin kansan aineellista
vaurastumista ja toiminnallista tehostumista, Ruotsin kansan
syvempää ja eloisampaa henkistä viljeltymistä ja itsetietoon
heräämistä. Suomen ruotsinkielisellä sivistyneistöllä ja Ruotsin
kansalla ei ole keskenään mitään yhteistä, yhteiskunnallista
luotavaa ja rakennettavaa, ei mitään yhteisen työskentelyn
liitettä, eikä senvuoksi hyvää tarkoittavinkaan harrastelu voi
loihtia tyhjästä niiden välille mitään kestävämpää,
vakuutetumpaa, syvemmälle vaikuttavaa ja teoissa itsensä todistavaa
ja toteutuvaa kansallista yhteiselämistä.

Eräiden haaveellisten ruotsalaispiiriemme unelmoima jonkinmoinen
ruotsalaiskansallinen renessanssi, joka aiheutuisi ruotsinkielisen
sivistyneistömme myötätuntoisesta eläytymisestä ja
lähestymisestä Ruotsin kansan kansallisiin liikuntoihin ja
virtauksiin, onkin avuttomassa lapsellisessa utopistisuudessaan ja
herkkätoivoisuudessaan lähimmin liikuttava. Kun kuulee tällaisen
lähestymisen ilahuttavina merkkeinä ja todistuksina uskollisesti
luetelluksi ja aikakirjoihin viedyksi jok'ainoan huvi- ja
virkistysmatkan, jonka nuoriso puolelta ja toiselta on suorittanut yli
Pohjanlahden, ja jok'ainoan illanvieton, mikä heillä on yhdessä
ollut ja näitten--ja vain näitten!--viattomien tilaisuuksien nojalla
näkee vedetyksi mitä kauaskantoisimpia ja siintävimpiä
johtopäätöksiä kansallisesta veljeytymisestä ja tulevasta
hedelmällisestä kansallisesta yhteistyöstä näiden juhlijain
välillä, niin ei voi olla hymyilemättä sille lapsellisen hartaalle
herkkäuskoisuudelle ja tosielämän tajuamattomuudelle, joka näissä
niin löyhästi pohjatuissa ja pohjattavissa odotuksissa
kuvastaikse.--Sitä tietä ja siitä touhuilusta ei voi syntyä kuin
kauniita maljapuheita ja asianomaisille kauniita, vilkkaita
nuoruudenmuistoja vanhuuden päivien varalle. Kansallista,
elimellistä yhteistuntoa ei voida saavuttaa intoisimmallakaan ja
kuohuvasanaisimmallakaan kansallispuku- ja punssiromantiikalla, se on
rakennettavissa vain koko yksilöllisen ihmiselämän kestävässä ja
isältä pojalle perityssä ja perinnöksi jätettävässä
koruttomassa, uuraassa työssä yhteisen yhteiskunnallisen
kokonaisuuden kehittämiseksi.

Ponnettomassa kaihomielessä tähyilee osa nykyistä ruotsinkielistä
nuorisoamme ruotsalaisen yhteiskunnan elinilmiöihin, elää
mielikuvituksessaan ruotsalaista yhteiskuntaelämää, tuijottaa
itsensä sokeaksi nuoren ruotsalaisen kirjallisuuden tukholmalaisiin
tapainkuvauksiin, tuntee itsensä kotiutuneemmaksi Tukholmassa kuin
Helsingissä, istuu Kappelissa, mutta haaveilee itsensä
Hasselbackenille.--Tällainen mielikuvituselämä voi kuitenkin
kääntyä tuhoisaksi tälle nuorisolle. Heiltä katoaa ote elävään
suomalaiseen yhteiselämään, mutta he eivät kuitenkaan pääse
todelliseen luovaan ja työtätekevään elämänsuhteeseen
ruotsalaiseen yhteiskuntaan: he hylkäävät elämäntehtävän
täällä, mutta eivät saa elämäntehtävää sieltä. Hoippuessaan
kahden yhteiskunnan välillä, joista toisessa elävät heidän
mielihaaveensa, mielikuvituksensa, toisessa tapahtuu heidän työnsä,
joutuvat he kummankin näiden yhteiskunnan todellisen elämän
ulkopuolelle, jäävät mielikuvitustensa pilaamiksi
tyhjänpäiväisyyksiksi, jotka kummallakin taholla ovat yhtä
hyödyttömiä ja joiden ainoana elämänsisältönä on hipuva
tyytymättömyys ja tuhattulimmaisuutta näyttelevä vetelehtiminen
(dagdrifveri).

Ruotsalaisen yhteiskunnan täysveroiseksi jäseneksi eivät
ruotsinkielisemme ikinä voi tuntea itseänsä niin kauan kuin he
eivät välittömästi elä ja työskentele tässä yhteiskunnassa.
Parhaimmassakin tapauksessa katsotaan ja kohdellaan heitä siellä
kuin siedettyjä, huonoihin olosuhteisiin joutuneita, armopaloilla
eleleviä, epämukavia sukulaisia, joiden kovaa kohtaloa
hyväntahtoisesti säälitellään ja surkutellaan, mutta joilta
evätään luonnollinen, itseoikeutettu ja tasa-arvoinen kansaperheen
jäsenyys. Niinpä voi ruotsinkielisen yläluokkamme suhde Ruotsin
yhteiskuntaan ilmetä vain liehivänä, nöyrtyvänä ihasteluna, ei
luovana yhteiskuntatyönä.

Siinä määrin on tämä pelkkä vastaanottava, mukautuva,
hedelmätön suhtautuminen ruotsalaiseen yhteiskuntaan tenhonnut
ruotsinkielisen yläluokkamme, etteivät sen jäsenet tohdi
luonnollisesti ja välittömästi käyttää edes omaa perittyä ja
oman elämäntuntonsa muovaamaa kieltänsäkään henkensä
ilmaisijana, vaan kyhäilevät he ajatuksensa ja tuntemuksensa
sanoiksi ja lauseiksi kourassa sanalista ja sydämessä joka hetki
vavahtava, herpaseva säikähdys: olleeko tämäkin tuntemus
karsittava kielestä epäruotsalaisena? pitänevätkö hienot
puoliserkkumme Ruotsissa tätäkin fennisisminä?

       *       *       *       *       *

Vakavampi, todellisempi ja myötätuntoon virittävämpi on eräs
toinen, edellisen kanssa rinnan käyvä mielialavirtailu
ruotsinkielisessä sivistyneistössämme: kääntyminen ruotsalaiseen
kansa-asutukseen maassamme, pyrkimys pohjautumaan kansallisesti
siihen.

Missä tämä pyrkimys on välitöntä, luonnollista
yhteenkuuluvaisuutta, sellaisten henkilöiden lämmintä paikkakunta-
ja kotiseutuharrastusta, joita alkuperä, toimiala tai joku muu
välitön elämänsuhde liittää läheisesti tähän ruotsinkieliseen
asutukseen, siellä on se pelkästään ilahuttava ilmiö. Sellaisille
tämä liityntä on välitön sydämen teko, ei nokkelasti harkittu
poliittinen laskelma ja sellaisille se myöskin muodostuu eläväksi,
rakastavaksi työksi, ei kuolleeksi ohjelmapykälän kirjaimeen
vannomiseksi. Tällaiset henkilöt tulevatkin tämän rakkautensa
tietä todelliseen elämänkosketukseen kansan kanssa, ja saavat he
tästä välittömästä, ravitsevasta kosketuksesta henkeensä sitä,
mitä ruotsinkieliseltä sivistyneistöltämme yleensä puuttuu:
yksinkertaisen, koruttoman ja luonnollisen elämäntajun. Nämä
kansallisesti virittyneet ja värittyneet henkilöt ovatkin yleensä
ruotsinkielisen sivistyneistömme luonnollisimpia ja positiivisimpia
yksilöitä, eikä heiltä voi evätä oikeutettua myötätuntoa
sekään huomio, että paikkakunnalleen ja kielellinen erikoisrakkaus
usein tuntuu hämmentävän heiltä kyvyn tajuta yhteiskunnallisen
kokonaisuutemme elintarpeita ja -vaatimuksia.[2]

Vilpittömässä ja yhteiskunnallisesti oikeutetussa muodossa onkin
tämä maamme ruotsinkieliseen asutukseen kääntynyt harrastus vain
kotiseututunnetta ja kotiseutuharrastusta vailla historiallisen,
sivistyksellisen ja ennen kaikkea yhteiskunnallisen kokonaisuuden
taustaa. Ruotsalainen asutus maassamme ei muodosta itsenäistä
yhteiskunnallista kokonaisuutta, sen muodostavat alueellisesti,
historiallisesti ja sivistyksellisesti toisistaan irtonaiset
paikkakunnat, joiden yhteiskunnallinen kokonaisuus on Suomessa, ei
toisissaan. Ne eivät voi rakentua toistensa varaan muodostaakseen
eheämpää ja täyteläämpää kokonaisuutta kuin ne kukin jo
itsessään ovat: ne ovat oksia, jotka yhteiskunta-elimistön osina
jokainen erikseen liittyvät välittömästi yhteisrunkoon, Suomeen,
sitä ennen liittymättä toisiinsa. Senpävuoksi ei niiden kesken voi
yhteisen yhteiskunnallisen työskentelyn varassa kehittyä ja vakiutua
luonnollinen välitön yhteishenki, vaan on semmoinen viritettävä
keinotekoisesti: juhlien, puheiden ja aatteellisen kiihoitustyön
alati uudistettavalla ja tosiasiain tielle sattuessa alati turhaan
suoritetulla lietsomisella.

Sitäpaitsi on tämmöinen, olosuhteiden pakosta vain
paikkakunnallinen kotiseutuharrastelu ruotsinkielisen
sivistyneistömme runsaalle ja hallitsevalle enemmistölle aivan
vieras ja keinotekoinen aatesuunta. Lukuunottamatta näitä
esittämiäni lämminsydämisiä, mutta henkisesti rajoitettuja
kotiseudunystäviä--semmoisia ovat pelkät kotiseutuharrastelijat
kuten muutkin vannoutuneet erikoisaatteilijat aina--on tämä niin
sanoakseni etnografis-romanttinen kansallinen heräämys ja kokoomus
enimmille ruotsinkielisen yläluokkamme jäsenille vain joko kevyt ja
ohimenevä, ailahtelevien joukkomielialojen aiheuttama muotioikku tai
keinotekoista poliittista laskelmaa, enemmän teoreettisen
järkeilemisen perustuksella hyödylliseksi ja tarpeelliseksi
pääteltyä toimintamenetelmää kuin välitöntä ja elettyä
yhteis- ja kokonaisuustuntoa. Koko yritys loihtia itsenäistä
kansallista yhteiskuntatuntoa ruotsinkielisen virka- ja
liikemiesluokkamme sekä ruotsalaisen rannikkoasutuksen välillä on
vain joko eräiden lämminsydämisten, tosiasioita tajuamattomien
haaveksijoiden tai joidenkin oveluuttaan rikkiviisaiden, tosiasioita
tahallisesti vääristävien poliittisten laskijoiden
kestämätöntä, keinotekoista kudelmaa.

Ruotsinkielisellä sivistyneistöllämme kokonaisuudessaan ei ole
mitään olennaista, elimellistä yhteyttä erikoisesti ruotsalaisen
rannikkoasutuksen kanssa: ei ole alkuperän eikä elämäntyön
yhteyttä, ei ole historiallisen yhteis- ja sivistysperinnön eikä
yhteiskunnallisen rakennustyön yhteyttä. Ruotsinkielinen
sivistyneistömme on--kielestään huolimatta--suomalaisen
kokonaisuuden historiallisen kehityksen tulos ja elin, suomalaisen
kokonaisuuden, johon ruotsalaisen rannikkoasutuksen sekä osuus että
vaikutus on vain pieni murto-osa, ja tämän saman suomalaisen
kokonaisuuden sekä keskuudessa että kehkenemiseksi on sen
suoritettava ja suorittaa se tahtomattaankin elämäntyönsä. Vai
mitä yhteyttä on jollakin kuopiolaisella, viipurilaisella, vaikkapa
helsinkiläisellä ja turkulaisella--useinkin suomalaiselta
sydänmaalta polveutuvalla--vanhalla virkamies- tai liikemiessuvulla
erikoisesti ruotsalaisen rannikkoasutuksen kanssa? Korkeintaan ovat he
rakentaneet kesähuvilansa jonnekin saaristosalmen kalteelle ja
huvipurtensa kannelta saaneet jonkin näkemyksen meren nuoleksimista
rantakallioista ja ulkokivistä--»kobbar och skär» onkin
viimeaikaisen ruotsalaisen heräämyksen tunnusmerkillisimpiä isku- ja
mielisanoja--mutta mitään elimellisempää liittymistä
ruotsalaiseen rannikkokansaan ei tällainen lomapäivien joutilaisuus
luo.

       *       *       *       *       *

Suomalaisen kokonaisuuden tarpeiden mukaisesti on kaikkien
keskusvirastojen, keskeisten sivistyslaitosten, yhteiskunnallisen ja
lainsäädännöllisen kehitystyöskentelyn sovitettava työnsä ja
toimintansa, jotta ne täyttäisivät tehtävänsä. Suomalaisen
kansan keskuudessa, suomalaisissa viroissa suorittavat enimmät
virkamiehet elämäntehtävänsä. Ruotsinkielisellä
tiedemiehellä--mikäli hänen työllänsä on kansallista pohjaa ja
yhteiskunnallista taustaa--on tämä pohja ja tausta suomalainen;
ruotsinkielisellä estetiikolla--mikäli hänellä elävän elämän
tajua on-- --tämä taju virrannut häneen kosketuksesta on miten
etäisestä ja itsetiedottomasta hyvänsä-- suomalaiseen elämään;
ruotsinkielinen politiikko--mikäli hänellä on yhteiskunnallista
laajakatseisuutta, yhteiskunnallisen kehityksen tervettä, kypsää
näkemystä--on varttunut tähän laajakatseisuuteen, tähän
näkemykseen suomalaisen yhteiskunnan kasvattamana, suomalaisen
yhteiskunnan sekä saavutuksien että vajanaisuuksien opastamana ja
kannustamana. Suomalainen kansa ja suomalaiset olosuhteet ovat se
pohja, johon jokaisen suurisuuntaisemman teollisuusyrityksen on
tutustuttava ja perustauduttava, jotta tuloslaskelmat voivat rakentua
tosiasiallisten olosuhteitten perustalle ja jotta yrityksillä olisi
riittävä toiminta-ala laajetakseen ja vaurastuakseen. Suomalainen
ahertava työ, Suomen kansan tuhansia tiehykkeitä myöten keräämä
ja luoma aineellinen vauraus muodostaa sen varallisuuden pohjaveden,
jonka hetteille ruotsinkielisen liikemiehenkin on tunteutuminen
loihtiakseen itselleen ne omaisuudet, joiden varassa etupäässä
ruotsinkielinen sivistyneistömme on pysynyt ja pysyy
valta-asemassaan; niistä lähteistä ovat etupäässä heruneet nekin
pääomat, jotka lahjoituksina virtailevat »ruotsalaiseen
kultuurirahastoon»--tuohon Kiinan-muuriin, jonka tehtävä on
ikuisiksi ajoiksi edes keinotekoisesti ylläpitää Suomen
sivistyneistön nykyistä kielellistä kahtiajakoa ja vakiinnuttaa
ruotsinkielisen sivistyneistömme täydellinen ja lopullinen
eristäytyminen Suomen kansasta.

Mitä hyvänsä työtä tässä maassa yleensä tehdäänkin,
henkistä tai aineellista, tapahtuu tämä työ suomalaisessa
aineksessa, suoritetaan se suomalaisessa ympäristössä ja näkyvät
sen jäljet ja hedelmät suomalaisessa yhteishengessä. Tahtoen tai
tahtomattaan on ruotsinkielinen sivistyneistömme määräävältä
enemmistöltään asemansa ja työalojensa vuoksi suomalaisen
yhteiskunnan osa ja elin, ja minkä se työtä tekee, sen se tekee
suomalaisessa yhteiskunnassa ja suomalaisen yhteishengen
palveluksessa, minkä sillä elämän kosketusta ja kokemusta on, sen
se on saavuttanut ja siihen se on kasvanut suomalaisessa
yhteiselämässä, ja minkä se on valmis ja terävä hengen teon ase,
sen se on taottu, karaistu ja hiottu suomalaisessa ja suomalaisella
elämän kamppauksella. Suomalaiseen yhteiskuntaan sitoo sitä ainoa
kestävä yhteiskunnallisen elämän side: suoritettu ja suoritettava
yhteinen työ. Erikoisesti ja rajoitetusti ruotsinkieliseen
rannikkoasutukseen ei sillä ole mitään elävää työn liitettä,
ja jos se yhteiskunnallisesti ja kansallisesti todella rajoittuisi
ainoastaan tähän asutukseen, typistäisi se samalla ehdoin tahdoin
koko henkisen ja aineellisen toimialansa: virkamiehiltä katoaisivat
virat, politiikoilta yhteiskunnallinen rakennustehtävä,
tiedemiehiltä ja luovalta taiteelta yhteiskunnallisen kokonaisuuden
ravitseva, elinaineksia henkivä ilmakehä, liike- ja
käytännön-miehiltä koko toiminta-ala. Yleensä merkitsisi se
kireään johdonmukaisuuteen vietynä nykyisen ruotsinkielisen
sivistyneistömme kieltäytymistä koko sen tähänastisesta
elämänasemasta ja elämäntehtävästä. Sitäpaitsi on ruotsalainen
kansa-asutus maassamme ehdottomasti liika niukka ja heikko mitenkään
edellyttääkseen, kannattaakseen ja antaakseen olemassa-olon oikeuden
niin runsaalle ja vaikutusvaltaiselle yläluokalle kuin nykyinen
ruotsiapuhuva sivistyneistömme on. Jos siis tämä yläluokka pyrkii
perustamaan olemassa-olon oikeutensa ja vaikutusvaltansa tässä
maassa tähän kansa-asutukseen, on sen siinä tapauksessa kaiken
järjen ja kohtuuden nimessä vapaaehtoisesti supistettava asemansa
varsin vaatimattomaksi Suomen kansan yhteiselämässä.

Suomen ruotsinkielinen sivistyneistö _on_ suomalaista ja suomalaisena
se on pysyväkin, ellei kansallissiveellisistä velvoitussyistä, niin
jo pelkästään yksilöllis-itsekkäistä etusyistäkin. Ennemmin tai
myöhemmin on tälle luokalle selkenevä, mihin uskomattomaan sekä
elämäntehtävän että elämänaseman itsekieltoon se on ollut
suistumassa katkoessaan elinjuuriaan siihen kansaan ja yhteiskuntaan,
jonka varassa ainoastaan se kuitenkin on, mitä se on. Tältä
luonnolliselta maaperältään se ei voi irroitella elinjuuriaan
samalla itse jäytämättä ja kalvamatta elämän pohjaa itsensä
alta.

Oman erikoisen selvittelynsä kaipaa »ruotsalainen maa», joka viime
aikoina on virittänyt niin paljon kiihkoilua ja niin monta
silmitöntä ajojahtia nimiltämainittuja yksityishenkilöitä
vastaan. Kukapa ei tunnustaisi oikeaksi sitä tunnetta, joka on
tämän ärtymyksen pohjana. On katkerata elää olojen
murroskaudessa, jolloin vanha totuttu elämänympäristö särkyy
liitteistään ja vaihtuu uudeksi. Mutta on huomattava, että tämä
murroskausi ei ole mikään paikallisesti ruotsalaiseen
rannikkoasutukseen rajoittuva yhteiskunnallinen ilmiö. Myöskin
suomenkielisissä rannikkoseuduissa on käymässä aivan sama
murrosvaihe: alkuperäinen pohja-asutus on kummassakin huuhtoutumassa
uudeksi.

Yleensä tapahtuu maassamme väestövirtailua sisämaasta rannikkoa
kohden. Varttuneempi nuoripolvi joutuu rantaseuduilla melkein
kauttaaltaan siirtolaisuuden tai meriliikkeen lumoihin, ja heidän
tilalleen imeytyy välttämätön työvoima sisempää maasta. Niinpä
on palkkatyöväki tällaisilla seuduilla aivan säännöllisesti
muualta siirtyneitä tulokkaita, ja mikäli maatkin siirtyvät uusiin
käsiin, ovat ostajat niinikään tavallisesti syvempää sisämaasta
tulleita.

Tällainen uusi, liikkeelle joutunut, totutusta ympäristöstään
irtautunut aines on säännöllisesti jotenkin
häikäilemättömämpää, siveellisesti karkeampaa ja
välinpitämättömämpää kuin omassa ympäristössään pysynyt
alkuperäinen asutus. Sitä eivät sido mitkään traditsionit,
tottumukset ja perinnäiskunnioitus entiseen, paikkakunnaaseen
olotilaan; sillä ei ole mitään inhimillistävää ja hillitsevää
tunneliitekohtaa uuteen ympäristöönsä. Maanomistajina ovat heidän
joukossaan näkyisimpänä vaikkei suinkaan yksinomaisena tyyppinä
häikäilemättömät keinottelijat, jotka tulokkaan
välinpitämättömyydellä ja kylmäverisyydellä muuttavat haltuunsa
saamat maa-alueet suorinta tietä rahaksi: raiskaavat metsät ja
silpovat maat, ja tuovat kintereillään vieraan palstanostaja-lauman;
työmiehinä taas on näiden tulokkaiden joukossa kelvollisen
työväen ohella paljon löysää väkeä: kulkurielämän kasvattamaa
kuritonta, siteetöntä, välinpitämätöntä ainesta.

Kaikkiallakin katsoo siis lämmin kotiseudun jäsen tapojen, olojen ja
elämänsävynystävä mielihaikeudella entisen olotilan murtumista,
silminnähtävää turmeltumista ja raaistumista. Ruotsinkielisellä
asuntoseudulla tietysti tehostaa tätä katkeroitumista se
lisä-ärsytin, että tulokkaat, jotka aiheuttavat tämän muutoksen,
sattuvat lisäksi olemaan vieraskielisiä, ja että erikielisyyden
vastakohta siis vielä joutuu kärjistämään eroa tulokkaiden ja
alkuperäisen, vakinaisen asutuksen välillä.

Kysymys ei siis ole kansallinen, vaan yhteiskunnallis-taloudellinen,
eikä se ole autettavissa kansallisvihaa virittävin kiihoituskeinoin,
vaan perinjuurisella yhteiskunnallisella muokkaustyöllä. Niinkauan
kuin ruotsinkielinen pohja-asutus on siirtolaisuuden--Amerikkaan tai
kaupunkeihin ja tehdasalueille siirtymisen--lumoissa, niin kauan
korvaa »ruotsalainen maa» siten siltä menetyksiin menevät
työnsuorittajat ainoalla mahdollisella, tarjolla olevalla
työvoimalla, suomenkielisellä. Ja niin kauan kuin ruotsinkielinen
herrassäätyinen tai talonpoikainen maanomistajaluokka ei ole
elämäntottumuksissaan ja työtavoissaan sovittautunut nykyisten
maahintojen ja työpalkkojen aiheuttamaan ja pakoittamaan
häikäilemättömästi voimaperäiseen ja yksinomaan korkeinta
taloudellista tuottavaisuutta katsovaan maanviljelykseen, niin kauan
on ruotsalaisten ostajain työlästä kilpailla maatilahintojen
korkeudessa suomenkielisten ostajain kanssa ja niin kauan on vaikeata
keinotekoisesti estää maatilojen siirtymistä niihin käsiin, jotka
niistä voivat puristaa enimmät rahat tai muuttaa ne taloudellisesti
tuottoisimmiksi. Ken kiihoistustyön ja siveellisen painon pakottamana
sittenkin alistuu myymään maansa ruotsinkieliselle ostajalle, vaikka
hän vapaassa kaupassa olisi suomenkieliseltä ostajalta saanut siitä
tuntuvastikin enemmän, häntä jää tämä hänen taloudellinen
tappionsa kaivelemaan mieskohtaisesti kärsittynä vääryytenä, ja
ovat tällaiset yleisen mielipiteen terrorismilla saavutetut
»ruotsalaiskansalliset» voitot myöhemmin osoittautuvat
Pyrrhusvoitoiksi. Sitäpaitsi tekee juuri se yleisöpiiri, joka
kiihkoisimmasti kuohuilee jokaista »ruotsalaisen maan kavallusta»
vastaan itse itsensä syypääksi aivan samaiseen
»maankavallukseen». Jokainen vakuutetusti ruotsalainen
kaupunkilainen talonomistaja, liikemies, tehtaanisäntä,
perheenemäntä, joka kahdesta valittavissaan olevasta työnhakijasta
valitsee palvelukseensa ennen suomenkielistä myötäpyrkijää
ruotsinkielisen talonmiehen, vahtimestarin, raitiotiekonduktöörin,
kauppa-apulaisen, päällysmiehen, palvelijattaren, riistää tällä
vaalillaan yhdet terveet käsivarsiparit ruotsalaisen auran kurjelta
ja lähettää niiden sijalle »ruotsalaiselle pellolle»
»suomalaisen myyrän»--kukaties juuri saman miehen, jonka hän
hylkäsi, ja toimii siis tällä teollaan aktiivisena
ruotsalaisseutujen suomalaistuttajana.

Ken ruotsalaisen talonpoikaisen maalaisasutuksen vaarumattomuutta
harrastaa, hän älköön tuhlatko sanaakaan suomalaisia tulokkaita
vastaan: _niiden_ vika ei ole, että he tavoittavat leivän sieltä,
mistä saavat.--Juurrutettakoon sensijaan rannikkoseudun
kansanluonteesta pois tämän rannikkoväestön luontainen taipumus
keveämpään, niin sanoakseni merkantiiliseen työskentelyyn.
Muunnettakoon siinä nykyään vallitseva pyrkimys paeta karkeasta,
raskaasta ruumiillisesta maatyöstä kevyempiin, herrasmaisempiin
elämänehtoihin, muunnettakoon se maahengen elähyttämäksi
kotiturpeen ja kotukonnun rakkaudeksi. Kohdistakoot ruotsalaisen
kotiseudun ja »ruotsalaisen maan» esitaistelijat toimintansa siihen,
että ruotsalainen työntekijä pysyy auransa kurjessa, että
ruotsinkielinen maamies, joka nykyään ammattitaidossaan ja
ammattiharrastuksessaan ehdottomasti on takapajulla suomenkielisen
ammattiveljensä rinnalla, että hän pystyy muokkaamaan maansa sillä
taidolla, tarmolla ja voimaperäisyydellä, jota uudet, muuttuneet
taloudelliset olosuhteet vaativat, niin silloin ei suomenkielisellä
työnhakijalla ole asiaa ruotsinkieliselle asuma-alueelle, eikä
ruotsalaisen talonpojan kannata myydä hänen omissa käsissään
hyötyisää maata vieraalle, olkoon tämä vieras suomenkielinen tai
herrassäätyinen ruotsinkielinen--yhtä turmiollisia tulokkaita
kumpikin ruotsalaisen talonpoikaisasutuksen yhtenäisyydelle. Jos he
tämän voivat vaikuttaa, silloin on ruotsinkielinen kansa-asutus
maassamme vaarumaton, eikä mikään suomalaiskansallinen hyökylaine
johdu suuntautumaankaan heidän asuma-alueelleen: sillä ei silloin
ole siellä mitään tilaa ja tehtävää.

Mutta tätä taloudellisista ja yhteiskunnallisista syistä
aiheutunutta kehitysilmiötä älköön yritettäkö muuttaa toiseksi
tuloksettomalla ja turmiollisella yltiökansallisella
kiihoitustyöllä. Miten katkeraksi, ärtyneeksi ja rotuylpeyden
samentamaksi »itäruotsalaiset» nuoret kaupunkilaisherramme
voivatkin kiihoittaa ruotsalaisen talonpoikaisväestön mielialan
suomalaisia tulokkaita vastaan, se kiihoitustyö on vain mielten
myrkyttämistä, eikä se voi muuttaa hiventäkään niissä
taloudellisissa oloissa, jotka ovat pakoittaneet esiin nykyisen
olotilan. Vasta kun kiihkoilematon, rakentava yhteiskunnallinen työ
ennättää poistaa syyt, joista nykyiset ilmiöt johtuvat,
häviävät seuraukset itsestäänkin.

Niissä olosuhteissa, jotka ruotsalaisella rannikko-asutuksella
vallitsevat, on taistelevan kansallisvihan ja kansallisen
vieroksumisen lietsominen erikielisten kansalaisryhmien välille
lyhytnäköistä ja edesvastuutonta työtä. Se on kuin
mätäsiemenien kylvämistä avoimeen haavaan. Se virittää
ruotsinkielisessä asutuksessa kansallisvihan helposti sytytettävät
tunteet suomenkielisiä tulokkaita vastaan, mutta ei vapauta tätä
asutusta taloudellisesti tarvitsemasta näiden tulokkaiden apua. Se
ärsyttää toisistaan riippuvaisten kansalaisten keskinäisen
suhtautumisen ruttoisan katkeraksi ja aiheuttaa siten kansallisessa
yhteiselämässämme pysyväisen ja aivan tuloksettoman ärtymis- ja
kiihtymistilan: alati märkivän vihan lähteen.

--Pohjaltaan ei ole mitään vastakohtaisuuden ja vieroksumisen
tunnetta suomalaisen ja ruotsalaisen kansa-asutuksen välillä. Olen
itse kasvanut ja saanut ratkaisevat elämänvaikutukseni aivan
kielialueiden yhtymäkohdalla ja tiedän senvuoksi juurilta käsin,
että erikielisten kansa-asutustemme välillä ei ole minkäänlaista
vierovaa tai vihamielistä suhdetta toisiinsa. Erikieliset
väestöryhmät elelevät näissä vaatimattomasti vauraissa
pikkupitäjissä--tarkoitan Turun pohjoista saaristoa--luonnollisessa
ja välittömässä naapuruus- ja useasti sukulaisuussuhteissakin
toistensa kanssa. Kummallakaan taholla ei satu olemaan
herras-säätyistä tilanomistaja- tai virkamiesluokkaa, joka
eriävine elämäntapoineen ja vieraine käsityksineen olisi
hämmentämässä tätä tervettä ja tasa-arvoista suhtautumista eri
kielisten välillä. Mitään kansallisuuskysymystä, joka kohdistuisi
näiden erikielisten asukasryhmien keskinäisiin suhteisiin, ei
siellä ole ollut, ell'ei aivan viime vuosien seminaristi- ja
kansanopistolais-sivistys ja puoluekiihoitus semmoista ole
keinotekoisesti viritellyt.

Sen kyllä tajuan, että kansallisvihan voi minne hyvänsä istuttaa.
On ylen helppoa kiihoittaa ihmiset toisiaan vastaan ja toisiaan
väheksymään. Ihmisessä elää luonnollinen taipumus
laumoittumiseen ja samalla hän on ylen altis yliolkaisesti
halpelemaan sitä, joka sattuu kuulumaan vieraaseen laumaan.
Räätäli halveksuu vilpittömästi suutaria ja suutari yhtä
vilpittömästi räätäliä; uskollinen pitäjäpatriootti ilkkuu
naapuripitäjäläisten erikoisuuksia siinä, missä näiden kieli ja
tavat hieman sattuvat poikkeamaan hänen oman pitäjänsä
mallikielestä ja mallitavoista.--Niinpä uskonkin, että on varsin
helppoa virittää ja lietsoa hereille vihan, vieroksumisen ja
halpelun laumatunteet niin silmiinpistävän erilaisuuden kuin
erikielisyyden perustuksella. Missä siis toisista olosuhteista
lähteneet ja omien kieroutuneiden ennakkoluulojensa näkökulmasta
asioita arvioitsevat, lyhytajatuksiset kiihoittajat ryhtyvät
keinotekoisesti ja johdonmukaisesti kylvämään tällaisia vierauden
ja vihan siemeniä niille niin alttiisiin ihmismieliin, siellä uskon,
että tämä kylvö voi kantaa sadon, jopa yltäkylläisen
sadon.--Mutta kenen aittaa tällainen ohdake-sato on rikastuttava,
sitä en käsitä!

       *       *       *       *       *

Ruotsinkielisen sivistyneistömme on tehtävä vaalinsa! Heidän on
joko käsitettävä itsensä suomalaisiksi: Suomen kansan
historiallisena kehityskautenaan itselleen luomaksi sivistyneistöksi,
sen sivistystyön tulokseksi, kannattajaksi ja tekijäksi; tai on
heidän käsitettävä itsensä ruotsalaisiksi: ruotsalaisen
rannikkoasutuksemme edustajiksi ja hoivaajiksi yhteiskunnassamme.

Jos he ratkaisevat suhtautumisensa oman historiallisen
yhteenkuuluvaisuutensa ja luonnollisen asemansa mukaan ja
käsittävät itsensä suomalaisiksi, on heidän täytettävä
myöskin suomalaisen velvollisuudet: on välittömässä, rakastavassa
työssä elettävä tämän suomalaisen yhteiskunnan elämää,
vaistottava sen tarpeet ja pyrkimykset ja pyhittäydyttävä niiden
toteuttajaksi, myötätunnon välittömyydellä eläydyttävä Suomen
kansan elämyksiin, omistettava henkensä hienous, tahtonsa terä,
sydämensä rakkaus tämän kansan elämänpyrkimysten kehittämiseksi
ja toteuttamiseksi.

Ihminen ei rakasta kansaansa siksi, että tämä kansa olisi jossain
suhteessa erinomainen, erinomaisempi kuin muut kansat, vaan siksi,
että se on hänen kansansa, siksi että hän itse elämässään
toteutuu siinä kansassa, siksi että hänenkin olemisensa on tätä
kansaa. Jokaisen kansan kohdalla on hyve yhtä korkealla, häpeä
yhtä matalalla. Jokaisessa kansassa on kuntoa niin paljon, että se
ansaitsee kunnioituksen ja heikkouksia niin paljon, ettei sillä ole
aihetta mihinkään itsejumaloimiseen; jokaisessa kansassa on
puuttuvaisuutta niin paljon, että se kaipaa jokaisen kansalaisensa
täyden työnteon rakkauden. Jokaisella kansalla ovat omat erikoiset
hyveensä ja vahvat puolensa, ylpeilynsä ja itsetuntonsa aiheet,
jotka ovat kehittyneet juuri sen elämisen ehdoissa ja sen
elintaistelun tuloksina ja jotka siitä syystä saattavat
läheltäkatsojasta tuntua verrattomilta. Jokaisella kansalla on
sitäpaitsi liiaksi ihailtavaa itsessään, ennättääkseen siinä
ohella kiinnittää erikoisempaa huomiota toisten kansojen
mahdollisiin ansioihin--ja saa kansallinen itseihailu kuten muukin
itserakkauden itsesuitsuttelu senvuoksi kaikkialla jäädä
yksinomaisesti asianomisten omaksi huoleksi.

Mikäli kansallinen olemus ja laatu joitakin arvioivia, eetillisiä
atribuutteja ansaitsevat, eivät nämä ole elävälle ja
työtätekevälle kansan jäsenelle mitään peilailevan ylpeilyn,
vaan yhä jännittyvämmän työnponnistuksen aiheita; ne eivät
oikeuta pysähtyvään itseihailuun, vaan velvoittavat ne yhä
syvempään itsekeräymiseen ja voimien kokoomiseen.--Isänmaan
rakkaus ei ole sanoilla palvomista ja ylistelemistä eikä myöskään
oman mieskohtaisen turhamaisuuden mairittelemista ja tympäisevää
ihastelemista oman kansan ja oman rodun kuvitelluissa
erinomaisuuksissa, vaan on se työntekoa omassa yhteiskunnassa ja
välitöntä yhteenkuuluvaisuutta omaan kansaan.

Ja sellaisen työnteon ja yhteenkuuluvaisuuden on taas jokainen
kansalainen velkaa kansalleen. Sellaisen työnteon ja
yhteenkuuluvaisuuden on jokainen ruotsinkielisen sivistyneistömme
jäsenkin velkaa suomalaiselle yhteiskunnalle, mikäli hän tämän
yhteiskunnan jäseneksi itsensä tunnustaa ja mikäli hän sellaisena
toimii ja toimia tahtoo.

--Jos taas ruotsalaisemme valitsevat ruotsalaisuuden, keinotekoisesti
typistävät asemansa vain ruotsalaiseen rannikkoasutukseen
pohjautuvaksi ja kohdistuvaksi, niin on tämäkin valinta tehtävä
kaikkine seurauksineen. Vapaaehtoisesti ja välittömästi on heidän
silloin itse typistettävä tehtäviensä kehä tässä maassa. Suomen
kansaa vieroville ja suomalaisista pyrinnöistä sulkeutuville
ihmisille ei suomalainen yhteiskunta voi uskoa ainoatakaan
elimellisesti tärkeätä tehtävää yhteiskunnallisessa
kehitystyössään. Suomen yliopiston opettajana, suomalaisen tieteen
julistajana, suomalaisen nuorison ohjaajana tiedon lähteille ei voi
hedelmöittävästi toimia henkilö, jolta on sammunut kaikki elävä
myötätunto ja harrastus suomalaista yhteiskuntaa kohtaan, joka
vieroksuu ja kylmii sitä nuorisoa, minkä tiedon tarvetta hänen
olisi holhottava, joka kuvitellun rotu- ja kansallisuus-eron
eristämänä elää ulkopuolella sekä sitä yhteiskuntaa että sitä
nuorisoa, joita ohjaamaan ja herättämään hänen asemansa hänet
velvoittaa. Samaten ei suomalaisen yhteiskunnan palveluksessa voi
hedelmällisesti työskennellä henkilö, joka on sulkeutunut
vieraaksi tämän yhteiskunnan sisäisille tarpeille ja toivomuksille,
jonka mielikuvitusta ei hedelmöitä ja työtarmoa kannusta näiden
tarpeiden ja pyrkimysten myötäelävä tajuaminen.

Sille yhteiskunnalle, jonka palveluksessa tällainen elämän
ympäristöstään erillistynyt ihminen on, on hän
yhteiskunnallisesti kuollut ja hyödytön elin. Hän ei läiky tämän
yhteiskunnan elintahtoa ja -tarpeita, hänen elämänsä ei ole
tämän yhteiskunnan elämäntahdon ja -tarpeen paloa, eikä tämän
yhteiskunnan muodollinen, toiminnallinen ja älyllinen kehittymisen,
järjestäytymisen ja selkeytymisen tarve toteudu hänen
yksilöllisessä elämäntyössään. Mitä tärkeämmällä,
elimellisesti tähdellisemmällä sijalla hän tässä yhteiskunnassa
on, sitä enemmän on jo hänen pelkkä olemassaolonsa tämän
yhteiskunnan elintarpeiden ja elinedellytysten tiellä, sen elintehon
tukahuttajana. Elävän elimen sijasta muodostaa hän kuolleen sulun
elävien, esiintulvivien elämäntarpeiden edessä ja ne hersyvät,
kertyvät voimat, joiden toteuttajana hän vasta olisi toteuttanut
omankin elämänsä, ne paisuvat ja patoutuvat luonnonvoimaisella
välttämättömyydellä hänen suistamisekseen, huuhtoakseen hänet,
tämän hengettömän esteen tieltään. Ken irroittaa itsensä
kansallisesta yhteiselämästä, hän tuomitsee itsensä sekä
itsekohtaiseen että yhteiskuntakohtaiseen hedelmättömyyteen, hän
kuihtuu ja kuolee sekä yksilöllisessä elämänsisällössään
että yhteiskunnan työelimenä.--Ja terveydestään huolehtiva
yhteiskunta hautaa aina kuolleensa.

Jos siis ruotsalaisemme valitsevat kansallisen eristäytymisen Suomen
kansasta, on heidän tehtävä vaalinsa miehisellä selkeydellä ja
tinkimättä alistuttava kaikkiin vaalinsa seuraamuksiin. Heidän on
silloin vapaaehtoisesti myöskin jätettävä Suomen kansan
keskuselimet sellaisten työntekijäin käsiin, jotka niissä
työskentelevät suomalaisina, ja itse rajoituttava vain ruotsalaisen
rannikkoasutuksemme erikoisharrastajiksi ja paikallisiksi
virkailijoiksi.

Ruotsinkielisen yläluokkamme suhtautumisessa
kansallisuuskysymykseemme onkin ärsyttävintä se käsitteiden
hämmennys, jolla he tahtovat kummastakin menettelytavasta omaksua
vain sen tuottamat edut ja heidän itsekkyyttään hyvittävät
puolet. He tahtovat säilyttää kaiken mahdollisen vaikutusvallan
suomalaisessa yhteiskunnassa, mutta kieltäytyvät samalla kaikesta
yhteiselämästä tämän suomalaisen yhteiskunnan kanssa. He tahtovat
vapautua kaikista kansallisista velvollisuuksista, mutta nauttia
kaikkia kansalaisen etuja ja oikeuksia. He tahtovat vapaasti halveksia
Suomen kansaa, mutta yhtä vapaasti elää sen kustannuksella. Kuin
hemmotellut lapset oikuttelevat he eristäytymisharrastuksissaan:
pohtivat vakavissaan, miten peseytyä suomalais-nimityksen tahrasta,
keräilevät huomiinsa rahastoja, järjestelevät puhtaita
yhdistyksiään, rakentelevat esteitä eteenpäin pyrkiville
suomalaisille tiede- ja virkamiehille, varaavat toimet ja paikat
omilleen, pauhaavat tiluskauppojen yhteydessä »ruotsalaisesta
maastaan», pitävät sitä ruotsalaista, joka myy maatilansa
suomalaiselle--_suomalaiselle_ Suomessa!--suorastaan maankavaltajana,
kansalaiskunniansa menettäneenä, mutta nostavat korvia särkevän
hätähuudon, jos suomalaiset tahollaan joutuvat pakoitetuiksi
vetämään käytännölliset johtopäätökset tästä puuhailusta.

Ken välttämättä tahtoo katkaista yhteistunnon ja
elämänvelvoituksen siteet itsensä ja Suomen kansan väliltä, hän
olkoon miehen tavoin myöskin varattu siihen, että elinehdot samalla
myöskin sulkeutuvat häneltä tässä maassa! Ellei joku tahdo olla
suomalainen, niin ei häntä voi siksi pakoittaa, mutta jättäköön
sellainen henkilö silloin myöskin Suomen yliopiston, suomalaisen
viran, Suomen kansan varallisuudesta hyötyvän liiketoiminnan, sillä
hänen käsissään ne tehtävät ovat vieraissa, kuolleissa
käsissä, hänen sydämellään ne ovat vieraalla, kylmällä
sydämellä, joka ei voi tajuta, tunnustaa ja kehittää sitä
työtä, jonka suorittajaksi hän on joutunut. Ken häpeää
nimitystä suomalainen, »finne», hän hävetköön myöskin olla
suomalainen virkamies! Kenen »kunnian»-tunto on niin herkkä, ettei
hän mielentasaisuudella jaksa sietää sitä ajatusta, että
suomalainen talonpoika kerta on tallaava hänen jalorotuisen koiransa
tomua, hänen kunniantuntonsa herkistyköön vielä niinkin pitkälle,
ettei hän käy kuoppaamaan koiriaan suomalaiseen maakamaraan! Ken
pitää suomalaisuutta häpeänään, hän tekee itselleen ja maalle
palveluksen, jos hän ikuisiksi ajoiksi pudistaa jaloistaan sen maan
tomut, jonka kansalaisena hän aina on altis sille
väärinkäsitykselle, että hän on suomalainen. Miehen kunto ja
kunnia vaatii, ettei elä sen kustannuksella, jota halveksii!

       *       *       *       *       *

Itse ruotsalaisuudellekin olisi ruotsinkielisen sivistyneistömme
lämmin ja myötämielinen yhteys suomalaiskansallisen sivistyksen
kanssa, välitön eläminen ja vaikuttaminen sen piirissä suuri
voitto.

Mitä jyrkemmästi ruotsinkielisemme vetävät rajaviivat itsensä ja
kansallisen elämämme välille, mitä vierovampaan eristäytymiseen
he etäytyvät, mitä kylmemmäksi ja ynseämmäksi he ennättävät
suggeroida mielialansa suomalaista yhteiselämää kohtaan, sitä
heikommaksi tulee heidän vaikutuksensa suomalaiseen sivistykseen,
sitä sulkeutuvammin varjelee suomalainen yhteiselämä itseänsä
heiltä ja sitä etäisemmäksi ja vierotummaksi tulee kaikkikin
ruotsalaisuus suomalaiselle sivistyselämälle.

Viime aikoina yhä itsetietoisemmin päätänsä kohottava, uhitteleva
ja pokkuroiva ruotsalainen kiihkonationalismi tekee tässä maassa
mahdollisimman huonon palveluksen itse ruotsalaisuudelle! Ja ken
meidän maassa todellisesti rakastaa ruotsalaisuutta, skandinaavista
sivistystä, ken soisi Suomen suomenkielisenkin sivistyksen säilyvän
läheisimmässä, myötämielisessä ja hedelmällisessä
vuorovaikutuksessa ja kosketuksessa tämän sivistyksen kanssa, saavan
muun europalaisen sivistyskosketuksen ohella siitäkin herätteitä ja
edelleen kehittelevän itsessään sieltä saatuja vaikutuksia, hänen
on vaikeata tasaisin mielin katsoa ja sietää sitä lyhytnäköistä,
vain omaa sokaistua ja itsekästä turhamaisuutta hyvittävää
kiihkoilua, jolla esimerkiksi nykyinen ruotsinmielinen
ylioppilasnuoriso koppavoi luulotellulla ruotsalaisverisyydellään ja
uhittelevalla, tyhjänpäiväisellä junkkariylimielisyydellään
ärsyttää suomalaisen Suomen mielialoja ei yksin itseään--se nyt
olisikin vähäpätöinen seikka--vaan myöskin kaikkea arvokastakin
ruotsalaisuutta vastaan. Jokainen varomaton, joutava ja aiheeton
ruotsalaisuudella kopeilu ja korskailu--varsinkin jos se sitäpaitsi
esitetään solvaisun sivutarkoituksella suomalaisuutta
vastaan--tunnetaan veriin menevänä loukkauksena suomalaisella
taholla, ja palvelee se vain niiden pyrintöjä ja tarkotuksia, jotka
suomalaisellakin taholla yhtä silmittömässä lyhytmielisyydessä ja
tyhjässä kansalliskiihkoilussa työskentelevät kaikkien
ruotsalaisuuden muistojenkin sammuttamiseksi suomalaisesta
sivistyksestä ja joille Viena, Kalevala ja suomalais-ugrilaisuuden
hämy ovat ainoat ainekset, joille suomalais-suomalaisen
»sivistyksen» olisi perustuttava ja jotka tahtovat noutaa
elämänsanat jo vuosituhannet kumpujen yössä lahonneen Vipusen
suusta.

Ruotsinkielinen sivistyneistömme tekisi siis ruotsalaisuudellekin
satoisimman palveluksen, jos se eristäytymisen sijasta pyrkisi
elävimpään, kiinteimpään ja myötätuntoisimpaan yhteyteen
suomalaisen kansallisen sivistyksen kanssa, jos se
elämäntehtäväkseen käsittäisi Suomen suomenkielisen sivistyksen
elävöittämisen sillä hengellä, jota se itse pitää
elinhenkenään. »Taistelevan ruotsalaisuudenkin» tunnussanana ja
pyrintöpäämääränä pitäisi siis olla suomenkielisenkin
sivistyksen läpitunkeminen ja hedelmöittäminen sillä
sivistyksellä ja hengellä, jonka esitaistelijoiksi nämä
»taistelevat ruotsalaiset» itsensä katsovat tässä maassa.

Mutta jo tällainen pelkän ruotsalaisuuden edustajaksi rajoittuminen
on ruotsinkieliselle sivistyneistöllemme ehdoin tahtoista itsensä ja
elämänmerkityksensä typistämistä. Ruotsinkielinen sivistynyt
luokkamme ei ole mikään ruotsalaisuuden edustaja sivistyksessämme,
vaan Suomen kansan europalaiseen yleissivistykseen kohonnut osa ja sen
tehtävänä on olla, ei ruotsalaisuuden kansalliskiihkoisesti
rajoitettuna vaalijana Suomessa, vaan europalaisten hengenvirtausten
herkimpänä välittäjänä suomalaiseen sivistyselämään. Ja
tämän tärkeän ja elimellisen elämäntehtävänsä voi se
suorittaa vain, mikäli se pysyy elävässä, myötätuntoisessa
elämänyhteydessä suomalaisen sivistyksen ja yhteiselämän kanssa.
Ainoastaan siten voi se saavuttaa vaikutusta suomalaisen sivistyksen
muodostamisessa. Eristäytyessään kadottaa se tämän vaikutuksen ja
menettää samalla kaiken luovan kansallisen ja sivistyksellisen
merkityksen ja siis myöskin olemassaolon oikeuden tässä maassa. Se
muuttuu silloin vain provinsielliksi, emämaahan pälyileväksi
siirtokunnaksi, jolla ei ole mitään elämän ja työnteon yhteyttä
ympäristönsä kanssa ja jonka ainoana elämäntehtävänä on
negatiivinen, hedelmätön ja kiivaileva itsepuolustus,
itsepuolustuksen pokkuroiva asenne semmoisessa asemassa, jossa se itse
koko olemisessaan kuitenkin on kokonaisen kansallisuuden elimellisten
kehitysedellytysten tiellä ja jossa sen koko oleminen ja
valta-asemassa säilyminen on tämän kansan henkistä
tukahduttamista. Tällainen surkastunut elämäntehtävä on arvoton
luokalle, jonka kansan historia ja oma yhteiskunnallinen asema oli
varustanut paljon hedelmällisempään, rikkaampaan ja suurempaan
tehtävään.

Ruotsalaistemme omalta kannalta olisi hartaimmin toivottava, että sen
keskuudessa taaskin tapahtuisi suomalaiskansallinen heräämys, että
sille taaskin voisi koittaa sellaisen selkeän näkemyksen ja
kansallisen itselöytämisen päivä, päivä sellainen, jonka
suuressa sarastuksessa Runeberg, Snellman, Cygnaeus, Topelius,
ruotsinkielisen sivistyksemme jaloimmat henget kerta yhtäläisen
pimennon väistyessä rakkautensa terästämällä ja avartamalla
katseella näkivät Suomen kansan kansallisen ja sivistyksellisen
yhtenäisyyden ja loihtivat koko sukupolvensa luovaan ja rikkaaseen
kansalliseen heräämiseen.

       *       *       *       *       *

Tämä kansallinen kaksilohkoistuminen, joka on viimeisien
vuosikymmenien kansallisen historiamme yhä selvemmin esiytyvä
päävirtaus, on aiheuttanut suomenkielisellekin
sivistyksellemme--joskaan ei korvaamatonta elinvammaa kuten
ruotsinkielisen sivistyksemme ennen pitkää on havaittava
kärsineen--niin ainakin sangen vakavan kasvuvaurion. Jos
ruotsinkielinen sivistyneistömme on tässä eristäytymisessä
menettänyt juurensa, niin on suomalaiselta sivistykseltä siinä
mennyt menetyksiin sen kukasto ja hedelmä. Jos ruotsinkielinen
sivistyneistömme on eristäytyessään irroittautunut siitä
maaperästä, josta sen olisi saatava yhäti uusiutuvat
elinnesteensä, niin on suomalainen sivistys ruotsinkielisen
sivistyneistön siitä vierautuessa ja elimellisesti irroittautuessa
menettänyt vuosisataisen historiallisen työn luoman ja kehittämän
henkisen työn elimen: vuosisatoja kootun ja kartutetun
sivistyksellisen ja aineellisen vaurauden ja valmiuden.

Kun yhteisen historiallisen työn luoma sivistyneistö, kansan siihen
astisen kaiken henkisen aikaansaannoksen sekä tulos että kannattaja
korvaamattomana kansallisena menetyksenä ynseästi ja
vierasmielisesti kääntyy omasta kansastansa, unohtaa ja kieltää
oman alkuperänsä ja pohjansa ja sokaistussa, silmittömässä
itseraasimistyössä katkoo kaikki elävät myötäymmärtämisen,
myötätyöskentelemisen ja myötäkamppailemisen suonet itsensä ja
kansansa väliltä, niin silloin ei elävällä kansalla ole muuta
edessä kuin heittää menetetty menetetyksi, alkaa työnsä alusta,
luoda uudessa, kestävässä, kärsivällisessä työssä itselleen
kuoleutuneen elimen sijalle uusi. Kun se kärki, joka oli tahkottu
valmiiksi, jotta kansan henkinen sähkö siinä puhtaimpana ja
tulisimpana ilmiliekkinä palaisi, eristäytyy kosketuksesta kansan
piilevän, elävän sähkövoiman kanssa ja elimistön elimestä
muuttuu elimistön herkimmällä, jaloimmalla kohdalla istuvaksi
vieraaksi paaluksi, joka on särjettävä pois, jotta elimistö taas
voisi terveesti toimia, niin on kansan kestettävä tämä särkemisen
tuska ja palo ja uudessa vuosisataisessa voimain ponnistuksessa
kerättävä ja kehitettävä itsestään ainekset uuden elävän
sivistyselimen luomiseksi.

Ja tämän uuden työn, uudistetun vaivannäön, on Suomen kansa
alkanut, alkanut alusta siinä, missä entisyys petti, missä omat
lapset, oman rinnan nesteillä kasvatetut ja vartutetut ovat
lyhytmielisessä nousukaskopeudessa, alkuperänsä sekä samalla oman
itsensä halveksunnassa unohtaneet ja kieltäneet sen pohjan, jolta
ovat nousseet ja jolta ovat kaikkensa saaneet, alkanut kuten
Saarijärven Paavo uudestaan ja upottaen viljelyksensä syvemmälle
siinä, missä entisen vaivannäön hedelmät korjasi vierauden halla.

Mutta kokonaista kansallista sivistystä ei luoda hetkessä, ei
vuosissa, eikä vuosikymmenissäkään, se tarvitsee vuosisatojen ja
ihmispolvien uupumattoman, perityn ja perinnöksi jätetyn työn
versoakseen täyteläisyyteen ja kypsyyteen. Niinpä onkin orastava
suomenkielinen sivistys ja sivistyneistö vielä kokonaisuutena
katsottuna sivistyksellistä uutisviljelystä ja kantaa se ja tulee
vielä ihmispolvet kantamaan tätä samaa uutisviljelyksen, uuden
raiviomaan epätasaista leimaa. Vielä pilkistää tuolla täällä
silkka korpi sarkojen keskeltä ja maa kokonaisuudessaan on vielä
matalalti viljeltyä, multa karkeata ja murenematonta. Kaikkialla
karahtaa vielä työase kiveen, kaikkialla paatuu maa uppiniskaiseksi
työntekijälle, jokaisella lapion iskemällä, jokaisella auran
kääntämällä tuntee maaperän muokkaamattomuuden.

       *       *       *       *       *

Suomen suomenkielinen sivistys on sekä muodollisesti että
sisäisesti vielä kauttaaltaan kehkenemätöntä. Ken sitä tarkastaa
muodon valmiuden kannalta, saa rajoittaa vaatimuksensa varsin
alkeellisiksi ja yhtä vaatimaton ja vähään tyytyvä saa olla, jos
tunkeutuu tutkimaan tämän nuoren sivistyksen henkistä pätevyyttä
ja sisäistä kypsyyttä. Niin julkisen yhteiselämän kuin
yksityiselämänkin muodon kurissa; niin liike- ja toiminnanelämän
sekä siveellisessä että muodollisessa ryhdissä, asiallisessa
kohdistuvassa täsmällisyydessä kuin yksilöllisessä
itsekurissakin, viljellyssä ja vireässä henkisessä kiinteydessä
ja vaistovarmuudessa; niin jokapäiväisen elämän aistikkaassa
järjestämisessä, arkielämän vähäpätöisissä turhuuksissa kuin
siveellisen tietoisuuden ja hengen tekojen totisella työ- ja
taistotanterella, herkässä sisäisten arvojen tajuamisessa, kaikessa
siinä huomaa sivistysperinnön nuoruuden ja viljelyksen ohuuden.
Tässä, sivistysperinnön lyhytikäisyydessä, muotojen ja
viljelyksen vakiintumattomuudessa onkin se vaurio, jonka suomalainen
kansallinen sivistys on kärsinyt sen ruotsinkielisen sivistyneistön
siitä irtiriistäydyttyä.

Kipeimmästi ja elävimmästi tuntee tämän vaurion se, joka
palavasti suomalaista sivistystä rakastaa ja soisi sen kukoistavan
eheässä voimassa ja kukassa. Muutamat, herkät ja hienot, mutta
lyhytnäköiset henget se hairahduttaa ansaitsemattomaan halpeluunkin:
mikä vain on olosuhteitten aiheuttama ja ajalla ja työllä
korjattava vamma, sen he pikkumaisuudessaan ja pikaisuudessaan
käsittävät laatuvajanaisuudeksi ja kääntyvät hyljeksien ja
kylmenevinä siinä pois, missä päinvastoin juuri tajuttujen
puutteellisuuksien velvoittavimmin pitäisi kutsua heitä ja heidän
hengenlahjojaan palavaan työhön. Oikea isänmaanrakkaus on
samanlaista kuin terve itsekunnioitus: omien virheiden ja
puuttuvaisuuksien selkeätä, lahjomatonta näkemistä, mutta niiden
näkemistä ei itseään halveksiakseen, vaan taistellakseen itsensä
vapaaksi niiden vallasta, teon ja tahdon siveellisellä teräksellä
juurittaakseen ne itsestään pois.

       *       *       *       *       *

Yleensä on nuoren vakiintumattoman sivistyksen tuntomerkkinä
jonkinlainen yksilöllisyyden ylimalkaisuus ja keskeneräisyys. Juuri
tämä yksilöllisyyden kehkenemättömyys on hallitsevana piirteenä
nuoressa suomenkielisessä sivistyksessämme. Se luonnehtii niin
yksityis- kuin julkisenkin elämän muotoja, niin yksilöllistä
elämänsuhtautumista kuin valtiollisen ja yhteiskunnallisen elämän
ilmiöitäkin.

Yksityiselämä on irtautunut vanhan ja vankan talonpoikaiskultuurin
luomista--tosin jäykistä ja umpinaisista, mutta kiinteistä ja
vakiintuneista--muodoista ennättämättä kuitenkaan vielä saavuttaa
riittävää elämänainesta ja veriin mennyttä tottumusta uusiin
elämänsuhteisiinsa. Niinpä on entinen tapojen ja menojen talttunut
tasasuhta ja elämäntottumusten hallittu tyylikkyys vaihtunut
monenmoiseksi kirjavaksi ja epäkypsäksi tavoitteluksi ja
puolivillaiseksi kokeiluksi: vanhat vuosisataisen elämäntottumuksen
luomat ja kypsyttämät muodot ovat joutuneet väistymään uusien,
muuttuneiden olosuhteiden aiheuttamien elämänmuotojen tieltä. Mutta
nämä uudet elämisen muodot ovat kauttaaltaan vielä omistetut vain
ulkopuolisesti, ulkoaopitusti: ne eivät ole oman elämisen, omien
elämäntarpeiden muodostamia ja kehittämiä, vaan ovat ne matkitut,
sulattamattomasti--toisinaan väärin käsitettyinäkin--siirretyt
vieraista elämänsuhteista meidän vakiintumattomiin oloihimme.
Ihmiset eivät ole ikäänkuin kotiutuneet uusiin oloihinsa ja
tapoihinsa ja niinpä kantavat niin asumukset kuin asuminen, niin
pukeuminen kuin käyttäytyminen, niin kodit kuin seurustelu, niin
elämänkäsityksen ryhti kuin sen sisältö ominaista epävalmiuden,
yht'aikaa tavoittelun ja saamattomuuden epäaistikasta ja ikävää
leimaa.


       *       *       *       *       *




JULKINEN YHTEISKUNNALLINEN ELÄMÄ.


Julkinen yhteiskunnallinen elämämme todistaa kauttaaltaan
yksilöllistä kehittymättömyyttä, yksilöllisyyden, yksilöllisten
vaikutinten ja tekijäin tajuamattomuutta, yksilöllisten
voimalähteiden laiminlyömistä. Meillä unohdetaan
yhteiskunnallisessa työskentelyssä helposti yksilöllisyyden
voimapanos.

Mitään pysyvää, arvoa ansaitsevaa työtä ei suoriteta ilman että
ihminen omistaa itsensä tälle työlle; mitä vakavampi, painokkaampi
ja hedelmällisempi hän on, sitä yksinomaisemmin, ehdottomammin ja
kokonaisemmin. Työ tullakseen todellisesti ja tulevaisuuden
hedelmää kantavasti suoritetuksi--ei vain näennäisesti,
tilapäisesti käsistä suorituksi--vaatii tekijänsä kokonaisesti,
vaatii paitsi käsien askareen hengen kehittelevän, keskitetyn,
muovaelevan luomistyön, vaatii paitsi työhetken ponnistuksen
myöskin lepohetken itsekeräymisen, voimiinpatoutumisen, vaatii,
että työhön on antauduttava koko olennolla, hengen ja ruumiin
väellä, ei yksin tilapäisen istumisen sorminäppäränä
askarteluna, vaatii koko hedelmällisen ihmisen. Vain yksilöllinen
työantaumus ja voimanponnistus voi luoda elämästä esiin jotain
alkuperäistä, vain yksilöllinen alotetarmo, yksilöllinen, itse
työn vaikeuksien ohella kasvava, tästä vaikeudesta hedelmöittyvä
neuvokkuus voi suorittaa vaikeimman, sisäisesti kokonaisen, niin
sanoakseni elimellisen työn.

Vain uskaltava voittaa jotakin elämässä, ja vain yksilöllä on
tämä uskaltamisen rohkeus. Vain yksilöllinen, vaistoonsa luottava
ja uskova näkemys uskaltaa kuolinhyppäyksen tuntemattomaan
noutaakseen sieltä voiton ja tappion uhallakin totuuden tai kauneuden
kangastelevan aarteen. Vain yksilöllä on uskalluksen mahti viskata
ja pingoittaa näkemyksen kaaret yli elämän kuiluisten syvänteiden
ja vaeltaa huipulta huipulle; joukon on vaellettava tasaista taivalta,
polettava taattua, koettua tietä, painauduttava laakson umpeen
uudelle huipulle kohotakseen; ja jos siltä jää moni suistuminen
kokematta, niin jäävät siltä myöskin syrjään ne huiput, joilta
avartuvat siintävät näköalat yli hengen maailmojen, ja jos se voi
laskelmillaan päästä tasaiseen etenemiseen, niin elämän uusia
aarnioita se ei ikinä aukaise; taatun vanhan se voi kokemuksen
perustuksella päätellä arvoisaksi, mutta väkevän uuden se
aavistuksettomana sivuuttaa.

On hengen tuhlausta jos kansa laskee luottamuksensa ryhmille eikä
yksilöille. Ryhmä on vain yhteydetön ja hengetön kasauma toisiinsa
herpoutuneita, toistensa varaan pysähtyneitä yksilöitä; yksilö
taas on elävä, elimellinen kokonaisuus, johon on patoutunut teon ja
tulevaisuuden, alkuperäisen alotteen itsenäisyys ja mahti. Missä
teon alote, suunnittelun rohkeus ja valppaus, toteuttamisen tarmo ja
johdonmukaisuus on siirretty yksilöltä ryhmälle, siellä on
katkaistu kärki eteenpäin viiltävältä teolta, painettu maahan
suunnittelun hurmattu, itsenäinen lento, laimennettu ja hämmennetty
toteuttamisen kestävä, huumatussa itsensä unohduksessa tuloksiin
suistuva ponnistus; siellä viihtyy vain keskinkertaisuus,
keskinkertaisuus niin teossa kuin suunnittelussa, niin alotteessa kuin
toteuttamisessa; siellä on yhteisö eksynyt jokaisen pyrkimyksensä
ainoasta toteuttajasta, yksilöstä; siellä on miekalta kadonnut
terä, silmältä näkö, työn suoritukselta suorittaja.




KOMITEATYÖ.


Meillä Suomessa, eritoten suomenkielisissä sivistyspiireissä ja
suomenkielisessä julkisessa toiminnassa esiytyy tämä
yksilöllisyyden tajuamattomuus, yksilöllisen voimatehon
laiminlyöminen ja syrjäyttäminen aivan hallitsevana ja
sävyttävänä yleispiirteenä. Erittäin kuvaavasti ja ilmekkäästi
osoittautuu se jo yhteiskunnallisen työskentelymme tavallisimmissa
muodoissakin.

Yhteiskunnallisessa järjestelyssä ja rakennustyössä on meillä
erikoistaipumuksena uskoa sekä alote, työ että edesvastuu
joukkotoiminnalle: komiteoille, johtokunnille, valiokunnille,
lautakunnille, hallintoneuvostoille--millä nimityksellä
kulkenevatkin. Arvellaan, että missä ei itsestään ole keksintö
kirvonnut, siellä kirpoaa se jonkinmoisena aivojen yhteistoiminnan
tuloksena, että missä tuntuu yksilöllistä alotetta, yksilöllistä
näkemystä, yksilöllistä järjestelykykyä puuttuvan, siellä
asetetaan joukko kokeneita miehiä kiskomaan toisistaan esiin tätä
alotetta, tätä näkemystä, tätä järjestämisen tarmoa. Jos
milloin ja missä huomataan jonkin seikan olevan takapajulla tai
muuten vinossa, asetetaan komitea pohtimaan, missä se takapajuisuus
oikein piilee ja mitä pajunköyttä sen korjaamiseksi on punottava.
Jos mitä uutta tuntuu tarpeelliselta muovata, turvaudutaan taaskin
samaan patenttikeinoon: asetetaan taaskin komitea tasapäisiä miehiä
pohtimaan ja jauhamaan, mikä tämä uusi oikeastaan olisi ja miten
sen toteuttamiseen olisi ryhdyttävä.--Tässä menetellään yhtä
nerokkaasti kuin teki entinen puumies, jolla oli kolme tylsää
kirvestä ja joka saadakseen muka veistävämmän työaseen sitoi
kirveensä yhteen.

--Tämän komiteataikauskon rinnalla ja sen edellytyksenä on meillä
vallitsemassa eräs toinenkin taikausko: »hyväpäisyyden»
taikausko. Sen lumoissa ovat yhteistoiminnalliset käsityksemme. Sekin
johtaa osaltaan meillä vallitsevaan yksilöllisesti höllään ja
harhailevaan työalan valintaan, hataraan ja pintapuoliseen
tehtävälle omistaumiseen, näennäiseen työnsuoritukseen ja
mieskohtaisen työtarmon pirstoamiseen.

Jos ken osoittautuu sujuvaksi, näppäräksi työntekijäksi, niin
sanotuksi »hyväpäisiksi» mieheksi, niin luullaan sillä meillä
kaiken autuuden täytetyksi. Tällaiselle, lahjakasilmeiselle
henkilölle ovat meillä kaikki portit myötäsukaan avoimina. Hänen
kaltaiselleen tyrkytetään--varsinkin jos hän lisäksi on »mukava»
ja mukautuva mies tai kuuluu »piireihin»--jos mitä virkatoimia ja
luottamustehtäviä, muovataan väkivoimin hänestä sellainen
komiteajuoksija, joka meillä juuri on ominainen yhteiskunnallinen
toimi- ja luottamushenkilö. Tällaisen, enemmän lahjakkaan eleen
kuin todellisen lahjakkuuden lumoissa unohdetaan omistaa huomiota ja
antaa niille tuleva arvo muille oleellisemmille ja elämäntyössä
painavammille ja ratkaisevammille luonteen ominaisuuksille.

Tällainen »hyväpäinen» lahjakkuus on nimittäin usein sangen
näennäistä ja pintapuolista. Se on tavallisimmasti vain kevyttä,
ulkopuolista sopeutumista kulloiseenkin työhön, ei tunkeutumista
tehtävän sisäiseen laatuun ja ytimeen; se on vain tilapäistä
hetken vaatimusten käsistä suorimista, ei pysyvän teon
vaivanalaista mutta hedelmällistä esille kehittämistä; se on usein
vain pinnallisen ihmisen suulasta touhuilemista ja sanavalmista tiedon
ja taidon näyttelemistä, joka hämmentää sanatulvaan asiallisen
tietämättömyyden ja tartuntaherpouden.

Ihmistyössä on taitavuus vain luonteellisen alkuperäisyyden ja
voiman ase ja palvelija. Vasta luonteen itsevoimainen kiinteys ja
paino, luonteen antaumiskyky, työuskollisuus ja sisäisen
omistautumisen mahti voi taidon vipusimella järkyttää vastahakoiset
ja ihmiskäsittelyltä livahtavat elämänilmiöt ihmistahdon ja
-tarpeiden mukaiseen järjestykseen. Pelkkä taitavuus ilman luonteen
painoa liuskahtaa muodostettavan elämän ohitse yhtä hervottomasti,
jälkeä jättämättömästi kuin aalto rantakallion ohitse:
peittää vain hetkelliseen haihtuvaan hyrskevaippaan hyökynsä
tuloksettomuuden ja rientää näennäisestä suorituksesta uuteen
yhtä näennäiseen.

       *       *       *       *       *

Meillä, missä siis niin hartaan naivisti uskotaan johtokuntiin ja
komiteoihin--varsinkin jos niihin kuuluu tohtoreita ja neuvoksia--ja
missä yhtä naivisti ja sovinnaisesti uskotaan mihinkä hyvänsä
liukkaaseen, tuhatnäppärään hyväpääniekkaan, meillä on
sääntönä kaiken terveen, keskitetyn ja kohdistetun työtarmon
pirstonta. Meillä sälyyttää yleinen luottamus samalle
henkilölle--ja sälyyttää jo asianomainen itsekin itselleen--jos
mitä työn rihkamaa. Samainen yhteiskunnan pylväs istuu meillä
tavallisesti vakinaisena tai v.t:nä yht'aikaa puolessa kymmenessä
virassa ja kymmenessä komiteassa: opettaa tunnin parin jossakin
koulussa, hoitaa dosentuuriaan yliopistossa, näpertelee siinä ohella
tiedeaskareitaan, istuu tuntisirpaleensa jonkin aikakauslehden
toimituksessa, jossakin taidelautakunnassa ja teatterijohtokunnassa,
rientää sieltä juoksujalkaa jonkin aatteellisen valistustoimikunnan
kokoukseen, kuuluu sitäpaitsi vakaisena johtokunnan jäsenenä yhteen
tai useampaan liikeyritykseen, suunnittelee jossakin valtion
valiokunnassa vuosikausia jonkin yhteiskunnallisen toimialan
umpimähkäistä parantamista ja uusimista, pudistaa lisäksi
hihansuustaan artikkeleja ja arvosteluja sanomalehtiin ja
aikakauskirjoihin, mistä ainesta kulloinkin vain on kysyntää,
tekaisee siinä sivussa vaikkapa pitkän romaaninkin ja sujahuttaa
suomennostyön, hosuu yleensä tässä juoksemisessa ja istumisessa
niin päällään kuin kynälläänkin, niin käsillään kuin
takinliepeilläänkin senkin seitsemälle taholle ja tolalle.--Koko
tämmöinen tuoksina on joko todellisen työnteon täydellistä
tajuamattomuutta ja kykenemättömyyttä tai sitte todellisenkin
mieskohtaisen työtarmon--jos sitä on sattunut pohjalla
olemaan--kevytmielistä tuhlaamista ja pirstoamista.

Meidän yhteiset asiamme hoitavat ja järjestävät nyt tällaiset
taidon ja tiedon sirpaleet, harrastuksen ja huomion murto osaset,
kymmenes-osaiset ihmistahdon siruset, joiden kokemus ja tarmo
toisillaan kerrottuinakin antavat--kuten murtoluvut ainakin--vain yhä
pienenevän murtoluvun, 1/100 ja 1/1000 osasen tahtoa, alotevoimaa,
järjestämisen kiinteyttä ja päämääräselvyyttä.--Tällaiset
voimat sepittävät lakimme, tällaiset johtavat puolueemme, ohjaavat
liikkeemme ja liike-elämämme, järjestävät yhteiskunnallisen
työskentelymme, johtavat sivistyslaitoksemme ja henkiset
herätysliikkeemme, värittävät ja vesistävät sanomalehtemme,
toimittavat kultuuriaikakauskirjamme, »taiteellistavat» teatterimme.

Nämä yhteiskunnallisen järjestämistyön elintehtävät suoritetaan
päällepäätteeksi tilapäisissä, iltaisissa tai
sunnuntai-aamupäiväisissä joukkoistunnoissa, joihin tavallisesti
saavutaan aivan valmistaumattomina tai ainakin varsin puolinaisesti ja
hätimiten kokoonkyhätyillä ennakkotiedoilla varustettuina, pää ja
mielikuvitus vielä kuumina tälle istunnolle täysin vieraista
asioista. Silloin kysytään kylmäverisyyttä ja »hyväpäistä»
näppäryyttä, jotta tällaisissakin olosuhteissa kuitenkin voi
yht'äkkiä kyhätä ja improvisoida itselleen mielipiteeltä
näyttävän hätävarakäsityksen kulloinkin esille sattuvasta
kysymyksestä. Ainekset tällaiseen mielipidekyhäelämän antaa yhtä
luontevasti--jopa luontevamminkin--minkä hyvänsä komiteavirkaveljen
vuolas ja suulaava sanavalmius--miten asiallisesti hatara ja
perustelematon hyvänsä--kuin jonkun toisen sattumalta asiaan
perehtyneenkin jäsenen pätevämpi, mutta sanonnallisesta avuttomampi
ja kankeampi esitys. Joka tapauksessa tällainen tilapäisesti
tekaistu käsitys, vaikka se onnen kaupalla olisi sattunut solahtamaan
oikealle tolallekin, on mieskohtaisesti aivan tiivistämätön,
pintapuolinen ja vakaantumaton. Tällaisille aineksille rakentuva
yhteispäätös taas on aina aivan sattumanvarainen ja voi yhtä
helposti luontua löyhäksi kuin päteväksikin.

Kun sitäpaitsi on otettava huomioon, että milloin tahdot ja
käsitykset käyvät ristiin, useamman henkilön yhteisharkinnan
tulokseksi täytyy muodostua välitysehdotus, josta on katkottu
kärjet ja tutkaimet niin hyvään kuin huonoonkin suuntaan ja josta
ilmeisten, jokaisen näkyviin lankeavain erehdysten ja vajanaisuuksien
ohella on siloitettu pois uutta kehitystä lupaavat arimmat
silmukatkin ja tulevaisuuden taimet, niin käsittää, että komitea- ja
johtokuntatyö voi vaalia ainoastaan keskinkertaisuutta niin
ihmisissä kuin asioissa, sellaista, johon ei kompastu hyvässä eikä
huonossa merkityksessä tasainen järki, että vieras hyvä on niille
yhtä epäilyttävä ja vältettävä kuin ilmeisesti heikkokin, ja
että ratkaisevissa käänteissä ja uusia uria auottaessa jäävät
rohkeat, uskaltavat ja perille vievät alotteet suorittamatta.

Juuri tästä komitea- ja johtokunta-omaisesta yhteistyöskentelystä,
sen välttämättömästä, luonteettomasta keskinkertaisuudesta
johtuukin se ominainen liukuva ylimalkaisuus ja asiallinen
epäpätevyys, joka usein leimaa erikoisesti suomenkielisiä--eritoten
helsinkiläisiä--yhteiskunnallisia johtopiirejä, se toimittelias
kykeneväisyyden ilme yksilöllisen ja luonteellisen
tyhjänpäiväisyyden ja puolikelpoisuuden rinnalla, se lavertelias
periaatteileminen silloin kun olisi annettava sanojen vaahdon sijasta
yksinkertainen, itse puolestaan puhuva teko. Kaikessa julkisessa
työskentelyssä, kaikessa keskeisessä luottamustyössä
uiskentelevat meillä kermana kaikenlaatuiset pauhun, kohinan ja
näön, suulaan, mutta epäpätöisen ja epäasiallisen sanavalmiuden
miehet, komiteapakisijat. Kansan luontainen kelpoisuuden vaisto on
äkillisissä uusissa olosuhteissa niin hämmentynyt tai vakaantumaton
vielä, että kaikellainen sivelty näkökulta häikäisee sen
näkemästä luottamusmiestensä todellista luonteen painoa ja arvoa
ja että se luottamuksellaan valtuuttaa usein sangen köykäisiä
henkilöitä.




PUOLUE-ELÄMÄ JA SANOMALEHDISTÖ.


Puolue-elämämme on tällaisen luonteettoman, yksilöllisesti
epäitsenäisen ja epäalkuperäisen, kanslianomaisen johdon vuoksi
luiskahtanut umpikujaan. Porvarilliset pääpuolueemme kilpailevat ja
kinastelevat täysissä tosissaan siitä, kumpi niistä on
vapaamielisiä uudistuksia harrastavampi, kumpi tervettä vanhaa
kehitystä säilyttävämpi, kumpi on kansallisempi,
perustuslaillisempi, kumpi ajaa tarmokkaammin raittiutta,
torppariasiaa, maalaiskansan etuja, työväenolojen parantamista,
nuorisoseura-aatetta, yhteistoimintaa, kumpi osoittaa suurempaa
kunnioitusta kirkolle ja kumpi on uskon asioissa vapaa-aatteisempi.
Tämä osoittaa vain, kuinka tyhjät, laimeat sydämet ja ontot,
juurettomat tahdot ovat näiden puolueiden keskeisenä ytimenä.
Puolueiden keskeisiltä henkilöiltä puuttuu alkuperäisen,
asiallisen näkemyksen mahti tajutakseen uusien olosuhteitten
asettamat ja viitoittamat uudet tehtävät ja uudet vaatimukset:
puuttuu se luonteen suorakasvuisuus ja itsenäisyys, joka väkevällä
kädellä pakoittaisi rintamat asettumaan siihen tanaan, jota nämä
uudet olosuhteet vaativat.

Luonnollinen puolue-elämä on yhteisten asioiden, yhteisen
käsityksen perille ajamista ja toteutumiseen taistelemista. Siellä
missä päämäärä ja tarkoitusperät ovat yhteiset, siellä on
myöskin luonnollisesti taisteltava yhdessä, rinnan: siellä lyö
selvä, luja ja alkuperäinen tahto sillat entisten erimielisyyksien
ja lohkoumisten ylitse ja lykäten menneen menneeksi taistelee
nykyhetken yhteisen pyrintöperän luomalla yksimielisyydellä. Vain
siellä, missä puuttuu päämäärää luova luonteen mahti, missä
asiallinen näkemys ei ole niin alkuperäinen ja väkevä, että se
välittömästi heittää samaan pyrkivät tahdot yhteiseen
ponnistukseen, vain siellä saattavat vanhat heroittuneet kinat vielä
kummitella mielissä ja entisyyden varjot hämmentää nykyisen hetken
ja nykyisen tilanteen vaatimaa rintamaa.--Puolue ei ole mikään
kivettymä, joka pysyy kerta muodostuttuaan, vaan on se sen takana ja
sitä kannattavain pyrkimysten ja voimien patouma, aallon paisumus,
joka kasvaa ja heikkenee sen mukaan, kuinka elävä, suorassa
suunnassa kulkeva ja laajalti paisuva on sitä ajava pyrkimys.

Nykyisten puoluemiesten, nykyisen puoluejohdon henkistä pienuutta,
hedelmättömyyttä ja alotekyvyn laimeutta osoittaa se, että
puolueemme vielä liukuvat entisillä teloillaan, vaikka yleinen
mielipide jo on aikoja sitte täysin kypsä uusiin, nykyisten
tarpeiden ja vaatimusten mukaisempiin ryhmityksiin. Nykyiset
puolueemme ovat oikeastaan enää vain entisten tarpeiden
jähmettymiä, sisällön jättämiä kuoria, joiden varjossa vielä
vanhasta tottumuksesta ollaan, mutta joilla ei enää ole mitään
lämmittävää, yhteen liittävää, taisteluun johtavaa mahtia.

Viimeiset--vuoden 1916--eduskuntavaalit, joissa sosialistit
saavuttivat ehdottoman enemmistön eduskunnassa, tuntui
hämmästyttäneen puoluepiirejämme. Tulos oli kuitenkin
luonnollinen, koska sosialistit tällä hetkellä muodostavat ainoan
poliittisen puolueemme, jota yhdistää ja innoittaa yhteisen
pyrkimyksen päämäärä. Annettakoon porvaripuolueillekin asia,
jonka kaikki mielet välittömästi tuntevat yhteiseksi ja omakseen,
annettakoon niille selvittävä ja kokoova taisto- ja iskusana, jossa
on tavoitettu mielissä kytevä yleinen pyrkimys, ja enemmättä,
keinotekoisetta kiihoitustyöttä ovat rivit ryhmittyvät ja
taajenevat ja lähtevät liikkeelle ja yhteisen joukkohuumauksen
hurmassa riuhtaisevat mukaansa välinpitämättömätkin.

Jos esimerkiksi näissä vaaleissa suomalaiset porvaripuolueet
olisivat kulkeneet yhdessä yhteisin tunnuslausein ja yhteisin
rintamin kuten niillä on yhteinen mielikin ja kuten kaikki muut,
paitsi muutamat piintyneet puoluepukarit, pitivät luonnollisena, niin
olisi tämän yhteisen liikunnon vuolas luonnollinen pyörre ollut
mahtavin ja tehoisin äänestykseen kiihoitin. Mutta mistä olisivat
meidän paatuneet puoluekanslistimme ja virastoiksi jähmettyneet
puolueneuvostomme oppineet tajuamaan tällaista joukkoliikuntojen
tenhoa ja vyöryttävää mahtia, ja ottamaan ovelissa, rikkiviisaissa
vaaliteknillisissä laskelmissaan huomioon myöskin elävän elämän
virtaukset?

       *       *       *       *       *

Sama terävien, hallitsevien, alotevoimaisten yksilöiden puute, mikä
tekee puolue-elämämme niin seisahtaneeksi ja asiallisesti hataraksi,
sama puute laimentaa ja ylimalkaistaa julkista sanaammekin.

Maaseudun lehdet ovat olosuhteiden vuoksi yleisemmästi
merkitsemättömiä. Niiden vaikutus ja harrastuspiiri rajoittuu
verrattain vähäiseen ympäristöön, ja ovat toimitusvoimatkin
yleisen yhteiskunnallisen mielipiteen johtajiksi ja suunnanantajiksi
yleensä toisarvoista väkeä. Pääkaupungin johtavat lehdet taas
ovat välittömästi monipäisten ja epäpersoonallisten puoluepiirien
ja -ryhmien välittömän vaikutuksen ja johdon alaisina.

Sillä sijalla, jolta olisi luotava, annettava sisältöä yleiselle
mielipiteelle, hyörivät ja toimivat vain näppärät ja
sujahtelevat, mutta luonteettomat kynäniekat, itsenäistä
näkemystä ja vakaumusta vailla olevat, mutta sitä alttiimmin ja
ehdottomammin ryhmän uskoa vannovat sanasepät. Vain sellaiset
sopeutuvat kätyreiksi ja kirjureiksi puoluevaltuuskunnille, vain
sellaiset taipuvat siloisesti puhumaan valtuuskunnissa siloisiksi
tallatuista asioista; sellaisten sanakehrän pyörimistä ei häiritse
mikään itsenäinen, omavarainen havainto siitä, ett'eivät kaikki
asiat todellisuudessa kuitenkaan ehkä olekaan aivan niin selkeät,
yksinkertaiset, liukkaat ja pykäliin sopeutuvat kuin puoluekokouksen
pöytäkirja tai puolueen vahvistettu ohjelma säätävät.

Toimituskuntien nimellisinä koristuksina saattavat kylläkin komeilla
jotkut tieteellisen tai yhteiskunnallisen toiminnan eturintaman
miehet, mutta työskentelevät nämä silti edelleen varsinaisilla
työaloillaan. Työ, joka itsessään kysyisi väkevimmän ja
hedelmällisimmänkin hengen täyden ja kokonaisen luonteen mahdin ja
luovan keskittyneen työtarmon, on täten joutunut muun varsinaisen
elämäntehtävän ohella tilapäisesti suoritetuksi sivutoimeksi.

Tällaisen järjestyksen jäljet näkyvätkin elävästi
pääkaupungin johtavissa lehdissä. Niissä rehoittaa ilmeisin
keskinkertaisuus, ainoakaan johtava persoonallisuus ei puhu niiden
laimeasta arkisuudesta. Niissä kyhätään ja kyhätään palstat ja
taaskin palstat harmaata, ikuisen harmaata paperia, mutta kärjeksi
terästyvä, salamaksi singahtava, suorana sydämen verenä suihkuava,
naulan kantaan helähtävä johtajansana jää kirpoamatta niiden
sanaerämaasta. Niissä ei ole tilaa yksilöllisesti itsenäiselle ja
uutta luovalle valtiolliselle ja yhteiskunnalliselle näkemykselle.

Jos missä tuntuu paisuvan väkevämpi, itsenäisempi mahti, joka
ainoan riittävän ja pätevän valtuutuksen, oman henkilökohtaisen
vakaumuksen nojalla tahtoisi uudistaa ja asiallisemmille, elävän
elämän mukaisemmille perustuksille siirtää vanhoissa ja
vanhentuneissa uomissa kulkevan puolueryhmityksemme ja jossa on
näkemyksen totuutta ja vakuuttavuutta, julistajan tulta ja hartautta
niin paljon, että hänessä uhkaa nousta yleistä mielipidettä luova
ja muodostava voima, niin sävähtävät kaikki puoluekoneistoissa
hyörivät piskuiset ratassieluset, ja yhteisessä itsehyväisessä
häärinässä suljetaan ja teljetään tämä vaarallinen mies
vaikutuksesta ja pelastetaan puolue hetkeksi--vaikkapa puolueen koko
vastaisen elämän ja kehityksen kustannuksellakin. Onhan
viisaampaa--johtokunta-viisaampaa!--ottaa alaisekseen mies, joka ei
johda, on vain taipuva johdettava; silloin pysyy pääasia kuitenkin
entisellään: johtokunta _johto_kuntana.

Mutta miten viisasta toimitusneuvostojen vallan ja vaikutuksen
säilyttämiseksi onkin miehittää sanomalehtemme--johtavatkin
lehtemme--keskinkertaisuuksilla, on tällainen menettely periaatteeksi
omistettuna kuitenkin kansan hengen tukahuttamista. Yksilöissä,
eheissä tahdoissa, luovan teon miehissä on kansan elävä voima:
niiden sydämen ja pään ahjosta sinkoo kaikki, mikä antaa kansan
tahdolle sisällön ja muodon, suuntaa sen, vie sen saavutuksiin.
Missä persoonallisuus, luova yksilöllinen voima esiytyy on riisto
kansalta, kansan oikeudelta herättäjäänsä, johtajaansa, jos ei
tätä persoonallisuutta lasketa sille paikalle, missä hänen
voimansa voi hedelmöittää kansan. Luova persoonallisuus on
kansallinen voima. On kuolemansynti kansaa vastaan tehdä tehottomaksi
tällainen luova persoonallisuus!

Väkevällä, itsevoimaisella persoonallisuudella, henkisellä ja
luonteellisella kiintotähdellä, jolla on valonsäteilynsä
itsessään ja joka säihkyää valonsa polttavaa rikkautta
ympärilleenkin, hänen kaltaisellaan ei ole tilaa nykyaikaisessa
suomalaisessa hyvin johdetussa sanomalehdessä--enempää kuin
missään muussakaan suomalaisessa yhteisyrityksessä. Sillä mihin
joutuisivat silloin tärkeät toimitusneuvostot ja yhteiskokemuksen
ylenpalttisuutta nuokkuvat johtokunnat, jotka haukottelevat
pitkäpiimäisyyttään ja unisuuden malttiaan kuin hometta jokaiseen
asiaan, jota käsittelevät, ja joiden yhteisharkinnan kiirastulen
lävitse itsenäinen, alkuperäinen ja uutta hedelmöivä ajatus voi
yhtä helposti ja vammautumatta tunkeutua kuin kameeli neulansilmän
lävitse?--Keskinkertaisuus säikähtyy aina tyrmistyneemmäksi
alkuperäisesti hyvän ja väkevän ilmiön edessä kuin ala-arvoisen
ja heikon, sillä oikea itsesäilytysvaisto sanoo sille, että heikko
jää eloon jääneenäkin hedelmättömäksi ja siis vaarattomaksi,
mutta väkevä hyvä saattaa uhata mullistuksella koko olevaa
tilannetta ja suistaa keskinkertaisuuden itsensäkin valta-asemiltaan.

Erittäin kuvaavaa henkiselle ryhdillemme on muuan pienoispiirre, joka
luonnehtii julkista sanaamme. Eräät asiat, laitokset, henkilöt tai
toimenpiteet ovat aina jonkun lehden erikoisen suojeluksen alaisina ja
ovat julkisessa toiminnassaankin pyhitetyt asianomaisen lehden
arvostelevalta suhtautumiselta. Pidetäänpä aivan julkisena
»skandaalina», jos vedetään julkisuuteen jotain tämmöisen,
asianomaisten helmoihin otettujen laitosten tai henkilöiden
heikkouksia--olkoonpa laitos tai ilmiö sivistyksellisesti tai
yhteiskunnallisesti miten tärkeä tahansa ja olkoonpa heikkous tai
harha-askel miten olennainen ja ilmeinen hyvänsä. Tätä
peittelevää jänis-diplomatiaa--pään piiloittamista pensaaseen
muun ruumiin jäädessä miten näkösälle hyvänsä--tätä hurskaan
viatonta toivomusta, että kun heikkouksista ei mitään hiiskuta, ei
niitä silloin olekkaan, sitä harrastetaan ja vaalitaan meillä
vähin joka taholla. Tämä piirre on yhtä tuttu ja koettu jokaiselle
helsinkiläiselle julkiselle arvostelijalle kuin maaseutulehtienkin
avustajille. Kaikkialla saa olla yhtä varautunut siihen, että
jossakin asiassa koskettaa arkaan kohtaan, jolloin arvosteleva
kirjoitus tai huomautus--miten vilpittömässä mielessä se on
tehtykin ja vaikkapa siitä vastaakin omalla nimellään--kuitenkin
joko painetaan villaisella tai hiljaisesti haudataan paperikoriin.




EDUSKUNTAJÄRJESTYS.


Suomen suomenkielisen yhteiskunnallisen luomisen tähän asti tärkein
ja ilmekkäin aikaansaannos, Suomen uusi eduskuntajärjestys valaisee
syntyhistoriassaan ja rakenteessaan mitä elokkaimmin sitä
yksilöllistä viljeltymättömyyttä, jonka katveessa julkinen
elämämme vielä on.

Vain ympäristössä, jossa yksilölinen arvostelu ja itsenäinen,
asiallinen pohdintakyky vielä ovat aivan alkuasteella saattaa
tilapäinen mielialapuuska siten riuhtaista yhteiskunnallisen
kehityssuunnan aivan uusille, oudoille, jopa seikkaileville urille
kuin suurlakon tapahtumat meillä. Vain yleisen mielipiteen
luonteettomuus, viljelemättömyys ja kehittymättömyys selittää
sen, että kokonainen kansa hetkellisessä, sokaistussa hurmiossa
yrittää viskata siihen-astisen historiallisen yhteiskunnallisen
rakenteensa sivulle ja kevytmielisessä, vaistottomassa rohkeudessa
ryhtyy sepittelemään itselleen uutta, tilapäisten parantelijain
sille tyrkyttelemää patenttijärjestystä.

Kuten esi-isäinsä itsetiedottomuuden unesta virvonnut nykyaikainen
talonpoika ensi tietoisuuden työnään turmelee esi-isäinsä
hänelle jättämän kodin: paloittaa seinät ikkunoiksi ja oviksi,
rakentaa julkihuoneet ja verannat, mutta hävittää tuvat, korottaa
katot ja korustaa salit, mutta unohtaa ovien ja ikkunoiden
ylenpalttisuuden välille varata itselleen vuoteen tilan,
vierashuoneittensa sekaan perheen huoneen, koko asuntonsa
tehdasmoiseen suurekkuuteen asuttavuuden ja kodin leiman; samaten on
Suomen valveutunut kansakin luodessaan uuden eduskuntajärjestyksen
unohtanut, että yhteiskuntaa ei järjestetä näöksi ja
näyteltäväksi, vaan elettäväksi, että yhteiskunnallisen luoman
kelpoisuus ei ole siinä, kuinka uusikuosiseksi se on sattunut
luontumaan, vaan siinä, kuinka taipuisasti se soveltuu oleviin
olosuhteisiin ja palvelee elävän elämän tarpeita luoden olevan,
menneisyydeltä perityn yhteiskunnan pohjalle kehittyneitten,
muodostuneitten elämäntarpeiden mukaista uutta.--Eduskunnan autuus
ei ole siinä, kuinka väljille äänioikeuksille se rakentuu, vaan
siinä, miten työkelpoisa elin se on yhteiskunnalle, miten runsaasti
yhteiskunnallisen työskentelyn taitoa, kokemusta ja kypsää,
raitista, uskaltavaa malttavaisuutta se voi pusertaa, kohottaa esiin
kansasta kansan yhteisiä asioita hoitamaan.

Suomen nykyinen eduskuntajärjestys edustaakin erikoisen valaisevasta
nuorta, juurtumatonta yhteiskunnallista sivistystämme. Se on
kauttaaltaan rakennettu, ei missään kohdassaan muodostunut, se on
perustunut aatteille, ei elämälle. Se kantaa kaikessaan
hyväätarkoittavan, mutta löyhän ja hetkellisen aatteilun,
suuntailun Ja intoilun leimaa löytämättä missään todellisuuden,
olevaisuuden ja lahjomattoman käytännöllisyyden vankkaa
kulmakiveä. Siellä, missä olisi rakennettava salaperäisen,
näköä vaihtavan, mutta sittenkin pysyväisen yksilöllisen
ihmisluonteen tarkasti vaarinotetuille, tulisella sydämellä
tunnetuille ja kylmällä lahjomattomalla järjellä tajutuille ja
harkituille ominaisuuksille, siellä on pidetty silmällä vain
yleisen, hetkellisen mielipiteen joka hetki väriä ja muotoa
vaihtavaa, alati virtailevaa pintaa. On rakennettu virran kuplille ja
tuulen vaihteleville vireille, hetken näkö- ja luuloajatuksille ja
mielen pyräyksille siellä, missä olisi ollut rakennettava elämän
pysyvälle pohjalle: ihmisluonteen ja elämän todellisuuden vaikeasti
tavoiteltavalle, mutta olevalle perustalle. Yhteiskunnallinen
rakentaminen ei ole lapsen ilmavaa, oikullista, mielivaltaista
leikkimistä, vaan kypsän miehen ja mielen uurasta, syvyyksiin
tunkeutuvaa työtä, eikä sitä kudota hetken mielioikuista ja
mielenpistoista, vaan on se kärsivällistä, raskasta ja hidasta,
ihmispolvien yhteistyönä suoritettavaa, hankalan ja vastahakoisen
olevaisen sovittamista, taivuttamista, pakottamista ja sulattamista
ihmisjärjen, ihmistahdon ja ihmistarpeiden mukaiseksi elettäväksi
kokonaisuudeksi.

Suomen kansakin ryhtyessään lapsen uskaliaalla herkkäuskoisuudella
silmänräpäyksessä kyhäilemään, miks'eipä loihtimaan itselleen
aivan alutonta ja pohjatonta sekä sen menneisyydestä että sen
nykyisestä kehitystasosta yhtä irrallista luomaa, kaikissa hetken
aatehelyissä koreilevaa eduskuntajärjestystä leipoikin leivän
asemesta itselleen kiven. Sommitellessaan kaiken vapaamielisen
uusikuosisuuden ja vannoutuneen, oikeaoppisen kansanvaltaisuuden
mukaisen eduskunnan, joka näköään on kansanvaltaisin, mitä toivoa
saattaa, loikin se eduskuntajärjestyksen, jossa kansa vain on
äänestyskone. Eduskunnan todellisen henkilökohtaisen kokoonpanon
määräävät kansan sijasta muutamasataiset henkilöpiirit,
vaalilistojen itsevalitut ja itsevaltiaat laatijat--vieläpä lisäksi
henkilöpiirit, jotka edustavat tyhjintä ja paperisinta
elämänkokemusta, mikä kansasta saattaa kiteytyä:
ammattipolitiikkojen ja ammattisanomalehtimiesten väljähtäneet,
sanojen helinässä paatuneet, henkisesti puolimittaiset ryhmät eri
puolueiden karsinoissa.

Jo muuan ainoa piirre uudessa eduskuntajärjestyksessämme riittää
osoittamaan, miten pintapuoliselle ihmistuntemukselle se on rakennettu
ja miten keinotekoinen ja hetkellisesti järkeilty on sen
elämänkokemuksen perusta. Uudessa eduskuntajärjestyksessämme on
tehty tehottomaksi tai ainakin arveluttavasti hämmennetty kaiken
yhteiskunnallisen järjestäymisen alkeellisin ja väkevin liitevoima,
ihmishengelle luontainen sankarikunnioitus: heikompien vilpitön ja
välitön luottamus väkevämpäänsä kohtaan, ryhmittyminen
luonnollisen johtajansa ympärille, oman mieskohtaisen voiman
vaapaaehtoinen siirtäminen ja omistaminen toisen ihmisen tueksi,
jonka alkuperäinen, luova, kokoova hengen mahti takaa suuremman
saavutuksen kuin oma yksilöllinen ponnistus.

Uudessa eduskuntajärjestyksessämme on tehty aivan näennäiseksi
henkilöä äänestäminen, henkilölle yksilönä, henkilön
mieskohtaisille, taatuille ja koetuille luonneominaisuuksille, hänen
elämän kokemukselleen ja luonteelleen annettu luottamus.
Äänestäessä varmaa, luottamuksen virittänyttä henkilöä
luiskahtaakin ääni tämän henkilön ohitse jotain
merkillisiä--itse vaaliliittymään piilotettuja, puoluekanslioiden
siihen kätkemiä--kimmahdusteitä aivan odottamattomalle,
äänestäjän sisäiselle luottamukselle tyyten vieraalle ja
yhdentekevälle henkilölle. Eduskuntajärjestyksemme johtaa ja
pakoittaa äänestämään, ei henkilöä, vaan puoluetta.
Mieskohtainen luottamus on kohdistettava henkilön sivutse
epäpersoonalliselle puolueelle, ja katkaisee eduskuntajärjestyksemme
täten väkevimmän ja luonnollisimman tunneliitekohdan yksilön ja
yhteiskunnallisen harrastuksen väliltä.

Täten muodostuvalta eduskunnaltakin katoo välittömän edustavuuden
teho ja arvovalta. Kukaan ei yksilökohtaisesti tunne eduskunnassa
juuri hänen omalla, suoralla, välittömällä äänestämisellään
sinne valtuuttamaansa henkilöä, vaan tuntuvat eduskunnan jäsenet
naiville, välittömälle yleistajunnalle istuvan tehtävissään
joidenkin syrjäisten voimien sinne keinottelemina. Kaikesta
yleisestä äänioikeudesta huolimatta vaikuttaa vaalijärjestyksen
keinotekoisuus sen, ettei kansa välittömästi tunne ja tunnusta
eduskuntaa omakseen, omaksi yhteiskunnalliseksi parhaimmistokseen,
oman yhteiskunnallisen tahtonsa välittömäksi elimeksi.

Hedelmästä puu tunnetaan! Kun vaalijärjestyksen seula, jonka olisi
sihdattava Suomen kansasta esille sen yhteiskunnalliseen
lainsäädäntöön kykenevin ja pätevin valiomiehistö, toimii
siten, että melkeinpä puolet eduskunnan jäsenistä ovat ruumenia,
vain perin alkeellisesti pystyvät minkäänlaiseen älylliseen,
rakentavaan yhteiskuntatyöhön, niin se ei todista hyvää tämän
seulan rakenteesta. Edustajistossamme istuu paljon henkilöitä,
joiden sijasta siellä yhtä tuloksellisesti eduskunnan työkyvylle ja
melkoista huokeammilla kuluilla yhteiskunnalle voisi istua vaikkapa
asianomaisten puolueiden väreillä maalattuja automaattisia
äänestysnukkeja--valitut saman suhteellisen vaaliponnistuksen mukaan
kuin muutkin edustajat, varustetut näiden kanssa samoilla
äänestysoikeuksilla ja merkityt kukin omalla
otsikkokirjoituksellaan: n.n. puolueen naisasian harrastelu, n.n.
puolueen torpparikalastus, kristillismielisyys j.n.e.--Tällaisia
periaatteellisia istujia ja automaattisia äänestäjiä kuuluu
jokaiseen puolueryhmään, ja ovatkin ne mukana vain asianomaisten
puolueiden kansan- ja naisvaltaisina dekoratsiooneina.

Erikoisen runsaasti on näitä tällaisia pelkästään
dekoratiivisiä istujia sosialistisen puolueryhmän sekä
naisedustajain piireissä. Naisluonteelle ominainen yleiskatsauksen
puute--kykenemättömyys kylmäverisesti abstrahoimaan
yksityisseikoista niitä hallitsevaa yleispiirteistä,
järkivoittoista kokonaisuutta--ja tätä ominaisuutta seuraava
näkökulman yksipuolisuus, yksityisseikkainen kiihkoilu ja arvioinnin
hätiköivä liioittelu ja suhdattomuus, yleensä yhteiskunnallisen
vaiston ohuus tekee naisen osanoton yhteiskunnalliseen
lainsäädäntöön yleensä oikulliseksi, epätasaiseksi,
epävarmaksi ja epäjohdonmukaiseksi.

Eduskunnan valtaryhmän, sosialidemokraattisen puolueen edustajat ovat
niinikään runsaissa määrin pelkkää kuollutta painolastia
rakentavassa lainsäädäntötyössä. Ahdas ja niukka
elämänkokemus, muutamiin kaavanomaisiin ja sulattamattomiin
puolueoppilauseihin kivettynyt henkinen näköpiiri, melkein
täydellinen tottumattomuus älylliseen ja käsitteelliseen
työskentelyyn tekevät useat tämän puolueen jäsenet melkein
kykenemättömiksi mihinkään muuhun positiiviseen tehtävään
eduskunnassa kuin periaatteelliseen istumiseen, uskollisiin
äänestysuurnalle kävelyihin valppaampien puoluetoverien ohjeitten
mukaisesti tai »toverien» valmistamien puheitten paukuttamiseen
puhujalavalta. Lisäksi istuu tässä puolueessa vielä runsaammin
kuin porvaripuolueissa kieroon kasvaneita kiihkoilijoita ja oman
ahdasnäköisyytensä pimittämiä fanatiikkoja, joiden älyn
pimentoon yhteiskunta ja yhteiskunnallisen kokonaisuuden tarpeet
näkyvät vain omien umpinaisten, sulkevien puoluemuurien ratkelmitse
ja jotka eivät hituistakaan lisää enempää eduskunnan
asiantuntemuksen rikkautta ja monipuolisuutta kuin elämänkokemuksen
inhimillisyyttäkään ja laajuutta tai luonteellista arvoa ja
ryhtiä.

Uuden uutukainen, kansanvaltaisesti puhdasoppinen
eduskuntajärjestyksemme suhteellisine, nais- ja yleisine
äänioikeuksineen on siis luonut yhteiskunnalliselle
työskentelyllemme elimen, josta vain murto-osa on kelpoinen ja
kykenevä vaatimattomaankin yhteiskunnalliseen luomis- ja
rakennustyöhön.

Luonteeton, pintapuolinen järkeily on eduskuntajärjestyksen
muovailemisessa kuten kaikkialla muuallakin, missä se yrittelee
alutonta ja pohjatonta sepitsemistään, hiuksenhienoissa
johteluissaan ja harkituissa suuntailuissaan unohtanut ja sivuuttanut
elämän läheiset, elävät ja vaikuttavat voimat ja tässäkin
tapauksessa pystynyt kyhäämään vain näennäisen onton varjoluoman
vailla elämän todellisuuden sisältöä, pontta ja kehittymisen
ainesta. Missä on kutsumattomassa luomisessa unohdettu ja sivuutettu
elämän elävät mahdit, siellä sivuuttaa lopulta elämä yhtä
ylväästi ja unohtavasti tällaisen luoman kuin se alkuvaiheessaan on
sivuuttanut elämän.


       *       *       *       *       *




SIVISTYKSELLISIÄ LAATUPIIRTEITÄ.





AATTEELLINEN HARRASTELU.


Tämä epäyksilöllisyys, yksilöllisyyden sekä kehittymättömyys
että sen merkityksen tajuamattomuus, joka niin hallitsevasti
luonnehtii julkista yhteiselämäämme, esiytyy tietysti vielä
selkeämpänä ja vallitsevampana varsinaisessa yksilöllisessä
elämänsuhtautumisessa ja mieskohtaisessa hengenviljelyksessä.

Ken ankaralla ja lahjomattomalla silmällä tarkkailee henkisen
elämän ja henkisen harrastuksen ilmiöitä suomenkielisissä
sivistyspiireissä, hänelle selkeneekin nopeasti, kuinka hataraa
yksilöllinen viljely meillä vielä toistaiseksi on. Tämä
yksilöllinen viljeltymättömyys ilmenee niin yksilöiden omissa
elämän harrastuksissa kuin henkisten joukkovirtausten laadussakin.
Niin hyvin yksilöllisesti kuin yhteiskunnallisesti on henkinen
suhtautuminen yht'aikaa sekä hidasta että herkkäuskoista.

On vaikeata virittää suomalaisessa ilmakehässä puhtaasti henkisen
harrastuksen liekkiä. Yksilöt, yksilöllinen tahto ja äly uinuvat
vielä jonkinmoisessa horroksen verhossa. Pelkästään omalla
asiallisella totuudellaan tehoava sana ja henkinen määrittely
raukeaa älylliselle tajunnalle voimattomana; sellainen ikäänkuin
tukahtuu yleiseen ajatuksen herpouteen, erillisen, itsenäisen,
mieskohtaisen ajatus- ja suhtaumiskyvyn untuneisuuteen. Älyllisen
selkeyden tarve, intellektualinen vilpittömyys on vielä
kehkenemätön. On vielä tuntematon ja kokematon se älyn ilmava
liekki ja leikki, joka löytää viileän tyydytyksensä elämän
ilmiöiden puhtaassa, lahjomattomassa huomioitsemisessa ja
määrittelemisessä, elämän vapaassa, omista mieliteoista
irtautuneessa tajuamisessa ja älyllisessä omistamisessa.

Hengen ilmiöt tajutaan vielä aivan naivisti, niin sanoakseni
käytännöllisesti: niiden tilapäinen, elämällinen hyödykkyys
eikä niiden teoreettinen, ihmiseduista ja mielihaluista riippumaton
totuuspitoisuus ratkaisee niiden kiinnearvon. Tyydytään
aatteelliseen tarkoitusperään silloin kun olisi tunkeuduttava
aatteelliseen sisältöön. Aatteellinen ja älyllinen
elämänselvittely ei sinään ole riittävä kiihotin hengen
herättämiseksi toimintaan, vaan on aatteellisen harrastuksen
valjastauduttava jonkin käytännöllisen tarkoitusperän palvelukseen
tullakseen tajutuksi.

Yleensä on suomenkieliselle sivistykselle ja sivistyneistölle
tunnusmerkillistä puhtaan henkisen harrastuksen sijasta aatteellinen
harrastelu. Kun hengenviljely vielä on niin alkuasteellaan, ettei
ihmisellä ole ainesta yksilöllisempään eetillisten ja
taiteellisten elämänarvojen itsenäiseen, alkuperäiseen ja
puhtaaseen tajuamiseen, yleensä yksilölliseen elämän selvittelyyn,
niin sivuutetaan yksinkertaisesti tämä työläs ahdinkoinen viljely,
ja purjehditaan lavein purjein yhteiskunnallisen parannustyön
väljille vesille. Kun ei ole hengen kiintonaisuutta ja tarmoa ainoaan
satoisaan hengentyöhön, itsekasvatukseen, oman yksilöllisen
elämäntuntemuksen ja -kokemuksen syvemmäksi ja tietoisammaksi
viljelyyn, niin livahdetaan kevyesti tämän raskaan ja ainoan
ihmisarvoisen elämäntehtävän ohitse, ja aletaan kasvattaa itsensä
sijasta muita ihmisiä, harjoittaa helppohintaisinta ja
hyödyttömintä hyväntekeväisyyttä, siveellispedagoogista.

Suomenkielisen sivistyneistön henkinen harrastuspiiri kohdistuu ja
rajoittuukin arveluttavassa määrässä juuri tällaiseen
yleishyödylliseen suuntaan. Eräät sinään terveelliset ja
yhteiskunnallisesti tärkeät ja hyödylliset erikoisharrastukset ovat
suomenkielisen yleisön suurelle osalle muodostuneet kaiken henkisen
harrastuksen surrogaateiksi, joiden palveluksessa pauhaaminen
vapauttaa kaikesta julistajaan itseensä kohdistuvasta mieskohtaisesta
hengen viljelyksestä. Minkä tahansa ahtaan ja ulkopuolisen, vaikka
itsessään hyödyllisen ja tarpeellisen erikoisaatteen harrastaminen
ja levittäminen kasvaa henkisesti tottumattomissa aivoissa
suhteettomaan aatteelliseen ja eetilliseen arvoon, muodostuu
laajoille, henkisiin elämänarvoihin tottumattomille yleisöpiireille
ikäänkuin kaiken aatteellisen harrastuksen, kaiken siveellisen
itsekurin tunnusmerkiksi ja pimittää näiltä näköalat muille
vapaammille, laajemmille henkisen elämän ulapoille. Tyydytään ja
tyrehdytään kaikenmoisiin puoliaatteisiin, ohjataan satamaan jo
ennen ulapalle saapumistakin, laskeudutaan hengen työläästä, jos
ihanastakin avaruus- ja korkeuslennosta lähimmän kotikatajan oksalle
levähtämään. Missä on lähdetty lentoon noustaksi ja kohotaksi
hengen siintäviin avaruuksiin, tupsahdetaankin lähimpään,
viritettyyn käytännöllisen ja typpeän erikoisaatteilun verkkoon ja
sirkutellaan ja raksutellaan siinä, ikäänkuin jo olisivat kaikki
taivasten salit saavutetut.

Jos missä, niin meillä on otollinen maaperä kaikenlaatuisille
seikkaileville aatesuunnille. Älyllinen arvostelu on niin haparoiva
ja kehittymätön vielä, ettei se voi omavaraisesti eroittaa kultaa
kuonasta. Vasta kun ajatus viskautuu todesta seikkailevaksi,
määrittelystä harhailevaksi haaveiluksi, johtopäätelmällisestä
ankaruudesta utopistiseksi suuntailuksi, vasta kun filosofia vaihtuu
teosofiaksi, yhteiskunnallinen rakennustyö sosialistiseksi tai
puolueuskonnoksi, yksilöllinen taisteleva, problemaattinen vakaumus
muodin ja joukkohuumauksen mukaan vannovaksi kategooriseksi
yleisvarmuudeksi, vasta silloin voi sillä olla maaperää
suomalaisessa yleishengessä--jopa ylen otollinenkin maaperä.

Herkkäuskoisessa hurmiossa suistutaan jokaisen ylimalkaisen,
parannusta lupailevan tunnuslauseen mukaan, haltioidutaan sitä
ehdottomammin, mitä ahtaammin tai julkeammin noiden »aatteiden»
julistajat vain osaavat esittää keppihevosensa kaiken maallisen ja
taivaallisen siunauksen vuoretkin aukaisevana, viheriöivänä
Moses-sauvana. Meidän julistajamme--olkoot sitte teosofeja tai
tolstoilaisia, Prometheus-ihmisiä tai siviiliavioliittomarttyyrejä,
Kalevala-kalervoisia tai piilopirtti- ja tuohikulturisteja,
esperantisteja tai puhdaskielisyyspyöveleitä, kolmisointusinisukkia
tai eläinsuojelusharrastajia, naisasianaisia tai siveyssaarnaajia,
pappis- tai kasvissyöjiä, perustuslaillisia tai kansallismielisiä,
kristillismielisiä tai nuorisoseura-aatteilijoita, sosialisteja tai
raittiusprofeettoja, kansanvalistajia tai aatteellisia
henkivakuuttajia, osuustoimintaväkeä tai maahenkikiivailijoita,
kotiseutulahkolaisia tai maatiaiskarjaintoilijoita, urheiluhoukkoja
tai kinttuapostoleja, luontaisparantajia tai rokotuskauhuilijoita,
kuhnijoita tai myllertäjiä y.m., y.m. henkisiä tai ruumiillisia
puoskareita--mitä henkistä kulkutautia, hienompaa tai karkeampaa
sairastanevatkin--kaikki ovat he löytäneet ainoan ja lopullisen,
autuaaksi tekevän uskonsa. Kukin niistä on siepannut alkuperäisesti
ehkä eheästäkin elämänkatsomus-yhteydestä irrallisen,
liioitellun ajatuksen sirusensa, jolla sitte huitoo itään jos
länteen, hyvän jos huonon sään aikana kuin mikäkin
kääpiö-Simson aasinleukaluullaan, niin että siinä silmät alkavat
kirjavoitua jo muiltakin kuin filistealaisilta.

Tällaiset löyhäpäiset ja vielä löyhäsuisemmat aateritarit,
joita ei suinkaan näkemyksen totuus, ajatuksen syvyys, tunteen tuli
ole julistajan tehtävään kutsunut, vaan ainoastaan pelkkä hyvä
suu ja liukas kieli, joutilas pää ja epäkaino sydän katsovat
meillä itsensä maan suolaksi ja--mikä pahempi!--käyvät meillä
sellaisesta.

       *       *       *       *       *

Sivistyksellisiä ja henkisiä erikoisilmiöitä ovatkin meillä juuri
tällaiset kaiken jalon, kaiken ylevän, kaiken ihanteellisen,
yleensä kaiken kauniilta ja taivaiselta vilahtelevan ja valehtelevan
aatteellisuuden papit ja papittaret, nuo, jotka suu ja rinta ilmaa
täynnä vaeltavat puhujalavalta puhujalavalle ja
selittämättömässä sanahaltioitumisessa puhuvat sinisiin ilmoihin
milloin isänmaasta ja kotiseudusta, milloin raittiudesta ja
maahengestä, milloin sosiaalisesta yhteishengestä, milloin mistäkin
kauniista, jalosta, ylevästä, joka vain antaa tilaa ja tuulta
sanojen purjeille, ja jotka humaltuneessa hurmiossa vain tahtovat
kasvattaa, kasvattaa! yhden tekevää mihin, kunhan vain kasvatetaan,
kunhan vain »nuoriso herää, kansa virkoaa, mielet valveutuvat».

Tämä kasvattaminen kasvattamisen vuoksi, tämä herättäminen,
valveuttaminen pelkän herättämisen, valveuttamisen vuoksi--olkoon
herääminen ja valveutuminen miten ainekseton, aiheeton ja
päämäärätön hyvänsä ja jääköön näiden herätettyjen
elämänsisältö miten ontoksi, ohueksi ja epämääräiseksi
tahansa--saattaa henkisen elämänaineksen ja elämäntehtävän
puuttuessa käydä tuhoisaksikin näille herätyksen uhreille, saattaa
suistaa heidät totutuista elämänkäsityksistä ja totutuilta
elämänradoilta antamatta mitään elettyä, mitään varmaa
elämänpohjaa tilalle muuta kuin heliseviä sanoja, puoliksi tai
väärin tajuttuina nekin.

Niinpä tapaakin meillä taajaan näitä intomielisyyden uhreja,
joiden henkinen sisältö rajoittuu muutamaan sulattamattomana
hänelle annettuun ja hänen vielä sulattamattomampana omistamaansa
aateparteen, joille tämän aatteen murusen omistaminen on ollut
ikäänkuin henkisesti ylivoimainen teko, niin että kaikki henkinen
vastaanottokyky ja itsekasvatuksen mahti senjälkeen on tyrehtynyt
heissä. Kivettyneesti valmiina rientävät hekin taas vuorostaan
kuumaltaan julistelemaan uutta aatettaan, levittelemään sitä yhä
laajemmille piireille yhä väljempänä, ohuempana,
epämääräisempänä ja tyhjempänä kuta useamman aivon lävitse ja
puhujalavan kautta se on kulkenut. Itse kasvattajillekin ovat tämän
»kasvatuksen» seuraukset yhtä turmiollisia. Sensijaan että
työläässä ja uurtavassa tai runsaassa ja riemukkaassa työssä
kamppailisivat oman henkisen sisältönsä itselleen selkeäksi ja
elämänomaksi, rientävät »kansaa valistelevat» nuorukaisemme ja
neitosemme opinsirusen siepattuaan tai aatteen älyttyään heti
kuumaltaan saarnailemaan sitä toisten ihmisten, »kansan»
kasvatukseksi. Jonkun kauniin lauseparren huikaisemina viskautuvat he,
keskenkasvaneet toisia kasvattamaan, sokeat sokeiden
taluttajiksi--tyrkyttäytyvätpä välistä näkevienkin taluttajiksi:
pauhaavat aikuisille, työssä harmaantuneille ihmisille
elämänopetuksiaan, niin että syrjäinenkin saa vuoroin hymyillä
vuoroin häpeästä punastua puhujan viheriälle viattomuudelle.

Tässä touhuamisessaan saarnaavat nämä vireät nuorukaisemme hengen
asiat itselleen kuolleiksi kirjaimiksi. Kun he lopulta astuvat
todelliseen elämäntyöhönsä, ovat he jääneet henkisesti ja
yksilöllisesti kehittymättömiksi. Aatteet ja ihanteet ovat heille
kuluneet tyrtymiseen asti tyhjennetyiksi, hengettömiksi
lauseparsiksi, joita kyllä vielä välistä käytetään suussa,
mutta jotka eivät ole elämäntyön pohjana, henkisenä,
siveellisenä kannattajana ja sisältönä.--Kun todellisen henkisen
harrastuksen ainoa elävä lähde ja pohja, oma yksilöllisyys on
jäänyt heissä viljelyksen ja aineksen puutteesta surkastumaan,
saattavat nämä aatteellisesti ja ihanteellisesti »heränneet»
nuorukaiset myöhemmässä varsinaisessa elämäntyössään
jäykistyä mitä autioimpaan henkiseen puisevuuteen ja
turtuneisuuteen.

On unohdettu, että yksilön tehtävä ei ole toisten ihmisten
kehityksestä, vaan omasta kehittymisestään huolehtiminen, ja että
yhteiskunnankin palveluksessa vain se yksilö voi suorittaa jotakin
todellista, pätevää ja rakentavaa, jolla on annettavana työaseeksi
tähän yhteiskunnalliseen työhön valmiiksi viljelty yksilöllisyys,
tietoisuuden tehoon kehitetty yksilöllinen ja henkinen kypsyys.




EPÄYKSILÖLLISYYS ELÄMÄNTYÖSSÄ.


Tämä valeaatteellinen hengensuunta löyhentää meillä aivan
käytännöllistä elämäntartuntaakin. Toiminnallisesti
tähdellisilläkin elämänaloilla saa usein ratkaisu- ja
määräämisvallan aatteellinen yleishyvällinen tarkoitusperä eikä
käytännöllinen toteuttamisarvo ja asiallinen tärkeys.

Jo elämänurien valinnassa saavat ylimalkaiset ja pintapuoliset
aatteelliset sivuvaikuttimet yksilöä harhauttavan arvon ja
merkityksen. Kun luonnollinen lähtökohta hedelmälliselle
ihmistyölle on se, että ihminen tuntee itsessään voiman ja
kutsumuksen jonkin tehtävän suorittamiseen ja tämän
toteuttamiseksi omistautuu koko luonteensa painolla työlleen, niin on
työskentelyn lähtökohta meillä usein toinen, epäpersoonallisempi,
»aatteellisempi». Elämäntehtävään ei kutsu vääjäämätön
vaisto, luonteen taipumus, vaan ainoastaan yleinen, periaatteellinen,
epäyksilöllinen harkinta, löyhä ja ulkopuolinen laskeminen, joko
pelkästään itsekäs etujen ja nousemisen tavoittelu tai
väärinkäsitetty luulovelvollisuus.

Tällaisia henkisiä järkiavioliittoja tehtävän ja tekijän
välillä sitä seuraavine ilmiöineen elämäntehtävän
suorittamisessa tapahtuu suomalaisella sivistysvainiolla paljon. Niin
tieteen kuin taiteen, niin yhteiskunnallisen ja valtiollisen toiminnan
kuin käytännöllisen ja liike-elämänkin aloilla tapaa meillä
runsaasti puolikykyjä, joilla on taidollisesti saavutettavissa oleva
työn rutiini, muodollinen menettelytaito, mutta joiden sisäinen
suhde valitsemaansa työalaan on täydellisesti hedelmätön ja kylmä
ja joilta siitä syystä puuttuu kaikki yksilöllinen luova voima
työssänsä.

Tapaa suomalaisia liikemiehiä, jotka ovat liikemiehiä periaatteen
vuoksi--»suomalaistenkin on vallattava liikemaailma»--ei siksi että
heidän luonteessaan asuisi harrastus ja pakko toteuttamaan itsensä
liike-elämän rautaisessa ja taidokkaassa järjestämisessä. Tämän
mukaista onkin sitte usein heidän liiketoimintansa. He eivät
elämänikäänsä kotiudu, pätevisty tehtäviinsä, saa
elämäntehtäväänsä ikäänkuin omiin kouriinsa. Heidän
silmällään ei ole luonnon antamaa terävyyttä, heidän
kädellään luontaista taitoa, kätevyyttä ja jäntevyyttä
tarkkaamaan ja tahdon mukaan ohjaamaan taloudellisten ilmiöiden
oikukasta, vuolahtelevaa virtaa, ei sitä asiallisuuden tarmoa ja
intohimon uskallusta, joka tanakasti, paljain käsin tarttuisi
elämän oleellisuutta sarviin ja taivuttaisi, pakoittaisi sen
tottelemaan palavaa ihmistahtoa. Ja niinpä jäävätkin he vain
näköliikemiehiksi, pelkiksi liikemiestä näytteleviksi
touhuilijoiksi, joiden hatara käsi ja harhaileva silmä vain
päällisin puolin ja umpimähkään haparoi niillä ilmiöillä ja
voimilla, joita heidän olisi hallittava.

Suomalaisissa liikemiespiireissä onkin runsaasti sellaista löyhää
ainesta, joka häärää hommissaan »onnen kaupalla», jonka
liiketoiminta ei perustu kovan, kylmän järjen laskelmiin ja
laskelmien johdonmukaiseen, terävään toteuttamiseen, vaan
ylimalkaiseen, summittaiseen toivorikkauteen. Tällaiset
»summamutikka» liikemiehet livastuvatkin etupäässä varsin
näennäiseen ja epäproduktiiviseen liiketoimintaan: valmiilla,
luoduilla omaisuuksilla keinottelemiseen. Sensijaan että he
mielikuvituksellaan vaistoaisivat ja työllään loisivat
mahdollisuudet ja edellytykset uusille antoisille liikeyrityksille,
että he huomioittensa asiallisuuden ja syvällisyyden perustuksella
tunkeutuisivat ja pääsisivät uusille liike-elämän urille ja
lähteille ja johtaisivat näidenkin elvyttävät vedet yleisen
taloudellisen elämän julkivirtaan, että he luovassa, todellisessa
liiketoiminnassa noutaisivat ja kohottaisivat päivän ja toiminnan
valoon yhteiskuntakokonaisuuden salauumenissa piilleet
pääoma-aiheet, sensijaan tyytyvät he leikkimään vain kuollutta,
hedelmätöntä, umpimähkäistä noppapeliä jo luoduilla ja
muodostuneilla pääoma-arvoilla: ostavat ja myyvät maatiloja ja
hevosia, kaupunkikiinteistöjä ja tehdas- ja pankki-osakkeita,
henkivakuutuskirjoja ja paperiomaisuuksia.

Sitenpä muuntaa tosiasioiden paino ja oma löyhä ja pinnallinen
suhtautuminen omaan elämäntehtävään tällaisen alkuaan ehkä
vilpittömänkin aatteenpalvoja-liikemiehen silkaksi keinottelijaksi,
liikemiestoiminnan aatteellisesti tarkoituksettomimman ja
kyynillisesti itsekkäimmän ihmistyypin edustajaksi, tuoksi
taloudelliseksi rosvoritariksi, joka itse mitään luomatta
kärkkyelee taloudellisen elämän elävän virran varrella
siepatakseen sen paperivaahdosta valmiin satasen sieltä, tuhantisen
tuolta, mutta aina itse myöskin altisna tämän samaisen oikullisen
virran hahmaiseville pyörteille, yhtä läsnä miljoonien mahtia kuin
vararikon kuiluakin, yhtä kypsänä yhteiskunnallisen valtamiehen
luottamusasemaan kuin nimenväärentäjän vankikoppiinkin.

Tapaa tiedemiehiä, joihin odottamatta onkin kätketty liike- ja
käytännönmies, ja joille saavutettu tohtoruus tai professorinistuin
merkitsee yht'-äkkistä selkeytymistä omasta varsinaisesta
elämäntehtävästä. Syrjäisen tutkijakammionsa viileästä,
eristetystä hiljaisuudesta pöllähtävätkin nämä luulotellut
minervalinnut yht'äkkiä maailman kirjavalle markkinaturulle
täysisiipisinä Merkuriuksina. Ylen tuttujahan ovat keskuudessamme
liike--ei! vaan tiede--ei! vaan liike-tiedemiehet, jotka
juoksevat--ei kirjastoissa ja arkistoissa, vaan pankeissa ja
pörsseissä; jotka urkkivat--ei tieteellisiä aikakauskirjoja, vaan
kurssilistoja; jotka pohtivat--ei tieteensä ongelmia, vaan tontti- ja
kiinteistöarvojen nousua ja laskua; jotka kantavat paksuissa
salkuissaan--ei tieteellisiä muistiinpanoja, vaan vekselilomakkeita
ja osakekirjoja; jotka harrastelevat--ei kansantalouttaan, vaan
yksityistalouttaan--ja alinomaisella liikekannalla ollen siinä
lomassa pistäytyvät nostamassa professorin-palkkansa tai
dosentuuri-apurahansa.

Tapaa politiikkoja ja sanomalehtimiehiä--heitä on jo laajemmin
käsitelty puolue- ja sanomalehti-olojamme kuvattaessa--jotka ovat
politiikkoja ja sanomalehtimiehiä vain näytelläkseen julkisen ja
yhteiskunnallisen toiminnan mahti- ja hommamiestä ja kohistakseen
ylimalkaan kaikissa mahdollisissa ja mahdottomissa asioissa ilman
että heillä sydämellään on ainoatakaan asiaa, jonka toteuttaminen
pakottaisi tai ajaisi heidät tähän julkiseen toimintaan. Nämä
yhteiskuntaharrastelua keikaroivat esiytyisivät itselleen ja
luonteelleen paljoa otollisemmassa valaistuksessa, jos kätkisivät
älynsä kynttiläpätkäsen vakinaisen toimialansa vaatimattomaan
vakkaseen ja rajoittaisivat julkisuusmies-haaveensa ja -pyyteensä
niihin juhlahetkiin, jolloin nuoruudessaan pääsevät johtamaan
franseesikarkeloa, vanhuudessaan pitämään paistipuheita.

Tapaa estetiikkoja ja kirjallisia arvostelijoita, tapaa taiteellisten
laitosten johtajia, työtarmoisia ja elokkaitakin joiden
hengenominaisuuksissa vain ei parhaalla tahdollakaan voi havaita
yksilöllisen taide-elämyksen vaistoa, sisäistä, mieskohtaista,
elävää tunnesuhdetta taideilmiöihin. Kysyy hämmästellen, mikä
ihme on vetänyt juuri heidät--ilmeiset ja luontaiset
yhteiskunnallisen työskentelyn miehet, joiden käytännöllinen ja
kylmä, mutta tunnelmallisesta tuiki rajoitettu ja niukka
selväpäisyys, älyllinen, jäykkä suoraviivaisuus ja toiminnallinen
kunnianhimo vasta yhteiskunnallisessa työssä ja vaikutuksessa tai
jollakin käytännöllisen toiminnan alalla, laajan maanviljelyksen,
monihaaraisen liiketoiminnan järjestämisessä olisi päässyt
luonnollisiin oikeuksiinsa--mikä ihme on juuri heidät,
taidevaistottomat, vetänyt arkojen, etupäässä ja pääasiassa
herkkää, altista, mieskohtaista henkistä vastaanottokykyä
vaativain kaunotieteellisten kysymysten käsittelemiseen. Oman
luonteensa rajojen vuoksi on heidän näillä aloilla aina liikuttava
vieraalla, oudolla ja arveluttavasti epävarmalla pohjalla ja
ainaiseksi rajoituttava pelkkään ulkoa älyttävään ja ulkoa
opittuun muodolliseen järjestelemiseen ja muodolliseen tajuamiseen,
kuolleeseen luokittelemiseen. He eivät voi oman sisäisen
välittömän näkemyksensä turvissa ja valtuuttamina käydä
itsenäisesti ja alkuperäisyyden luovalla itse- ja omavallalla
käsittelemään taiteellisen elämän arkoja ilmiöitä.

Nämä estetiikkomme samaten kuin heidän varsin läheiset
hengenheimolaisensa, meidän »metafyysisesti tuijottelevan» kansamme
harvalukuiset »filosofit» ja elämäntutkistelijat, ovat henkisessä
epämääräisyydessään ja värittömyydessään, näkemyksensä
ylimalkaisuudessa, arkuudessa ja innottomuudessa, ilmaisunsa
väljähtäneessä unisessa laimeudessa, tuntopiirinsä harmaassa,
kuivassa, matalassa arkisuudessa, koko hengensävynsä laimeassa,
sovinnaisessa, järkeilevässä kalseudessa ja jäykkyydessä eksyneet
alalle, jolla vain terävä ja yksilöllinen tunteen ja älyn
intensiteetti voi avata työalat avoimiksi työskentelevälle
hengelle.

Niin esteettisessä kuin siveellisessä elämänselvittelyssä voi
vain se ihminen, jolla on ehtymättömänä sisäisenä
havainto-aarteistonaan ja työaineistonaan syvä ja laaja, tuntemisen
tulessa herkistetty ja kypsytetty, järjen k
