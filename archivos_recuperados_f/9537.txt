uu°rrwhatever you ask!â€ said Joe, to the tallest of the savages.

The Indian, if he did not understand his captiveâ€™s words, seemed to
comprehend his terrors, and was much diverted at his ludicrous
expression of features.

â€œOh pray! good Mr. Chiefâ€”â€

â€œKeep your mouth shet! Theyâ€™ll never git through torturing us, if you
let â€™em know youâ€™re afraid,â€ said Sneak.

â€œThatâ€™s just what I want,â€ said Joe; â€œI donâ€™t want them to ever quit
torturing usâ€”because theyâ€™ll never quit till weâ€™re both dead. But as
long as they laugh at theyâ€™ll be sure to let me live.â€

Ere long, the savages with their captives, entered the dense grove
where Mary had been taken, before they set out with her over the
prairie. But it was evidently not their intention to conduct their
present prisoners to their villages, and demand a ransom for them. Nor
were they prepared to convey them away in the same dignified and
comfortable manner, over the snow-clad plains. They anticipated a
gratification of a different nature. They had been disappointed in all
their attempts to obtain booty from the whites. The maid they had taken
had been recaptured, and their chief was in the possession of the
enemy. These, to say nothing of the loss of a score of their brethren
by the fire-weapons of the white men, stimulated them with unerring
precision to compass the destruction of their prisoners. Blood only
could satiate their vengeful feelings. And the greater and longer the
sufferings of their victims the more exquisite would be the luxury of
revenge. And this caused them to smile with positive delight when they
witnessed the painful terrors of poor Joe.

When they reached their place of encampment, which was in the midst of
a cluster of small slim trees that encircled an old spreading oak of
huge dimensions, the savages made their prisoners stand with their
backs against two saplings that grew some fifteen paces apart. They
were compelled to face each other, that they might witness every thing
that transpired. Their arms were bound round the trees behind them, and
a cord was likewise passed round their legs to confine them more
securely. The savages then seemed to consult about the manner of
despatching them. The oldest and most experienced, by his hasty
gestures and impatient replies, appeared to insist on their
instantaneous death. And from his frequent glances northward, through
the trees, he doubtless feared some interruption, or dreaded the
arrival of an enemy that might inflict an ample retaliation. During a
long pause, while the Indians seemed to hesitate, and the old crafty
savage drew his steel tomahawk from his belt, Sneak sighed deeply, and
said, in rather mournful tonesâ€”

â€œThe jigâ€™s up with us, Joe. If I was only loose seven seconds, you
wouldnâ€™t ketch me dying like a coon here agin a tree.â€ Joe made no
other response than a blubbering sound, while the tears ran down and
dropped briskly from his chin.

[Illustration: Joe and Sneak in difficulty.]


The savages gave vent to a burst of laughter when they beheld the agony
of fear that possessed their captive. The three that were in favour of
the slow torture now turned a deaf ear to the old warrior, and advanced
to Joe. They held the palms of their hands under his chin, and caught
the tears as they fell. They then stroked his head gently, and appeared
to sympathize with the sufferer.

â€œMr. Indian, if youâ€™ll let me go, Iâ€™ll give you my gun and twenty
dollars,â€ said Joe, appealing most piteously to the one that placed his
hand on his head. The Indian seemed to understand him, and held his
hand out for the money, while a demoniac smile played on his dark lips.

â€œJust untie my hands,â€ said Joe, endeavouring to look behind, â€œand Iâ€™ll
go right straight home and get them.â€

â€œYou rascalâ€”you want to run away,â€ replied the old Indian, who not only
understood Joeâ€™s language, but could himself speak English imperfectly.

â€œUpon my sacred word and honour, I wonâ€™t!â€ replied Joe.

â€œYou lie!â€ said the savage, bestowing a severe smack on Joeâ€™s face.

â€œOh, Lord! Come now, Mr. Indian, that hurts!â€

â€œNoâ€”donâ€™t hurtâ€”only kill musketer,â€ replied the savage, laughing
heartily, and striking his prisoner on the other side of the face.

â€œOh! hang your skin!â€ cried Joe, endeavouring to break away, â€œif ever I
get you in my power, Iâ€™ll smashâ€”â€ Here his sudden courage evaporated,
and again the tears filled his eyes.

â€œPoor fellow!â€ said the savage, patting his victim on the head. â€œHow
much you give for him?â€ he continued, pointing to Sneak.

â€œIf youâ€™ll only let _me_ go, Iâ€™ll give you every thing Iâ€™ve got in the
world. He donâ€™t want to live as bad as I do, and Iâ€™ll give you as much
for me alone as I will for both.â€

â€œYouâ€™re a purty white man, now, ainâ€™t you?â€ said Sneak. â€œBut its all
the same. My chance is jest as good as yourâ€™n. Theyâ€™re only fooling
you, jest to laugh. Iâ€™ve made up my mind to die, and I ainâ€™t a going to
make any fun for â€™em. And you might as well say your prayers fust as
last; theyâ€™re only playing with you now like a cat with a mice.â€

The old Indian moved towards Sneak, followed by the others.

â€œHow much you give?â€ asked the savage.

â€œNot a coonâ€™s tail,â€ replied Sneak, with firmness.

â€œNow how much?â€ continued the Indian, slapping the thin lank cheek of
his prisoner.

â€œNot a dod-rotted cent! Now jest take your tomahawk and split my skull
open as quick as you kin!â€ said Sneak; and he bowed down his head to
receive the fatal blow.

â€œYou brave rascal,â€ said the Indian, looking his captive in the eye,
and hesitating whether to practice his petty annoyances any further. At
length they turned again to Joe.

â€œThat wasnâ€™t fair, Sneak,â€ cried Joe, when the savages abandoned his
fellow-prisoner; â€œyou ought to have kept them away from me as long as I
did from you.â€

â€œIâ€™m gitting sick of this tanterlizing business,â€ said Sneak. â€œI want
â€™em to git through the job, without any more fooling about it. If you
wasnâ€™t sich a coward, theyâ€™d let you alone, and kill us at once.â€

â€œI donâ€™t want them to kill usâ€”Iâ€™d rather theyâ€™d do any thing in the
world than to kill us,â€ replied Joe.

â€œMe wonâ€™t hurt you,â€ said the old savage, again placing his hand on
Joeâ€™s head; but instead of gently patting it, he wound a lock of hair
round one of his fingers, and with a sudden jerk tore it out by the
roots.

â€œOh, my gracious! Oh, St. Peter! Oh, Lord! Mr. Indian, I beg and pray
of you not to do that any more. If youâ€™ll only untie me, Iâ€™ll get down
on my knees to you,â€ exclaimed poor Joe.

â€œPoor fellow, me wonâ€™t hurt him any moreâ€”poor head!â€ said the Indian,
tearing off another lock.

â€œOh! oh! goodness gracious. _Dear_ Mr. Indian, donâ€™t do that! You can
have no idea how bad it hurtsâ€”I canâ€™t stand it. Iâ€™ll faint presently!â€
said Joe, trembling at every joint.

â€œYouâ€™re a fool,â€ said Sneak, â€œto mind â€™em that way. If you wasnâ€™t to
notice â€™em, they wouldnâ€™t do it. See how theyâ€™re laughing at you.â€

â€œOh, Sneak, I canâ€™t help it, to save my life, indeed I canâ€™t. Oh, my
good Lord, what would I give to be away from here!â€ said Joe, his eyes
fit to burst from their sockets.

â€œIâ€™ve killed many a deer in a minitâ€”it donâ€™t hurt a man to die more
than a deer. I wish the snarvilorous copper-skinned rascals would git
through quick!â€ said Sneak.

â€œMe try you agin,â€ said the savage, again going to Sneak.

â€œWell, now, whatâ€™re you a going to do? Iâ€™m not afraid of you!â€ said
Sneak, grinding his teeth.

â€œMe rub your head,â€ said the savage, seizing a tuft of hair and tearing
it out.

â€œTake some more,â€ said Sneak, bowing down his head.

â€œA little more,â€ iterated the savage, grasping a handful, which, with
much exertion, he severed from the head, and left the white skin
exposed to view.

â€œWonâ€™t you have some more?â€ continued Sneak, without evincing the least
pain. â€œJest take as much as you please; if you tear it off till my
headâ€™s as bald as an egg, I wonâ€™t beg you to let me alone.â€

â€œYou brave fellowâ€”wonâ€™t pull your hair any more,â€ said the chief.

â€œYou be dod rot!â€ said Sneak, contemptuously.

â€œYou mighty brave, shake hands!â€ continued the laughing savage, holding
his hand out in mockery.

â€œIf youâ€™ll untie my foot a minit, Iâ€™ll bet I kick some of the ribs out
of your body. Why donâ€™t you knock our brains out, and be done at once,
you black wolves you!â€ said Sneak.

â€œOh, Sneak! for my sakeâ€”your poor friendâ€™s sake, donâ€™t put such an idea
as that into their heads!â€ said Joe, imploringly.

â€œYouâ€™re a purty friend, ainâ€™t you? Youâ€™d give so _much_ to ransom me!
They aint a going to quit us without killinâ€™ us, and I want it all over
jest as soon as it kin be done.â€

â€œOh, no, Sneak! Maybe theyâ€™ll take pity on us and spare our lives,â€
said Joe, assuming a most entreating look as the savage once more
approached him.

â€œYou make good big Osage; you come with us, if we let you live?â€
demanded the old Indian.

â€œI pledge you my most sacred word and honour I will!â€

â€œYou run away, you rascal,â€ said the savage, plucking another tuft of
hair from Joeâ€™s head.

â€œIâ€™ll be hanged if I stand this any longer!â€ said Joe, striving to
break the cord that confined him.

â€œDonâ€™t notice the black cowards,â€ said Sneak.

â€œHow can I help noticing them, when theyâ€™re pulling out my hair by the
roots!â€ said Joe.

â€œLook where they pulled mine out,â€ said Sneak, turning that part of his
head in view which had been made literally bald.

â€œDidnâ€™t it hurt you?â€ asked Joe.

â€œSartinly it did,â€ said Sneak, â€œbut I grinned and bore it. And now I
wish theyâ€™d pull it all off, and then my scalp wouldnâ€™t do â€™em any
good.â€

â€œThatâ€™s a fact,â€ said Joe. â€œHere, Mr. Osage,â€ he continued, â€œpull as
much hair off the top of my head as you want.â€ The savages, instead of
paying any attention to him, seemed to be attracted by some distant
sound. They stooped down and placed their ears near the earth, and
listened intently for some time. At length they sprang up, and then
ensued another dispute among them about the manner in which the
prisoners should be disposed of. The old savage was yet in favour of
tomahawking the captives and retreating without delay. But the others
would not consent to it. They were not satisfied with the small amount
of suffering yet endured by the prisoners. They were resolved to glut
their savage vengeance. And the prisoners now observed that all traces
of mirth had vanished from their faces. Their eyes gleamed with
fiendish fury, and drawing forth their glittering tomahawks, they
vanished in the thicket, and were soon heard chopping off the small
boughs of the trees.

â€œWhat are they doing Sneak?â€ asked Joe.

â€œDonâ€™t you know what theyâ€™re doing? ainâ€™t they cutting wood as fast as
they kin?â€ replied Sneak.

â€œWell, Iâ€™m not sorry for that.â€ said Joe. â€œbecause its almost dark, and
Iâ€™m getting chilly. If theyâ€™d only give me something to eat, Iâ€™d feel a
heap more comfortable.â€

â€œYou varasherous fool you, theyâ€™re cutting wood to burn us up with. Oh,
I wish I was loose!â€

â€œOh, goodness gracious!â€ cried Joe, â€œI never thought of that! Oh, Iâ€™m
gone!â€

â€œAre you?â€ cried Sneak, eagerly; â€œIâ€™d like to be off too, and weâ€™d give
them a race for it yit.â€

â€œOh! Sneak, I mean Iâ€™m ruined, lost for ever! Oh! St. Peter, pity my
helpless condition!â€

â€œDonâ€™t think about pity now,â€ said Sneak; â€œnothing of that sort is
going to do us any good. We must git loose from these trees and run for
it, or weâ€™ll be roasted like wild turkeys in less than an hour. Iâ€™ve
got one hand loose!â€.

â€œSo have I almost!â€ cried Joe, struggling violently.

â€œOne of â€™emâ€™s coming!â€”shove your hand back, and pertend like youâ€™re
fast, till he goes away agin!â€ said Sneak, in a hurried undertone.

The savage emerged from the bushes the next moment, and after
depositing an armful of billets of wood at the feet of Joe, and walking
round behind the prisoners to see if they were still secure, returned
for more fuel.

â€œNow work for your life!â€ said Sneak, extricating his wrist from the
cord, and striving to get his feet loose.

â€œHang it, Sneak, I canâ€™t get my hand out, though the stringâ€™s quite
loose! Make haste, Sneak, and come and help me,â€ said Joe, in a tone
that indicated his earnestness.

â€œLet every man look out for himself,â€ replied Sneak, tugging away at
the cord that bound his feet to the tree.

â€œOh, Sneak, donâ€™t leave me here, to be burnt by myself!â€ said Joe.

â€œYou wouldnâ€™t promise to give any thing to ransom me, a while agoâ€”Iâ€™ll
cut stick as quick as I kin.â€

â€œOh, Sneak, I canâ€™t untie my hands! If you wonâ€™t help me, Iâ€™ll call the
Indians.â€ But Joe was saved the trouble. He had scarce uttered the word
when all four of the Indians suddenly appeared, and throwing down their
wood, proceeded with much haste to put their horrid purpose in
execution. They heaped up the fagots around their victims, until they
reached half way to their chins, and when all was ready, they paused,
before applying the fire, to enjoy the terrors of their captives.

â€œYou coldâ€”me make some fire to warmâ€”huh,â€ said the old Indian,
addressing Joe, while the others looked on with unmixed satisfaction.

â€œOh! my dear Mr. Osage, if you only knew how much money youâ€™d lose by
killing me, I know youâ€™d let me go!â€ said Joe, in tremulous but
supplicating tones.

â€œYou lieâ€”you got no money,â€ replied the savage; and, stooping down, he
began to split some dry wood into very small pieces to kindle with. Joe
looked on in despair, and seemed to anticipate a blister from every
splinter he saw. It was different with Sneak. Almost hid by the wood
heaped around him, he embraced every opportunity, when the eyes of the
savages were turned away, to endeavour to extricate himself from the
cords that bound him to the tree. Hope had not yet forsaken him, and he
resolved to struggle to the last. When the old savage had split off a
large quantity of splinters and chips, he gathered them up and began to
arrange them in various parts of the pile of green timber preparatory
for a simultaneous ignition. While he was thus engaged, Sneak remained
motionless, and assumed a stoical expression of features. But when he
turned to Joe, Sneak again began to tug at the cord.

â€œOh pray, Mr. Indian!â€ exclaimed Joe, when he saw the savage carefully
placing the combustible matter in all the crevices of the pile around
himâ€”â€œjust only let me off this time, and Iâ€™ll be your best friend all
the rest of your life.â€

â€œMe warm you littleâ€”donâ€™t cryâ€”poor fellow!â€ replied the Indian,
striking a light with flint and steel.

â€œOh, Sneak, if youâ€™ve got a knife, run here and cut me loose, before
Iâ€™m burnt to death!â€ said Joe, in the most heart-moving manner.

â€œKeep your mouth shet!â€ said Sneak; â€œjest wait till they go to put some
fire here, and Iâ€™ll show you a thing or two,â€ he continued, pouring a
handful of _powder_ among the dry splinters. The effect of the
explosion when the Indians attempted to surprise Glennâ€™s premises
occurring to Sneak, and recollecting that he had a quantity of powder
in his pockets, he resolved in his extremity to try its virtue on this
occasion.

â€œBut theyâ€™re going to burn me first! Oh, Lord!â€ exclaimed Joe, as he
beheld the savage applying the fire to the splinters near his feet.

â€œDonâ€™t say nor do nothingâ€”jest wait till they come to me,â€ said Sneak,
with great composure. â€œDo you jess keep your mouth shetâ€”itâ€™ll be a long
while a kindlingâ€”it wonâ€™t begin to burn your legs for an hour.â€

â€œOh, goodness gracious! My knees begin to feel warm now. Oh, pray have
mercy on me, good Mr. Osage!â€ cried Joe, before the flame was as large
as his hand, and yet full three feet distant from him. The greater
portion of the fagots being green, the fire made very slow progress,
and it was necessary for the savages to procure a constant supply of
dry splinters to prevent it from going out.

At length, after the combustible material had burned out, and been
replenished several times, the more substantial billets of Joeâ€™s pile
began to ignite slowly, and the old Indian then took up a flaming brand
and moved towards Sneak.

â€œCome on! you snarvilerous rattlesnake you, Iâ€™ll show you sights
presently!â€ said Sneak.

â€œYou brave fellowâ€”me burn you _quick_,â€ said the savage, applying the
torch, and, stooping down, placed his face within a few inches of the
crackling blaze, and began to blow it gently. Sneak twisted his head
round the tree as far as possible, and the next moment the powder
exploded, throwing down the pile of wood, and dashing the savage
several paces distant violently on the ground, and blackening and
scorching his face and hair in a terrible manner. The other Indians
instantly prostrated themselves on their faces, and uttered the most
doleful lamentations. Thus they remained a few minutes, evidently
impressed with the belief that the Great Spirit had interfered to
prevent the destruction of the prisoners. Hastily gathering up their
arms, they fled precipitately in the direction of their distant home,
and their yells of disappointment and defeat rang in the ears of their
captives until they died away in the distance.

â€œSneak! make haste! they may come back again!â€ said Joe.

â€œTheyâ€™ve tied my feet so tight Iâ€™m afraid I canâ€™t undo it in a hurry,â€
replied Sneak, endeavouring to break the cord by thrusting a stick
(that he had slipped from the pile to knock out the brains of one of
the Indians should his gun-powder plot not succeed,) between it and the
tree, and forcing it out until the pain produced became insufferable.
By this means the cord was loosened gradually, and moving it a little
higher up where the muscles had not yet been bruised, he repeated the
process. In this manner he laboured with certain but tardy success. But
while he was thus engaged, Joeâ€™s predicament became each moment more
critical. The wood being by this time pretty well seasoned, began to
burn more freely. The blaze was making formidable advances, and the
heat was becoming intolerable.

â€œFor heavenâ€™s sake, Sneak!â€ cried Joe, â€œmake haste and come here, or
Iâ€™ll be roasted alive!â€

â€œWait till I get away from my own tree,â€ replied Sneak.

â€œOh Lord! I canâ€™t wait a minute more! My shins are getting blistered!â€
cried Joe, writhing under the heat of the blaze, which now reached
within a few inches of him, and increased in magnitude with awful
rapidity.

â€œWell, if you wonâ€™t wait till I git there, just go ahead yourself,â€
said Sneak, at last extricating his feet by a violent effort, and
hopping to Joeâ€™s assistance, with some difficulty, for his nether limbs
were considerably bruised.

â€œHang it, Sneak, pull these burning sticks away from my knees!â€ said
Joe, his face flushed with pain.

â€œIâ€™ll be bursted with powder, if you didnâ€™t like to git into a purty
tight fix,â€ said Sneak, dashing down the consuming billets of wood.

â€œNow, Sneak, cut me loose, and then letâ€™s run home as soon as
possible.â€

â€œI hainâ€™t got my knife with me, or I wouldnâ€™t â€™ave been so long gitting
loose myself,â€ said Sneak, slowly untying Joeâ€™s hands.

â€œMy goodness, how my arms ache!â€ said Joe, when his hands were
released. â€œNow, Sneak, undo my feet, and then weâ€™ll be off in a hurry.â€

â€œIâ€™ll be slit if your feet ainâ€™t tied like mine was, in rich a hard
knot that no mortal being can git it undone. Iâ€™ll take a chunk, and
burn the tarnation string in two,â€ said Sneak, applying the fire.

â€œTake care you donâ€™t burn _me_,â€ said Joe, looking at the operation
with much concern.

Sneakâ€™s plan of severing his companionâ€™s bonds was successful. Joe
sprang in delight from his place of confinement, and, without uttering
another word, or pausing a single moment, the liberated companions
retreated from grove with all possible expedition.




CHAPTER XV.

Glennâ€™s History.


The young chief, or rather the restored youth, awoke in a few days from
the delirium into which the fever had plunged him, to a state of
convalescence and a consciousness of his altered condition. He now
uttered with earnest tenderness the endearing terms of â€œsisterâ€ and
â€œfather,â€ when he addressed Mary and Roughgrove. He spoke freely of the
many things he had witnessed while living with the Indians, expressing
his abhorrence of their habits and nature, and declared it was his
intention never to have any further intercourse with them. He promised,
when he should be able to leave his bed, to read and study with Mary
and Glenn, until he had made amends for the neglect of his education.
These symptoms, and the tractable disposition accompanying them, caused
Mary and Roughgrove to rejoice over the return of the long-lost youth,
and to bow in humble thankfulness to the Disposer of events for the
singular and providential circumstances attending his restoration.

Joe had arrived in due course of time, (which was brief,) after his
almost miraculous escape from the savages and the flames, and told his
story with various embellishments. The Indians were hunted the next day
by Sneak and a few of the neighbours, but they had doubtless abandoned
the settlement, for no traces of them remained after their mysterious
flight from the grove.

A few mild days, during which frequent showers had fallen, had in a
great measure removed the snow from the earth. And Joe having soon
forgotten his late perilous adventure, amused himself with the horses.
He resolved to make some amends for their long confinement in the
stable, and to effect it he galloped them several hours each day over
the grounds in the vicinity. The hounds, too, seemed delighted to place
their feet once more on the bare earth, and they were permitted to
accompany the horses in all their excursions.

One night, when William, Mary, and Joe were all quietly sleeping,
Roughgrove took occasion to express his gratitude to Glenn for the many
and important services rendered his family.

â€œWhatever good may have attended my efforts,â€ said Glenn, â€œyou may rest
assured that I have been amply repaid in the satisfaction enjoyed
myself.â€

â€œI am sure of it!â€ exclaimed Roughgrove; â€œand it was a conviction that
you harboured such sentiments that induced me to confide in you, and to
disclose things which I intended should remain for ever locked within
my own breast.â€

â€œYour confidence shall not be abused,â€ said Glenn; and to prove that I
am not averse to an exchange of secrets, if you will listen to my
recital, I will endeavour briefly to give you a sketch of _my_
history.â€

â€œI will listen attentively, my young friend, even were it as sad a tale
as mine, which can hardly be the case,â€ said Roughgrove, drawing his
chair close to Glennâ€™s side, and placing more fuel on the fire.

â€œWould to Heaven it had not been!â€ said Glenn, after reclining his head
on his hands a few minutes, and recalling transactions which he could
have wished to be blotted from his memory for ever. â€œI am a native of
New York,â€ he continued, heaving a sigh and folding his arms, â€œand was
left an orphan at a very early age. My father was once reputed one of
the wealthiest merchants in Broadway; but repeated and enormous losses,
necessarily inexplicable to one of my age, suddenly reduced him to
comparative poverty. Neither he nor my mother survived the blow many
months, and before I was ten years old, I was left (with the exception
of an uncle in Philadelphia) alone in the world, possessed of only a
few hundred dollars. My uncle placed me with an eminent physician, who
had been my fatherâ€™s friend, after my education was completed. He told
me that he was rich, and would see that I should not suffer for means
until I had acquired a profession, which, with energy and diligence,
would enable me to procure an honourable support. But he informed me
that he had a family of his own, and that I must not depend upon his
assistance further than to accomplish a profession.

â€œIt was during my studies, and when about seventeen years old, that my
misfortunes began. My preceptor had another student, named Henry Wold,
several years my senior, whose parents were wealthy. Wold and I
entertained the highest esteem for each other. But our circumstances
being different, I could not indulge in all the excesses of
extravagance that he did, but made better progress in my studies. He
attended all the gay parties and fashionable places of amusement, while
I seldom spent an evening from home. He was tall, manly, and possessed
of regular and beautiful featuresâ€”these, with his unlimited wealth,
made him a welcome guest in every circle, and extremely popular with
the ladies.

â€œOne Sabbath morning, while sitting in church, (which I attended
regularly,) I was struck with the appearance of a stranger in an
opposite pew across the aisle that belonged to a family with whom I was
on the most intimate terms. The stranger was the most beautiful young
lady I ever beheld. Dark, languishing eyes, glossy ringlets, pale,
smooth foreheadâ€”oh! I will not describe herâ€”let it suffice that she was
an angel in my eyes! It was impossible to remove my gaze from her, and
I fancied that she sometimes returned an approving glance. Before the
service was over, I was delighted to observe that she whispered
something to Mrs. Arras, (the name of the lady whose pew she was in,)
for this assured me that they were acquainted, and that I might obtain
some information about the fair being who had made such a sudden and
deep impression on my heart, and perhaps procure an introduction to
her. When I retired to my couch that night, it was not to sleep. The
image of the fair stranger haunted my restless and imperfect slumbers.
Nor could I study by day, for my thoughts wandered continually from the
page to the same bright vision. Such was my condition throughout the
week. The next Sunday I found her seated in the same pew. Our eyes met,
and a slight blush that mantled her fair face encouraged me to hope
that she might likewise have bestowed some thoughts on me during the
preceding week. It was in vain that I uttered the responses during the
service, or knelt down when the clergyman offered up his prayers. I
could think of nothing but the angelic stranger. I resolved that
another week should not pass without my calling at Mrs. Arrasâ€™s. But my
object was obtained sooner than I expected. When the congregation was
dismissed, Mrs. Arras beckoned me across the aisle to her.

â€œâ€˜Charles,â€™ whispered she, â€˜donâ€™t you want an introduction to my niece?
I saw your eyes riveted on her several times.â€™

â€œâ€˜Iâ€”if you please,â€™ I replied, with feelings of mingled delight and
embarrassment.

â€œâ€˜Laura,â€™ she continued, turning to the young lady who lingered behind,
but seemed to be conscious of what was passing, â€˜let me introduce you
to my young friend, Charles Glenn.â€™ The bland and accomplished Mrs.
Arras then moved onward, while I attended at the side of Laura, and
continued with her until I assisted her up, the marble steps of her
auntâ€™s stately mansion.

â€œI then bowed, and strode rapidly onward, I knew not whither,
(completely bewildered with the enchanting spell that the fair Laura
had thrown over me,) until I reached the extremity of Broadway, and
found myself in Castle Garden, gazing like a very maniac at the bright
water below me. I wandered about alone, enjoying the exhilarating
fancies of my teeming brain, until the sun sunk beneath the horizon,
and the bright stars twinkled in the blue vault above. Oh! the
thoughts, the hopes, the bliss of that hour! The dark curtain that
veils the rankling corruptions of mortality had not yet been lifted
before my staring eyes, and I felt as one gazing at a beautiful world,
and regarded the fair maid as the angel destined to unfold all its
brilliance to my vision, and to hold the chalice to my lips while I
sipped the nectar of perennial felicity. Alas, that such moments are
brief! They fly like the dreams of a startled slumberer, and when they
vanish once, they are gone forever!

â€œWithout calling at my lodgings for the usual refreshments, I hovered
about the mansion of Mrs. Arras till lights were gleaming in the
parlour, and then entered. Laura received me with a smile, and the
complaisant matron gave me an encouraging welcome.

â€œâ€˜You are pale this evening, Mr. Glenn,â€™ said Mrs. Arras, in a
good-humoured, though bantering manner. â€˜Are you subject to sudden
attacks of illness?â€™

â€œâ€˜I assure you I never enjoyed better health in my life, and feel no
symptoms of indisposition whatever,â€™ I replied, but at that moment I
chanced to gaze at a mirror, and was startled at my haggard appearance.
But when Mrs. Arras withdrew, (which she did soon after my arrival,)
the affable and lovely Laura banished every thought of my condition. My
wan cheek was soon animated with the flush of unbounded admiration, and
my sunken eye sparkled with the effervescence of enraptured delight.
Deep and ineradicable passion was engendering in my bosom. And from the
pleasure indicated in the glitter of Lauraâ€™s lustrous eyes, the
exquisite smile that dwelt upon her coral lips, and the gentle though
unconscious swellings of her breast, a conviction thrilled through my
soul that my sudden affection was reciprocated. Hours flew like
minutes, and I was surprised by the clock striking ONE before it
occurred to me that it was time to depart. Again I traversed the
streets at that solemn hour, insensible to every feeling, and
regardless of every object but the flaming torch lit up in my heart and
the seraphic image of Laura. At length I was warned by the scrutinizing
gaze of a watchman to repair to my lodgings. But my pillow afforded no
rest. All night long I pondered on the exhilarating events of the day.
Many were the endearing accents that escaped my lips as I addressed in
fancy my beloved Laura. I resolved to declare my passion ere many weeks
should pass. I began to settle in my mind the plans of life, and then,
for the first time, the future presented a dark spot to my view. I was
poor! Laura was rich and her family proud and aristocratic. Her father
was a distinguished judge. And the most high-born and haughty of the
land would doubtless (if they had not already) sigh at her feet! I
sprang upright on my couch when this discordant thought passed across
my mind. But the next moment I was consoled with the belief that I
already possessed her heart. And with a determination to have her, in
spite of every obstacle, should this be the case, I sank back through
weariness, and was soon steeped in deep, though unquiet slumber.

â€œThe two next succeeding Sundays I attended Laura to church. The
evenings of both days, and nearly all the intervening ones, I was with
her at the mansion of Mrs. Arras. But the evening of the last Sunday
was to me a memorable one. That evening I opened all my heart to Laura,
and found that every pulsation met a responding throb in hersâ€”such, at
least, I believed to be the caseâ€”and so she asserted. During the short
time she remained in New York, I was her accredited lover, and ever,
when together, the attachment she manifested was as ardent as mine.
Indeed, at times, her passion seemed unbounded, and I was more than
once tempted to propose a clandestine and immediate union. I was the
more inclined to this, inasmuch as her father (who had now returned
from a trip to Washington) began to regard my visits with displeasure.
But he soon passed on to Boston to attend to the duties of his office,
and again I had unrestrained access to Laura. But I am dwelling too
long on this part of my story.

â€œOne day Henry Wold, my fellow-student, inquired the cause of the
palpable change in my bearing and disposition. Would that my lips had
been sealed to him forever! I knew that he was honest and generous by
nature, but I knew not to what extent his dissolute habits (gradually
acquired by having ample means, and yielding by degrees to the
temptations of vice) had perverted his good qualities. I told him of my
love, and while describing the charms of Laura, I was pleased to
attribute the interest he evinced at the recital to his disinterested
friendship for me, without the thought that _he_ could be captivated
himself with the bare description. He begged me to introduce him. This,
too, gratified my pride, for I knew he would admire her. The perfect
form, rare beauty, intelligence, and wealth of Wold did not startle an
apprehension in my breast. But I knew notâ€”alas! who can know?â€”the
impulses that govern woman. Wold accompanied me that night to Mrs.
Arrasâ€™s. He seated himself at Lauraâ€™s side, and poured forth a flood of
flattery. They smiled in unison and returned glance for glance. Wold
exhibited his fine person and exerted all his captivating powers of
intellect. Laura scanned the one and listened attentively to the other.
Still I sat by in satisfaction, and strove to repress every rising fear
that my supremacy in Lauraâ€™s heart might be endangered. That evening,
as we returned homeward, in answer to my questions, Wold stated that my
â€˜intendedâ€™ was _pretty enough_ for any young man, and would, without
doubt, make a _very good wife_. So far from exhibiting the extravagant
admiration I expected, he seemed to speak of the object of my adoration
with comparative indifference. But a few evenings afterwards, I found
him with Laura when I arrived! I started back on beholding them seated
on the same sofa as I entered the parlour. Mrs. Arras was present, and
wore a thoughtful expression of features. Laura smiled on me, but I
thought it was not a happy smile. It did not render me happy. Wold
bowed familiarly, and made some witty remark about taking time by the
forelock. I sat down in silence, with a compressed lip, and an icy
chillness in my breast. An embarrassing pause ensued. At length Mrs.
Arras rose, and opening a folding-door, beckoned me into the adjoining
room. After we had been seated a few moments, during which her brow
assumed a more grave and thoughtful cast, she observedâ€”

â€œâ€˜You seem to be excited to-night, Charles.â€™

â€œâ€˜I have cause to be so,â€™ I replied.

â€œâ€˜I cannot deny it,â€™ said she, â€˜when I consider every thing that has
transpired. You doubtless have an attachment for Lauraâ€”I have _seen_
itâ€”and I confess it was and _would_ be with my goodwill had I control
of the matter. I was acquainted with your family, and acted with the
best of motives when I permitted, perhaps encouraged, the intimacy. But
I thought not of the austere and passionate nature of my
brother-in-law. Neither did I think that any man could object to your
addresses to his daughter. But I was mistaken. Judge ____ has written
that your interviews with Laura must terminate.â€™

â€œâ€˜Has he given any reason why?â€™ I asked, in tremulous tones.

â€œâ€˜Yes,â€™ she replied, â€˜but such as mortify me as much as they must pain
you. He says that your fortune and family connections are not
sufficient to permit the alliance. Oh, I implore you not to suppose
these to be my sentiments. I know your family is devoid of ignoble
stain, and that your fortune was once second to none. Had I the
disposal of Lauraâ€™s hand it should be yours!â€™

â€œâ€˜I believe it, Mrs. Arras!â€™ said I. â€˜But do you net think these
objections of Judge ____ may be overcome?â€™

â€œâ€˜Alas, never!â€™ she replied; â€˜he is immovable when any thing of moment
is decided in his mind.â€™

â€œâ€˜But,â€™ I continued, while the pulsations of my heart were distinctly
audible, â€˜what says Laura?â€™

â€œâ€˜Would I had been spared this question! You saw her a few minutes
since. HE who sees all things knows how my heart ached while I sat by.
I can only tell you she had just finished reading her fatherâ€™s letter
when Mr. Wold was announced. Spare me, now, I beseech you!â€™ I folded my
arms and gazed, I know not how long, at the flame ascending from the
hearth. Oh! the agony described of the dying were bliss to that moment.
What could I think or do? I sat like one whose heart has been rudely
torn from his breast, and who was yet debarred the relief of death.
Existence to me at that moment was a hell, and my sufferings were those
of the damned! I thank God I have survived them.

â€œI was aroused from my lethargy by hearing the street door close after
Wold, and I desired Mrs. Arras to permit me to have an interview with
Laura alone. It was granted, and I was soon in the presence of the
lovely maid. She was aware of my perturbation and its cause. She sat
with her eyes cast down in silence. I looked upon her form and her
features of perfect beauty, and oh! what tongue can describe the
mingled and contending emotions that convulsed my breast! I repressed
every violent or boisterous inclination of my spirits, however, and
taking her unresisting hand, sat down in sorrow at her side.

â€œâ€˜Laura,â€™ said I, with difficulty finding utterance, â€˜do we thus part,
and for ever?â€™ She made no answer, but gazed steadfastly at the rich
carpet, while her face, though somewhat paler than usual, betrayed no
change of muscle.

â€œâ€˜Laura,â€™ I repeated, in tones more distinct, â€˜are we _now_ to part,
and _for ever_?â€™

â€œâ€˜Father says so,â€™ she replied. Her hand fell from my grasp. The
unmoved, _indifferent_ manner of her reply froze my blood in my veins!
I again stared at her composed features in astonishment allied to
contempt.

â€œâ€˜But what do _you_ say?â€™ I asked, with a bluntness that startled her.

â€œâ€˜Father knows best, perhaps!â€™ she replied, turning her eyes to mine, I
thought, with calmness.

â€œâ€˜Laura,â€™ said I, again taking her hand, for I was once more subdued by
her beauty, â€˜I love you with my whole soul, and must continue to love
you. Ay, were you even to spurn me with your foot, so indissolubly have
my affections grown to your image, that my bleeding heart would turn in
adoration to the smiter. And I fondly hoped and believed that the
passion was returnedâ€”indeed, I had your assurance of the fact; nay,
think not I design to reproach you. It were bootless, had I the heart
to do it. Be assured that were you not only cruel to me, but steeped in
crime and guilty of injustice to the whole human race, I would still be
your friend were all others to forsake you. Deem me never your foe, or
capable of ever becoming such. May heaven bless you! We partâ€”but, under
_any_ circumstances, should adverse fortune overtake you and I can be
of service, I beg you not to hesitate to apply to me. You will find me
still your friend. I will not attempt to reverse the decision which you
have made. However humiliating and poignant the thought may be that I
was unconsciously the means of introducing the _object_ that influenced
your decision, yet I will not murmur, neither will I become _his_
enemy, for your sake. I hope you will be happy. I pray that heaven may
incline your heart to be true and _constant_ to Wold.â€™

â€œâ€˜I hope so,â€™ said she in a low tone.

â€œâ€˜Laura,â€™ said I, rising, â€˜you confess, then, that Wold possesses your
love?â€™

â€œâ€˜Yes,â€™ said she; â€˜but I cannot help it!â€™

â€œâ€˜Farewell!â€™ said I, kissing her yielding hand, and turning
deliberately away, though with the sensation of one stunned by a
thunderbolt. I returned home, and threw myself like a loathsome carcass
upon my couch. I could not even think. My mind seemed like some
untenanted recess in the unfathomable depths below. Instantaneous
death, and even eternal perdition afterwards, could have presented no
new horrors then. It was haply the design of Providence that the
thought of self-destruction should not occur to me. With the means in
my reach, I would in all probability have rushed, uncalled and
unprepared, into the presence of an offended Creator.

â€œA fever and delirium, such as possessed the poor youth lying there,
ensued. Under the kind care of my preceptor, my malady abated in a few
weeks; and, as I recovered, a change took place in my sentiments
regarding the events that produced my illness. My pride rose up to my
relief, and I resolved to overcome the effects of my disappointment.
Yet my heart melted in tenderness when I recalled the blissful moments
I had known with Laura. But I determined to prosecute my plans of life
as if no such occurrence had transpired.

â€œA few days after bidding Laura adieu, she returned to Boston,
accompanied by Wold. Wold obtained his diploma while I was writhing
with disease. Even the loss of my degree was now borne with patience
and resignation. I forgave Wold, and implored him to make Laura happy.
He promised faithfully to do so when on the eve of setting out with
her. I did not desire to see her myself, but sent my forgiveness and
blessing.

â€œIn a few months my diploma was obtained, and I commenced the practice
under the most favourable circumstances. My late preceptor was now my
partner. Nearly a year elapsed before Wold returned to New York. But a
rumor preceded him which again opened all the fountains of bitterness
in my heart. It was said (and only two or three were possessed of the
secret) that he had betrayed and ruined the lovely Laura! I sought him,
to ascertain from his own lips if he had truly committed the act
imputed to him. I resolved to avenge her! But Wold avoided me. I could
not obtain his ear, and all my notes to him remained unanswered.
Despairing of getting an immediate answer from him, I repaired to Mrs.
Arras. Her house was in gloom and sorrow. When she appeared, my heart
sank within me to behold her sad and mournful brow. She pressed my
extended hand, while a flood of tears gushed from her eyes.

â€œI knew by the disconsolate aspect of the aunt that the niece had been
dragged down from her high estate of virtue, fortune, and fame. I sat
down, and bowed my head in sorrow many minutes before the first word
was spoken. I still loved Laura. What could I say? how begin?

â€œâ€˜It is true!â€™ I at length exclaimed, rising up, and pacing the floor
rapidly, while many a tear ran down my cheek.

â€œâ€˜Alas! it is too true,â€™ iterated Mrs. Arras.

â€œâ€˜The black-hearted villain!â€™ I continued.

â€œâ€˜Ah, Mr. Glenn, her fate would have been different, if your addresses
had not been so cruelly spurned! God knows I was not to blame!â€™ said
she.

â€œâ€˜No, Mrs. Arras,â€™ said I; â€˜had your will been done, I had not been
made miserable by the bereavement, nor the beautiful, the
innocentâ€”theâ€”Laura, with all her errors, dishonoured, ruined, crushed!
But the betrayer, the viper that stung her, still breathes. I loved
herâ€”I love her yetâ€”and I will be her avenger!â€™ Saying this, I rushed
away, heedless of the matronâ€™s half-uttered entreaties to remain and to
desist from my plan of vengeance.

â€œThere was a young student of my acquaintance, a brave, chivalrous,
noble Virginian, to whom I imparted Lauraâ€™s sad story. He frankly
agreed with me that the venomous reptile in the human shape that could
beguile an unsuspecting and lovely girl to minister to his unhallowed
desires, and then, without hesitation or remorse, abandon her to the
dark, despairing shades of a frowning world, while he crawled on to
insinuate his poison into the breasts of new victims, should be
pursued, hunted down, and exterminated. Yet there was but one way for
me to punish Wold. The ignominy of the act, and the indignation of a
virtuous community were to him matters of indifference. The circle in
which he moved would smile at the misfortune of his victim, and applaud
his address, were the affair published. I resolved that he should
answer it to me alone. I had sworn in my heart to be Lauraâ€™s avenger.

â€œI penned a message which was delivered by my young Virginian friend in
person. Wold said he had no quarrel with me, and strove to evade the
subject. He sent me a note, demanding wherein he had ever wronged me,
and stating that he was ready and willing to _explain_ any thing that
might have offended me. I returned his note, with a line on the same
sheet, informing him that I was the friend of Laura; and that he must
either meet me in the manner indicated in my message, or I would
publicly brand him as a dastardly scoundrel. He bit his lip, and
referred my friend to one of his companions in iniquity, a Mr. Knabb,
who lived by the _profession_ of cards and dice. It was arranged that
we should meet on one of the islands near the city, and that it should
be the next morning. This was what I desired, and I had urged my friend
to effect as speedy a consummation of the affair as possible. All the
tumult and perturbation that raged in my bosom on parting with Laura
had returned, and the throbbing of my brain was almost insufferable. It
was with difficulty that my young friend prevailed upon me to embrace
the few intermediate hours before the meeting to practice with the
pistol. I heeded not his declaration that Wold was an excellent shot,
because I felt convinced that justice was on my side. I thought that
the criminal must inevitably fall. However, I consented to practice a
little to quiet his importunity. Truly, it seemed that his urgent
solicitation was reasonable enough, for the first fire my ball was
several feet wide of the mark. I had never fired a pistol before in my
life. But there was no quivering of nerve, no misgiving as to my fate;
for notwithstanding I was aware of being a novice, yet I entertained a
conviction, a presentiment, that the destroyer of my Lauraâ€™s innocence
would fall beneath my hand. The next fire I did better, and soon
learned to strike the centre.

â€œWe were all on the ground at the hour appointed. While the seconds
were arranging the necessary preliminaries, Wold, finding that my eyes
rested steadily upon him, endeavoured to intimidate me. There was a
bush some thirty paces distant, from which a slim, solitary sprout ran
up several feet above the rest of the branches. He gazed an instant at
it while I was marking him, and then raised his pistol, and fired in
the direction. The sprout fell. Turning, his eyes met mine, while a
slight smile was visible on his lip. The effect did not realize his
hopes. I looked upon the act with such cold indifference that he at
first betrayed surprise at my calmness, and then exhibited palpable
signs of trepidation himself. He beckoned Knabb to him, and, after a
brief conference in a low tone, his second returned to my friend, and
inquired if no amends, no reconciliation, could avert the exchange of
shots. My friend reported his words to me, and my reply was that
nothing but the restitution of the maidenâ€™s honourâ€”instant
marriageâ€”would be satisfaction. Wold protestedâ€”marriage was utterly
impossible under existing circumstancesâ€”but he would do any thing else.
But nothing else would answer; and I insisted on proceeding to business
without further delay. Wold heard me, and became pale. When we were
placed at our respective stations, and while the final arrangements
were being adjusted, I thought his replies to his friendâ€™s observations
betrayed much alarm. But there was no retreat. I was never calmer in my
life, I even smiled when my careful friend told me that he had detected
and prevented a concerted plan that would have given Wold the
advantage. The word was given. Woldâ€™s ball struck the earth before me,
and threw some sand in my face. Mine entered the seducerâ€™s side! I saw
him gasp, reel, and fall, while the blood gushed out on the beach. My
friend hurried me away, and paused not until he had placed me in a
stage just starting for Philadelphia. I clasped his hand in silence,
and the next moment the horses plunged away at the crack of the
driverâ€™s whip, and we were soon far on the road. Reflection ere long
convinced me that I had been guilty of an unjustifiable act. If it was
no crime in the estimation of men, it was certainly a grievous
transgression in the eyes of God! I then trembled. The bleeding form
and reproachful stare of Wold haunted my vision when the darkness set
in. Oh, the errors, in act and deed, of an impetuous youth thrown upon
the world with no considerate friend to advise him! The pity I felt for
Laura was soon forgotten in the horrible thought that I was a MURDERER!
Oh, the anguish of that night! Why did I not leave Wold to the judgment
of an offended God? Why did I not permit him to suffer the gnawing of
the canker that must ever abide in his heart, instead of staining my
hands with his blood? Freely would I have abandoned every hope of
pleasure in the world to have washed his blood away!

[Illustration: â€œI saw him gasp, reel, and fall.â€]


â€œWhen I arrived in Philadelphia, with a heavy heart, I sought a quiet
hotel, not daring to confront my uncle with such a tale of woe and
crime. For several days I remained in my chamber without seeing any one
but the servant that brought my food. At length I asked for a New York
paper. For more than an hour after it was brought I could not summon
courage to peruse the hated tragedy. Finally I snatched up the sheet
convulsively and glanced along the columns. When my eyes rested upon
the paragraph I was in quest of, I sprang to my feet in ecstasy. The
wound had not been fatal! Wold still lived!

â€œIn a twinkling I was dressed and on my way to my uncleâ€™s residence.
Notwithstanding there was a dreadful epidemic in the city, and hearses
and mourners were passing every few minutes, I felt within a buoyancy
that defied the terrors of disease and death.

â€œBut it seemed that disaster and desolation were fated to attend me
whithersoever I turned. A gloom brooded upon my heart when I approached
my uncleâ€™s mansion, and found the badge of mourning at the door. I
paused and asked the servant who was dead. He informed me that my uncle
alone remained. His wife and children, all had been consigned to the
tomb the day before, and he himself now lay writhing with the fell
disease. I rushed in and entered the sick chamber. It was the chamber
of death. My uncle pressed my hand and died. I followed him to the
grave, the chief and almost only mourner.

â€œI returned and shut myself up in the mansion, bewildered and
stupefied. I was now the possessor of immense wealth. But I was
unhappy. I knew not what to do to enjoy life. Gradually the pestilence
abated and disappeared, and by degrees the gloom that oppressed me
subsided. At the end of a few months, I was informed by my young
Virginian friend that Wold had entirely recovered. I likewise received
a letter from Mrs. Arras, stating that Judge ____ had sought out Laura,
(who had been enticed to an obscure part of the city,) and, as her
misfortune had been kept a profound secret among the few, he forgave
the offence, and once more extended to her a fatherâ€™s love and a
fatherâ€™s protection. I need not say that a blissful thrill bounded
through my veins. Wold was living, and Laura not irrecoverably lost.
Yet I did not then deem it possible that I could, under such
circumstances, ever desire to possess the once adored, but since truly
fallen, Laura. But I experienced a sweet gratification to be thus
informed of the prospect of her being reinstated in society. My love
was not yet wholly extinguished!

â€œWhen it was generally known that I possessed great riches, a crowd of
flatterers and sycophants hovered around me. I was a distinguished
guest at the mansions of the fashionable and great, and had in turn
many brilliant parties at my residence. But among the tinsel and
glitter of the gay world I sought in vain for peace and happiness. Many
beautiful and bewitching belles lavished their sweetest smiles upon me,
but they could not re-ignite the smothered flame in my bosom. Wine
could only exhilarate for a moment, to be succeeded by a gnawing
nausea. Cards could only excite while I lost, to be succeeded by
irritability and disgust.

â€œThus my time was spent for twelve months, when I suddenly conceived
the resolution to seek a union with the ill-fated Laura,
notwithstanding all the obloquy the world might attach to the act. I
still loved her in spite of myself. I could not live in peace without
her, and I determined without delay to offer her my hand, heart, and
fortune. I set out for Boston, and on my arrival instantly proceeded to
the residence of Judge ____. Again my evil star was in the ascendant.
Desolation and death presided in Judge ____â€™s family. The ominous badge
of mourning greeted me at the threshold; Lauraâ€™s mother had just been
consigned, broken-hearted, to the cold grave. The venerable Judge bowed
his hoary head to the blows that Providence inflicted. He could not
speak to me. His reply to my offer in relation to his child was only a
flood of tears. He then retreated into his library and locked the door.
An aged domestic told me all. Laura had abandoned her parental roof,
and voluntarily entered one of those sinks of pollution that so much
degrade human nature! I stood upon an awful abyss. The whirlpools of
deceit, ingratitude, indifference, and calumny, howled around me, and
the dark floods of sensual corruption roared below. Turn whithersoever
I might (alas, I thought not of heaven!) gloom, discord, and misery
seemed to be my portion.

â€œI hurried back to Philadelphia, and strove to mitigate my grief in the
vortex of unrestrained dissipation. I lavished my gold on undeserving
and unthankful objects. I cared not for life, much less for fortune. I
was the victim of a frenzy that rendered me reckless, and bereft me of
calm meditation. My frantic laughter was heard at the gaming-table, and
my plaudits were boisterous at the theatre, but I was a stranger to
enjoyment. There was no pleasure for me. My brawling companions swore I
was the happiest and noblest being on earth. But I knew too well there
was not a more miserable fiend in hell.

â€œAt length disease fortunately arrested my demoniac career before my
wealth was expended. It was my good fortune to secure the services of a
distinguished and skillful physician. He was a benevolent and
universally esteemed _Quaker_. His attention was not only constant, but
soothing and parental. His earnest and tender tones often made me weep.
When I recovered, I resolved to amend my life. This _friend_ had
applied a healing balm to my aching heart. I determined to prosecute my
profession, and before a year elapsed my exertions began to be crowned
with success.

â€œI was a frequent attendant at the lectures, and on terms of the
closest intimacy with the professors. Indeed, I had a prospect of a
professorship myself. I devoted my attention particularly to the
anatomical department of my studies, which I preferred; and it was in
this department of the institution that I would probably be installed
in a few months. The gentleman who occupied that chair was about to
resign, and, being my friend, used his influence to procure my
election.

â€œMy medical friend invited me one evening to be present at a
dissection, which promised to be one of extreme interest. He described
the subject as one that had elicited the admiration of the class. He
said it was a female of perfect proportions, but who had recently been
an inmate of a brothel of the lowest description. She had, in a state
of beastly inebriation, fallen into the fire. Yet, with the exception
of a small but fatal orifice in the side, her form and features
remained unaltered. I consented to meet him at the hour appointed, and
made my arrangements accordingly.

â€œThat evening there were many more persons in the dissecting-room than
usual. I had now become much more cheerful, and enjoyed the frank
greetings of my many friends with a relish and an ardour that had
hitherto been unknown to me. Many flippant remarks and careless
observations were exchanged in relation to the business before us. We
had become accustomed to such scenes, and habit had rendered us callous
to the reflections and impressions generally produced when gazing upon
the cold lineaments of the dead. Dissection was an indispensable act.
It had been resorted to under the deliberate conviction that it was
necessary to the perfection of science, and in a great degree redounded
to the welfare and preservation of the living. To us the pale inanimate
limbs, and the attenuated, insensible bodies of the dead brought no
disagreeable sensations. We cut and sawed them with the same composed
indifference with which the sculptor hews the marble.

â€œâ€˜This is a beautiful subject we have to-night, Glenn,â€™ observed one of
my friends, as we approached the dead body. He then threw up the white
cloth, and exposed the corpse, the head being still obscured. A
breathless silence reigned, while all gazed at the lifeless form in
admiration. She was a perfect Venus! Not having been wasted and
shrivelled by disease, the symmetry of her lineaments was preserved in
all the exactness of life and health. Her bust was full, plump, and the
skin of the most exquisite whiteness, except where it had been marred
by the fire that caused her death. Her limbs surpassed any model I had
ever beheld, round and tapering, smooth and white as ivory. Her ankles
were most admirably turned, and her feet of the smallest dimensions.
Her handsome and gently swelling arms were covered with a slight gauze
of short, dark hair, through which the snowy whiteness of her skin was
displayed to greater advantage. Her hands were extremely delicate, and
indicated that she had been accustomed to ease and luxury.

â€œI was requested to open her breast and exhibit to the students the
formation and functions of the heart. She was lying on her back, on a
long narrow table, around which the students stood gazing at her fair
proportions. Some reflected in sorrow that so beautiful and lovely a
being should die and be conveyed to the dissecting-room; while others
joked and laughed in a light unfeeling manner. When about to make an
incision with the sharp glittering steel in my hand, for the first time
since I had graduated, I confessed that my nerves were too much
affected by the sight of the subject to proceed, and I begged my
friends to be patient a few minutes, during which I would doubtless
regain my accustomed composure.

â€œâ€˜What was her name?â€™ I inquired of the friend who had accosted me on
my entrance.

â€œâ€˜Havenâ€™t you heard?â€™ said he, smilingâ€”â€˜I thought you all knew her.
Nearly every person in the city has heard of her, for she was the most
celebrated and notorious â€œfallen angelâ€ in the cityâ€”celebrated for her
unrivalled beauty and many triumphs, and notorious for her heartless
deceit and reckless disregard of her own welfare. She has led captive
many an unguarded swain by a passing smile in the street, and then
unceremoniously deserted him to join some drunken and beastly party in
an obscure and degraded alley.â€™

â€œâ€˜Her nameâ€”what was her name?â€™ I again asked, once more taking up the
knife, my nerves sufficiently braced by the above recital.

â€œâ€˜Anne R____,â€™ he replied; â€˜I thought,â€™ he continued, â€˜no one could be
ignorant of her name, after hearing a description of her habits.â€™

â€œâ€˜_All_ of us,â€™ I continued, rallying, â€˜are not familiar with the
persons and names of the â€œfallen angelsâ€ about town. But let us look at
her face.â€™ Saying this, I endeavoured to lift the white cloth from her
head, but finding that the resurrectionist had tied a cord tightly
round the muslin enclosing her neck and head, I desisted.

â€œâ€˜Her face is in keeping with her body and limbs,â€™ said my merry
friend; â€˜she was a perfect beauty. I have seen her in Chestnut Street
every fair day for the last six months, until she got drunk and fell in
the fire.â€™

â€œI now proceeded to business, but my flesh quivered as my knife
penetrated the smooth fair breast of the subject. Soon the skin and the
flesh were removed, and the saw grated harshly as it severed the ribs.
When the heart was exposed, all bent forward instinctively, scanning it
minutely, and seemingly with a curiosity to ascertain if it differed
from those of others whose lives were different.

[Illustration: It was Laura, the loved, adored Laura!]


â€œWhen the operation was over, my anxiety to see her face returned.
After an ineffectual effort to untie the cord, I became impatient, and
seizing the knife that lay on the table, ripped open the muslin that
hid her features! My God! The knife dropped from my hand, and
penetrating the floor, quivered upright at my feet, while every member
of my body trembled in unison with it! I raised my hands with my
fingers spread out to the utmost tension. My mouth fell open, and my
eyes felt as if they were straining to leap from my head. _It was
Laura_â€”the loved, adored Lauraâ€”_my_ Laura! My friends heard me repeat
the name, and marked with surprise and concern my inexplicably
miserable condition. They gathered round me, and endeavoured to divert
my attention from the dead and now gory body. It was in vain. I heeded
not their words, but gazed steadfastly at the sad features of Laura,
with my hands still uplifted. I was speechless, deaf, and immovable. No
tear moistened my eyes, but burning thoughts rushed through my brain.
My heart was cold, cold. Ah, I remembered how I had loved her once! I
thought of the time when I was happy to bow down at her feet, and in
good faith attribute to her many of the pure qualities pertaining to
_risen_ angels. And this was her end! The beautiful and innocentâ€”the
loving and belovedâ€”the high born and wealthyâ€”the light and joy of fond
and indulgent parentsâ€”had been beguiled by the infernal tempter to make
one step aside from the straight and narrow-path of dutyâ€”and this was
the result! The sensitive and guileless girl became an incarnate fiend,
callous to every modest and virtuous impulseâ€”scorned by the honest and
good, and hating and undermining the redeeming principles of her
speciesâ€”rushing from the high station which her ancestors had arduously
laboured for generations to attain, and voluntarily taking up her abode
in the dens of squalid misery and indelible pollutionâ€”closing her eyes
to the might and majesty of a merciful God, beckoning her to his
eternal throne in heaven, and giving heed to the fatal devices of the
enemy of mankind, till she was dragged down, down to the innermost
depths of a raging and roaring hell! Such was the fate of Laura. Such
is the fate of thousands who willingly err, though it be ever so
slight, for the sake of enjoying an impious gratification. Poor Laura!
Oh, how I loved her! But it is bootless to think of her now.

â€œI was gently forced from the dissecting-room by my friends, and
conducted to my home in silenceâ€”in silence, because I had no words for
any one. I pressed their hands at the door of my mansion, and bowing,
they departed for their homes to muse over the incidents of the
evening. I entered my silent chamber, but not to rest. I threw open the
casement and gazed out at the genial rays of the moon. The dark green
leaves of the linden trees were motionless, and the silvery rays
struggling through them cast a checkered and faint tint of mingled
light and shade on the pavement beneath. The cool fresh air soothed my
throbbing temples. I sank back in my seat and gazed up at the
innumerable stars in the boundless sky. I thought the stellar host
glittered with unusual brilliance, as if there were a joyous and holy
revelry going on in heaven. My heart grew calm. I felt a conviction
that true happiness, and purity of thought and purpose were
inseparable. I knew that the contaminations of the world had overthrown
many a righteous resolve, and linked the noblest minded with infamy. I
thought of Laura. The seductions of the world had literally prostrated
an angel before my eyes. I determined to _leave_ the world, if not for
ever, at least as long as its temptations to err, in the remotest
degree, were liable to beset my path. I came hither.â€

When Glenn finished his narrative, Roughgrove rose in silence, and
producing a small Bible that he always carried about his person, read
in a low, but distinct and impressive tone, several passages which were
peculiarly applicable to the state of their feelings. Glenn then
approached the couch where William slumbered peacefully. A healthful
perspiration rested on his forehead, and a sweet smile played upon his
lips, indicating that his dreams were not among the savage scenes in
which he had so lately mingled. Mary, who had fallen asleep while
seated at his side, overcome with silent watching, yet rested with her
head on the same pillow, precisely in the same attitude she reclined
when Glenn began his recital. Roughgrove took her in his arms, and
placing her softy at her brotherâ€™s feet, bestowed a kiss upon her brow,
and retired with Glenn to rest.




CHAPTER XVI.

Balmy springâ€”Joeâ€™s curious dreamâ€”He prepares to catch a
fishâ€”Glennâ€”William and Maryâ€”Joeâ€™s sudden and strange
appearanceâ€”La-u-naâ€”The trembling fawnâ€”The fishing sportâ€”The ducking
frolicâ€”Sneak and the panther.


It was now the first week in May. Every vestige of winter had long
since disappeared, and the verdure of a rich soil and mild temperature
was fast enrobing the earth with the freshest and most pleasing of
colours. Instead of the dreary expanse of ice that had covered the
river, its waters now murmured musically by in the early mornâ€”its
curling eddies running along the sedgy shore, while the rising sun
slowly dissipated the floating mists; and the inspiring notes of all
the wild variety of birds, contributed to invest the scene with such
charms as the God of nature only can impart, and which may only be
fully enjoyed and justly appreciated by guileless and unsophisticated
mortals.

Glenn rambled forth, and, partaking the harmony that pervaded the
earth, air, and waters, his breast swelled with a blissful exultation
that can never be known amid the grating voices of contending men, or
experienced in crowded cities, where many confused sounds vibrate
harshly and distracting on the ear. He stood in his little garden among
the flowers that Mary had planted, and watched the humming-birds poised
among the trembling leaves, their tiny wings still unruffled by the
dew, while their slender beaks inhaled the sweet moisture of the
variegated blossoms. Long he regarded the enchanting scene, unconscious
of the flight of time, and alike regardless of the past and the future
in his all-absorbing admiration of the present, wherein he deemed he
was not far remote from that Presence to which time and eternity are
obedientâ€”when his phantasm was abruptly and unceremoniously put to
flight by his man Joe, who rushed out of the house with a long rod in
his hand; yawning and rubbing his eyes, as if he had been startled from
his morning slumber but a moment before.

â€œWhatâ€™s the matter?â€ demanded Glenn.

â€œIt was a wapper!â€ said Joe.

â€œWhat was?â€

â€œThe fish.â€

â€œWhere?â€ asked Glenn.

â€œIâ€™ll tell you. I dreamt I was sitting on a rock, down at the ferry,
with this rod in my hand, fishing for perch, when a thundering big
catfish, as long as I am, took hold. I dreamt he pulled and I
pulledâ€”sometimes he had me in the water up to my knees, and sometimes I
got him out on dry land. But he always flounced and kicked back again.
Yet he couldnâ€™t escape, because the hook was still in his mouth, and
when he jumped into the river I jumped to the rod, and so we had it
over and overâ€”â€

â€œAnd now have done with it,â€ said Glenn, interrupting him. â€œWhat are
you holding the rod now for?â€

â€œIâ€™m going to try to catch him,â€ said Joe, with unaffected simplicity.

â€œMerely because you had this dream!â€ continued Glenn, his features
relaxing into a smile.

â€œYesâ€”I believe in dreams,â€ said Joe. â€œOnce, when we were living in
Philadelphia, I had one of these same dreams. It was just about the
same hourâ€”â€

â€œHow do you know what hour it was you dreamt about the fish?â€ again
interrupted Glenn.

â€œWhyâ€”Iâ€”,â€ stammered Joe, â€œIâ€™m sure it was about daybreak, because the
sun rose a little while after I got out.â€

â€œThat might be the case,â€ said Glenn, â€œif you were to dream about the
same thing from sun-down till sun-up. And I believe the fish was
running in your head last night before I went to bed, for you were then
snoring and jerking your arms about.â€

â€œWell, Iâ€™ll tell you my other dream, anyhow. I dreamt I was walking
along Spruce Street wharf with my head down, when all at once my toe
struck against a red morocco pocket-wallet; I stooped down and picked
it up and put it in my pocket, and went home before I looked to see
what was in it.â€

â€œWell, what was in it when you did look?â€ asked Glenn.

â€œThere was a one thousand dollar note on the Bank of the United States,
with the presidentâ€™s and cashierâ€™s names on it, all genuine. Oh, I was
so happy! I put it in my vest-pocket and sewed it up.â€

â€œBut what have you done with it since?â€ asked Glenn.

â€œIâ€”Hang it! it was only a dream!â€[1]  said Joe, unconsciously feeling
in his empty pocket.

â€œBut what has that dream to do with the fish?â€ pursued Glenn.

â€œIâ€™ll tell you,â€ said Joe. â€œWhen I got up in the morning and discovered
it was a dream, I slipped on my clothes as quickly as possible and set
off for the wharf. When I got there, I walked along slowly with my head
down till at length my toe struck against an oyster-shell. I picked it
up, and while I was looking at it, the captain of a schooner invited me
on board of his vessel to look at his cargo of oysters, just stolen
from Deep Creek, Virginia. He gave me at least six dozen to eat!â€

â€œAnd this makes you have faith in such dreams?â€ asked Glenn, striving
in vain to repress his laughter.

â€œI got _something_ by the dream,â€ said Joe. â€œI had a first rate
oyster-breakfast.â€

â€œBut what has all this to do with the fish?â€ continued Glenn; â€œperhaps,
instead of the fish, you expect to catch a _frog_ this time. You will
still be an Irishman, Joe. Go and try your luck.â€

â€œSt. Patrick forbid that I should be any thing else but an Irishman! I
should like to know if an Irishman ainâ€™t as good as anybody else,
particularly when heâ€™s born in America, as I was? But the dream in
Philadelphia _did_ have something to do with a fish. Didnâ€™t I catch a
fish? Isnâ€™t an oyster a fish? And it had something to do with _this_
fish, too. Iâ€™ve been bothering my head ever since I got up about what
kind of _bait_ to catch him with, and Iâ€™m sure I never would have
thought of the right kind if you hadnâ€™t mentioned that _frog_ just now.
I recollect they say thatâ€™s the very best thing in the world to bait
with for a catfish. Iâ€™ll go straight to the brook and hunt up a frog!â€
Saying this, Joe set out to execute his purpose, while Glenn proceeded
to Roughgroveâ€™s house to see how William progressed in his studies.

The intelligent youth, under the guidance of Roughgrove, Glenn, and his
unwearying and affectionate sister, was now rapidly making amends for
the long neglect of his education while abiding with the unlettered
Indians. He had already gone through the English grammar, and was
entering the higher branches of study. The great poets of his own
country, and the most approved novelists were his companions during the
hours of relaxation; for when the illimitable fields of intellect were
opened to his vision, he would scarce for a moment consent to withdraw
his admiring gaze. Thus, when it was necessary for a season to cease
his toil in the path of learning, he delighted to recline in some cool
shade with a pleasing book in his hand, and regale his senses with the
flowers and refreshing streams of imaginative authors. And thus sweetly
glided his days. Could such halcyon moments last, it were worse than
madness to seek the wealth and honours of this world! In that secluded
retreat, though far from the land of his nativity, with no community
but the companionship of his three or four friends and the joyous
myriads of birdsâ€”no palaces but the eternal hills of nature, and no
pageantry but the rays of the rising and setting sun streaming in
prismatic dies upon them, the smiling youth was far happier than he
would have been in the princely halls of his fathers, where the
sycophant only bent the knee to receive a load of gold, and the friend
that might protect him on the throne would be the first to stab him on
the highway.

A spreading elm stood near the door of Roughgroveâ€™s house, and beneath
its clustering boughs William and Mary were seated on a rude bench,
entirely screened from the glaring light of the sun. A few paces
distant the brook glided in low murmurs between the green flags and
water violets over its pebbly bed. The morning dew yet rested on the
grass in the shade. The soft sigh of the fresh breeze, as it passed
through the motionless branches of the towering elm, could scarce be
heard, but yet sufficed ever and anon to lift aside the glossy ringlets
that hung pendent to the maidenâ€™s shoulders. The paroquet and the
thrush, the bluebird and goldfinch, fluttered among the thick foliage
and trilled their melodies in sweetest cadence. Both the brother and
sister wore a happy smile. Happy, because the innocence of angels dwelt
in the bosom of the one, and the memory of his guileless and blissful
days of childhood possessed the other. Occasionally they read some
passages in a book that lay open on Maryâ€™s lap, describing the last
days of Charles I., and then the bright smile would be dimmed for a
moment by a shade of sadness.

â€œOh! poor man!â€ exclaimed Mary, when William read of the axe of the
executioner descending on the neck of the prostrate monarch.

â€œIt is far better to dwell in peace in such a quiet and lonely place as
this, than to be where so many cruel men abide,â€ said William,
pondering.

â€œAh me! I did not think that Christian men could be so cruel,â€ said
Mary, a bright tear dropping from her long eyelash.

â€œBut the book says he was a tyrant and deserved to die,â€ continued the
youth, his lips compressed with firmness.

â€œHeâ€™s coming!â€ exclaimed Mary, suddenly, and the pitying thought of the
unfortunate Charles vanished from her mind. But as she steadily gazed
up the path a crimson flush suffused her smooth brow and cheek, and she
rose gracefully, and with a smile of delight, welcomed Glenn to the
cool and refreshing shade of the majestic elm.

â€œYou have come too late. William has already said his lesson, and Iâ€™m
sure he knew it perfectly,â€ said Mary, half-reproachfully and
half-playfully.

â€œMary donâ€™t know, Mr. Glenn; because I am now further advanced than she
is,â€ said William.

â€œBut what kept you away so long this beautiful morning?â€ continued the
innocent girl. â€œDonâ€™t you see the dew is almost dried away in the sun,
and the morning-glories are nearly all closed?â€

â€œI was lingering in the garden among the delicate flowers you gave me
Mary; and the green and golden humming-birds charmed me so that I could
not tear myself away,â€ replied our hero, as he sat down between the
brother and sister.

â€œI shall go with brother William on the cliff and get some wild roses
and hare-bells, and then all your humming-birds will leave you and stay
here with me,â€ said Mary, smiling archly.

â€œBut you will be the prettiest bird among them, and flower too, to my
eyes,â€ said Glenn, gazing at the clear and brilliant though laughing
eyes of the pleased girl.

â€œIf that were the case, why did you linger so long in the garden?â€
asked the maid, with some seriousness.

â€œI should not have done so, Mary, but for Joe, who, you know, will
always be heard when he has any thing to say; and this morning he had a
ludicrous dream to tell me.â€

â€œI like Joe a great dealâ€”he makes me laugh every time I see him. And
you must tell me what he said, and how he looked and acted, that I may
know whether you did right to stay away so long,â€ said the thoughtless
and happy girl, eager to listen to the accents of the one whose
approach had illumined her features with the mystical fires of the
heart.

Glenn faithfully repeated every word and gesture of his dialogue with
Joe, and the unsophisticated girlâ€™s joyous laugh rang merrily up the
echoing vale in sweet accompaniment with the carols of the feathered
songsters.

When the narration ended, they both turned with surprise to William,
who, instead of partaking their hilarity as usual, sat perfectly
motionless in deep thought, regarding with apparent intensity the
straggling spears of grass that grew at his feet. The book he had taken
up, which had dropped from Maryâ€™s lap when she hastily rose at the
approach of Glenn, now fell unobserved by him from his relaxed hand.
His face became unusually pale. His limbs seemed to be strangely
agitated, and the pulsations of his heart were audible.

â€œWhatâ€™s the matter, dear brother?â€ cried Mary, in alarm.

â€œLa-u-naâ€”LA-U-NA!â€ he exclaimed, and, sinking softly down on his knees,
applied his ear close to the ground in a listening attitude.

â€œDear brother William! _do_ tell Mary what ails you! What is La-u-na!â€
said the startled and distressed girl, with affectionate concern.

â€œ_La-u-na_â€”THE TREMBLING FAWN!â€ cried William, pantingly.

â€œListenâ€ said Glenn, checking Mary when she was about to repeat her
inquiry. A plaintive flute-like sound was heard at intervals, floating
on the balmy and almost motionless air down the green-fringed vale. At
times it resembled the mournful plaint of the lonely dove, and then
died away like the last notes of the expiring swan.

Before many minutes elapsed another sound of quite a different
character saluted their ears. This was a rustling among the bushes,
heard indistinctly at first, while the object was far up the valley,
but as it approached with fearful rapidity, the rushing noise became
tremendous, and a few moments after, when the trembling sumachs parted
in view, they beheld Joe! He dashed through the briers interspersed
among the undergrowth, and plunged through the winding brook that
occasionally crossed his path, as if all surrounding obstacles and
obstructions were contemptible in comparison with the danger behind!
Leaping over intervening rocks, and flying through dense clusters of
young trees that ever and anon threatened to impede his progress, he at
length reached the spot where the little group still remained seated.
Without hat or coat, and panting so violently that he was unable to
explain distinctly the cause of his alarm, poor Joe threw himself down
on the earth in the most distressed and pitiable condition.

â€œWhat have you seen? What is the cause of this affright?â€ asked Glenn.

â€œIâ€”ohâ€”theyâ€”coming!â€ cried Joe, incoherently.

â€œWhat is coming?â€ continued Glenn.

â€œIâ€”Indians!â€ exclaimed he, springing up and rushing into the house.

â€œThey are friendly Indians, then,â€ said Mary; â€œbecause the hostile ones
never come upon us at this season of the year.â€

â€œSo I have been told,â€ said Glenn; â€œbut even the sight of a friendly
Indian would scare Joe.â€

â€œIt is La-u-na!â€ said William, still attentively listening.

â€œWhat is _La-u-na_?â€ interrogated Mary, again.

â€œThe _Trembling Fawn_!â€ repeated William, with emphasis, in a
mysterious and abstracted manner. Presently he stood up and intently
regarded the dim path over-shadowed by the luxuriant foliage that Joe
had so recently traversed, and an animated smile played upon his lips,
and dark, clear eyes sparkled with a thrill of ecstasy.

A slight female form, emerged from the dark green thicket, and glided
more like a spirit of the air than a human being towards the wondering
group. Her light steps produced no sound. In each hand she held a rich
bouquet of fresh wild flowers, and leaves and blossoms were
fantastically, though tastefully, arranged in her hair and on her
breast. A broad, shining gold band decked her temples, but many of her
raven ringlets had escaped from their confinement, and floated out on
the wind as she sped towards her beloved.

â€œLa-u-na! La-u-na!â€ cried William, darting forward frantically and
catching the girl in his arms. He pressed her closely and fondly to his
heart, and she hid her face on his breast. Thus they clung together
several minutes in silence, when they were interrupted by Roughgrove,
whose attention had been attracted by the sudden affright of Joe.

â€œWilliam, my dear boy,â€ said the grieved old man, â€œyou must not have
any thing to do with the Indiansâ€”you promised us that you would notâ€”â€

â€œLeave us!â€ said the youth, sternly, and stamping impatiently.

â€œDo, father!â€ cried Mary, who looked on in tears, a few paces apart;
â€œbrother wonâ€™t leave us againâ€”Iâ€™m sure he wonâ€™tâ€”will you, William?â€

â€œNo, I will not!â€ exclaimed the youth. The Indian girl comprehended the
meaning of his words, and, tearing, away from his embrace, stood with
folded arms at his side, with her penetrating and reproachful eyes
fixed full upon him, while her lips quivered and her breast heaved in
agitation. All now regarded her in silence and admiration. Her form was
a perfect model of beauty. Her complexion was but a shade darker than
that of the maidens of Spain. Her brows were most admirably arched, and
her long silken lashes would have been envied by an Italian beauty. Her
forehead and cheeks were smooth, and all her features as regular as
those of a Venus. The mould of her face was strictly Grecian, and on
her delicate lips rested a half-formed expression of sad regret and
firm resolution. Her vestments were rich, and highly ornamented with
pearls and diamonds. She wore a light snowy mantle made of swan skins,
on which a portion of the fleecy down remained. Beneath, the dress was
composed of skins of the finest finish, descending midway between her
knees and ankles, where it was met by the tops of the buckskin
moccasins, that confined her small and delicately-formed feet. Her
arms, which were mostly concealed under her mantle, were bare from the
elbows down, and adorned at the wrists with silver bands.

â€œWhy, hang it all! Was there nothing running after me but this squaw?â€
asked Joe, who had ventured forth again unobserved, and now stood
beside Glenn and Mary.

â€œSilence!â€ said Glenn.

â€œOh, donâ€™t call _her_ a squaw, Joeâ€”sheâ€™s more like an angel than a
squaw,â€ said Mary, gazing tenderly at the lovers, while tears were yet
standing in her eyes.

â€œI wonâ€™t do so again,â€ said Joe, â€œbecause sheâ€™s the prettiest wild
thing I ever saw; and if Mr. William donâ€™t marry her, I will.â€

â€œKeep silent, Joe, or else leave us,â€ again interposed Glenn.

â€œIâ€™ll go catch my fish. I had just found a frog, and was in the act of
catching it, when I saw the sqâ€”theâ€”_her_â€”and I thought then that I
would just run home and let you know she was coming before I took it.
But I remember where it was, and Iâ€™ll have it now in less than no
time.â€ Saying this, Joe set off up the valley again, though not very
well pleased with himself for betraying so much alarm when there was so
little danger.

â€œLa-u-na, I am no Indian,â€ said William, at length, in the language of
her tribe, and much affected by her searching stare.

â€œBut you were once the young chief that led our warriors to battle, and
caught La-u-naâ€™s heart. I heard you were a pale-face after you were
taken away from us; and I thought if you would not fly back to La-u-na,
like the pigeon that escapes from the talons of the eagle and returns
to its mate, then I would lose youâ€”forget youâ€”hate you. I tried, but I
could not do it. When the white moon ran up to the top of the sky, and
shone down through the tall trees in my face, I would ever meet you in
the land of dreams, with the bright smile you used to have when you
were wont to put your arm around me and draw me so gently to your
breast. I was happy in those dreams. But they would not stay. The
night-hawk flew low and touched my eyes with his wings as he flapped
by, and I awoke. Then my breast was cold and my cheeks were wet. The
katydids gathered in the sweet rose-bushes about me and sung
mournfully. La-u-na was unhappy. La-u-na must see her Young Eagle, or
go to the land of spirits. She called her wild steed to her side, and,
plucking these flowers to test his fleetness, sprang upon him and flew
hither. He is now grazing in the prairie at the head of the valley; and
here are the blossoms, still alive, fresh and sweet.â€ The trembling and
tearful girl then gently and sadly strewed the flowers over the grass
at her feet.

â€œSweet La-u-na!â€ cried William, snatching up the blossoms and pressing
them to his lips, â€œforgive the young chief; he will still love you and
never leave you again.â€

â€œNoâ€”noâ€”no!â€ said the girl, shaking her head in despair; â€œthe pale face
youth will not creep through the silent and shady forest with La-u-na
any more. He will gather no more ripe grapes for the Trembling Fawn. He
will not bathe again in the clear waters with La-u-na. He will give her
no more rings of roses to put on her breast. The Trembling Fawn is
wounded. She must find a cool shade and lie down. The dove will perch
over her and wail. She will sing a low song. She will close her eyes
and die.â€

Oh, no! cried William, placing his arms around her tenderly.

â€œOh, no!â€ cried William, placing his arms around her tenderly; â€œLa-u-na
must not die; or, if she does, she shall not die alone. Why will not
La-u-na dwell with me, among my friends?â€ The girl started, and
exhibited signs of mingled delight and doubt.


â€œOh, no!â€ cried William, placing his arms around her tenderly, â€œLa-u-na
must not die, or if she does, she shall not die alone. Why will not
La-u-na dwell with me among my friends?â€ The girl started and exhibited
signs of mingled delight and doubt, and then repliedâ€”

â€œThe pale maiden would hate La-u-na, and the gray-head would drive her
away.â€

â€œNo, La-u-na,â€ said William; â€œthey would all love you, and we would be
so happy! Say you will stay with me here, and you shall be my wife, and
I will have no other love. My sister is sweet and mild as La-u-na, and
my father will always be kind.â€

The dark eyes of the girl assumed an unwonted lustre, and she turned
imploringly to Mary, Glenn, and Roughgrove.

â€œOh!â€ cried William, in his native tongue, addressing his white
friends; â€œlet La-u-na dwell with us! She is as innocent as the lily by
the brook, and as noble as a queen. Father,â€ he continued, stepping
forward and taking Roughgroveâ€™s hand, â€œyou wonâ€™t refuse my request! And
you, sister Mary, I know you will love her as dearly as you do me. And
you, my friend,â€ said he, turning to Glenn, â€œwill soon hear her speak
our own language, and she will cull many beautiful flowers for you that
the white man never yet beheld. Grant this,â€ added the youth, after
pausing a few moments, while his friends hung their heads in silence,
â€œand I will remain with you always; but if you refuse, I must fly to
the forest again.â€

â€œStay! Oh, brother, you shall not go!â€ cried Mary, and rushing forward,
she threw her arms round his neck. The Indian girl kissed her pale
brow, and smiled joyfully, when the youth told her that Mary was his
dear sister.

â€œHe loves her, and her affection for him is imperishable!â€ said Glenn.

â€œAnd why may they not be happy together, if they dwell with us?â€ asked
Roughgrove, pondering.

â€œThere is no reason why they should not be. Let us tell them to remain
and be happy,â€ said Glenn.

When fully informed that she might abide with them and still love her
Young Eagle, La-u-na was almost frantic with ecstasy. She looked
gratefully and fondly on her new friends, and pressed their hands in
turn. She seemed to be more especially fond of Mary, and repeatedly
wound her smooth and soft arms affectionately about her waist and neck.

William led his Indian bride to the seat under the spreading green
tree, and signified a desire to commune with her alone. When seated
together on the rude bench, the maidenâ€™s hand clasped in Williamâ€™s,
Mary fondly kissed them both and withdrew in company with Roughgrove
and Glenn. Roughgrove prostrated himself in prayer when within the
house. Mary ran up to the top of the beetling cliff to cull flowers,
and Glenn directed his steps down the valley towards the river, whither
Joe had preceded him with the frog he had succeeded in capturing.

Glenn was met about midway by Joe, who was returning slowly, with
peculiar marks of agitation on his face. He had neither frog, rod, nor
fish in his hand.

â€œI thought you were fishing,â€ remarked Glenn.

â€œSo I am,â€ replied Joe; â€œand Iâ€™ve had the greatest luck you ever heard
of.â€

â€œWell, tell me your success.â€

â€œI had a bite,â€ continued he, â€œin less than three minutes after I threw
in my hook. It was a wapper! When he took hold I let him play about
awhile with a slack line, to be certain and get it well fixed in his
mouth. But when I went to draw up, the monster made a splash or two,
and then whizzed out into the middle of the river!â€

â€œWhere was the hook?â€ asked Glenn.

â€œIn his mouth, to be sure,â€ replied Joe.

â€œAnd the line?â€

â€œFast to the rod.â€

â€œAnd the rod?â€

â€œFast to the line!â€ said Joe, â€œand following the fish at the rate of
ten knots, while I stood on the bank staring in utter astonishment.â€

â€œThen, where was your great success?â€ demanded Glenn.

â€œIt was a noble _bite_,â€ said Joe.

â€œBut you were the _bitten_ one,â€ remarked Glenn, scanning Joeâ€™s visage,
which began to assume a disconsolate cast.

â€œIf Iâ€™d only been thinking about such a wapper, and had been on my
guard,â€ said Joe, â€œsplash me if he should ever have got my rod away in
that mannerâ€”Iâ€™d have taken a ducking first!â€

â€œHave you no more lines?â€ asked Glenn.

â€œNo,â€ replied Joe, â€œnone but yourâ€™s.â€

â€œYou are welcome to itâ€”but be quick, and I will look on while you have
your revenge.â€

Joe sprang nimbly up the hill, and in a few minutes returned with fresh
tackle and another frog that he found on his way. They then repaired to
the margin of the river; but before Joe ventured to cast out his line
again he made the end of the rod fast to his wrist by means of a strong
cord he had provided for that purpose. But now his precaution seemed to
have been unnecessary, for many minutes elapsed without any symptoms of
success.

Glenn grew impatient and retired a few paces to the base of the cliff,
where he reclined in an easy posture on some huge rocks that had
tumbled down from a great height, and lay half-imbedded in the earth.
Here he long remained with his eyes fixed abstractedly on the curling
water, and meditated on the occurrence he had recently witnessed. While
his thoughts were dwelling on the singular affection and constancy of
the Indian girl, and the probable future happiness of her young lord,
his reflections more than once turned upon his _own_ condition. The
simple pleasantries that had so often occurred between Mary and himself
never failed to produce many unconscious smiles on his lips, and being
reciprocated and repeated day after day with increased delight, it was
no wonder that he found himself heaving tender sighs as he occasionally
pictured her happy features in his mindâ€™s eye. He now endeavoured to
bestow some grave consideration on the tender subject, and to think
seriously about the proper mode of conducting himself in future, when
he heard the innocent maidenâ€™s clear and inspiring voice ringing down
the valley and sinking in soft murmuring echoes on the gliding stream.
Soon his quick ear caught the words, which he recognised to be a short
ballad of his own composing, that had been written at Maryâ€™s request.
He then listened in silence, without moving from his recumbent
position.



THE CRUEL MAIDEN.

I.

She heard his prayer and sweetly smiled,
Then frownâ€™d, and laughing fled away;
But the poor youth, eâ€™en thus beguiled,
Still would pray.

II.

Heâ€™d won her heart, but still she fled,
And laughâ€™d and mockâ€™d from dell and peak
While his sad heart, that inward bled,
Was fit to break!

III.

Where the bright waters lead adown
The moss-green rocks and flags among,
He pausedâ€”and on his brow a frown
Darkly hung!

IV.

A shriek came down the peaceful vale,
Full soon the maid was at his side,
Her ringlets flowing, and cheeks all pale,
A _willing_ bride!


Glenn long remained motionless after the sounds died away, as if
endeavouring to retain the soothing effect of the ringing notes that
had so sweetly reverberated along the jutting peaks of the towering
cliff!

â€œIâ€™ve got a bite!â€ exclaimed Joe, bending over the verge of the bank
and stretching his arms as far as possible over the water, while his
line moved about in various directions, indicating truly that a fish
had taken the hook.

â€œHold fast to the rod this time, Joe,â€ remarked Glenn, who became
interested in the scene.

â€œWonâ€™t I? Its tied fast to my wrist.â€

â€œIs it not time to pull him up?â€ asked Glenn, seeing that the fish, so
far from being conscious of peril, inclined towards the shore with the
line in quest of more food.

â€œHere goes!â€ said Joe, jerking the rod up violently with both hands. No
sooner did the fish feel the piercing hook in his mouth than he rose to
the surface, and splashing the water several feet round in every
direction, darted quickly downwards, in spite of the strenuous efforts
of Joe to the contrary.

Nevertheless, Joe entertained no fears about the result; and the fish,
as if apprized of the impossibility of capturing the rod, ran along
parallel with the shore, gradually approaching the brink of the water,
and seemingly with the intention to surrender himself at the feet of
the piscator. But this was not his purpose. When Joe made another
strong pull, in the endeavour to strand him in the shallow water, the
fish again threw up the spray (some of which reached his adversaryâ€™s
face,) and, turning his head outwards, ran directly away from the
shore.

â€œPull him back, Joe!â€ said Glenn.

â€œI am trying with all my might,â€ replied Joe, â€œbut heâ€™s so plaguy
strong he wonâ€™t come, hang him!â€

â€œHeâ€™ll get away if you donâ€™t mind!â€ continued Glenn, evincing much
animation in his tones and gestures.

â€œIâ€™ll be drenched if he does!â€ said Joe, with his arm, to which the rod
was lashed, stretched out, while he endeavoured to plant his feet
firmly in the sand.

â€œHeâ€™ll have you in the waterâ€”cut the rod loose from your wrist!â€ cried
Glenn, as Joeâ€™s foothold gave way and he was truly drawn into the
water.

â€œOh, good gracious! Iâ€™ve got no knife! Give me your hand!â€ cried Joe,
vainly striving to untie the cord. â€œHelp me! Oh, St. Peter!â€ he
continued, imploringly, as the fish drew him on in the water, in quick
but reluctant strides. â€œOh! Iâ€™m gone!â€ he cried, when the water was
midway to his chin, and the fish pulling him along with increasing
rapidity.

â€œYou are a good swimmer, Joeâ€”be not alarmed, and you will not be hurt,â€
said Glenn, half inclined to laugh at his manâ€™s indescribable
contortions and grimaces, and apprehending no serious result.

â€œUgh!â€ cried Joe, the water now up to his chin, and the next moment,
when in the act of making a hasty and piteous entreaty, his head
quickly dipped under the turbid surface and disappeared entirely. Glenn
now became alarmed; but, when in the act of divesting himself of his
clothing for the purpose of plunging in to his rescue, Joe rose again
some forty paces out in the current, and by the exertion of the arm
that was free he was enabled to keep his head above the water. The
current was very strong, and the fish, in endeavouring; to run up the
stream with his prize in tow, made but little headway, and a very few
minutes sufficed to prove that it was altogether unequal to the
attempt. After having progressed about six rods, Joeâ€™s head became
quite stationary like a buoy, or a cork at anchor, and then, by
degrees, was carried downward by the strong flow as the fish at length
became quite exhausted.

â€œNow for it, Joeâ€”swim towards the shore with him!â€ cried Glenn.

â€œHeâ€™s almost got my shoulder out of place!â€ replied Joe, blowing a
large quantity of water out of his mouth.

â€œI see his fin above the water,â€ said Glenn; â€œstruggle manfully, Joe,
and you will capture him yet!â€

â€œIâ€™ll die but Iâ€™ll have him nowâ€”after such a ducking as this!â€ said
Joe, approaching the shore with the almost inanimate fish, that was no
longer able to contend against his superior strength. When he drew near
enough to touch the bottom, he turned his head and beheld his prize
floating close behind, and obedient to his will.

It required the strength of both Glenn and Joe to drag the immense
catfish (for such it proved to be) from its native element. It was
about the length and weight of Joe, and had a mouth of sufficient
dimensions to have swallowed a manâ€™s head. It was given to the
ferrymen, who had witnessed the immersion, and were attracted thither
to render assistance.

â€œI suppose you have now had enough of the fish?â€ remarked Glenn, as
they retraced their steps homeward.

â€œIâ€™ll acknowledge that Iâ€™m satisfied for the present; but I was
resolved to have satisfaction!â€ replied Joe.

â€œYes, but you have had it with a vengeance; and I doubt not that your
apparent contentment is but cold comfort,â€ continued Glenn.

â€œIâ€™m not a bit coldâ€”I shanâ€™t change my clothes, and Iâ€™m ready for any
other sport you like,â€ said Joe.

â€œIf you really suffer no inconvenience from the wetâ€”and this fine warm
day inclines me to believe youâ€”we will take our guns and walk out to
the small lakes on the borders of the prairie.â€

â€œSplash itâ€â€”began Joe.

â€œNoâ€”_duck_ it,â€ interrupted Glenn.

â€œWell, I should like to know exactly what you meanâ€”whether you are in
earnest about going to the ponds, or whether you are joking me for
getting _ducked_â€”as thereâ€™s nothing in them now to shoot but _ducks_,
and it may have popped into your head just because I had the
_ducking_,â€ said Joe.

â€œI am in earnest,â€ said Glenn; â€œI do not wish to annoy William, or to
meet Roughgrove and Mary until their domestic arrangements are all
completed.â€

â€œThatâ€™s strange,â€ said Joe.

â€œWhatâ€™s strange?â€ asked Glenn, quickly.

â€œWhy, your not wanting to meet Miss Mary. I say it is most mysteriously
strange,â€ replied Joe.

â€œSay nothing more about it, and think less,â€ said Glenn, striding in
advance, while a smile played upon his lip.

â€œBut I canâ€™t help dreaming about itâ€”and my dreams all come true,â€ said
Joe.

â€œWhat have you been dreamingâ€”but never mindâ€”bring out the guns,â€ said
Glenn, pausing at the gate of the inclosure, and not venturing to hear
Joe recite the dream about himself and Mary.

When possessed of the necessary implements, they set out towards the
groves that bordered the prairie, among which were several lakes of
clear water, not more than fifty or sixty paces in diameter, where the
various wild fowl, as well as the otter and the muskrat, usually
abounded. Our hero had previously anticipated some sport of this
nature, and constructed blinds on the verge of the lakes, and cut paths
through the clustering bushes to reach them stealthily. The lake they
now approached was bounded on one side by the green meadow-like
prairie, and fringed on the other by hazel thickets, with an occasional
towering elm that had survived the autumnal fires.

The morning breeze had subsided, and a delightful calm prevailed. A
thousand wild flowers, comprising every hue, filled the air with
delicious fragrance, while no sound was heard but the melody of happy
birds.

â€œI think I see a duck!â€ whispered Joe, as they moved slowly along the
path in a stooping posture.

â€œWhere?â€ asked Glenn, as they crept softly to the blind and cast their
eyes over the clear unruffled water.

â€œI thought I saw one on the muskrat house; but he must have gone to the
other side,â€ responded Joe, now looking in vain for it, and closely
scanning the little hillocks that had been thrown up in the lake by the
muskrats.

â€œYou must have been mistaken,â€ said Glenn; â€œsuppose we go to the other
lakes.â€

â€œNo, I wasnâ€™t mistakenâ€”Iâ€™d swear to itâ€”be quiet and keep a bright
look-out, and weâ€™ll see him again in a minute or two,â€ replied Joe, who
stood in an attitude of readiness to fire at an instantâ€™s warning.

â€œWhat is that?â€ asked Glenn, just then actually observing a small brown
object moving behind the hillock.

â€œWait till I see a little more of it,â€ said Joe, with his finger on the
trigger.

â€œDonâ€™t fire, Joe! its a manâ€™s _cap_!â€ exclaimed Glenn, detecting under
the dark brim the large staring eyes of a human being, apparently
evincing a sense of imminent peril; and the next moment the muzzle of a
gun pointing above their heads came in view.

â€œDod rot it, look up that tree!â€

The smile that began to play on our heroâ€™s features on recognizing the
voice of Sneak was quickly dispelled and succeeded by horror when he
cast his eyes upward and beheld an enormous panther, stooping, and on
the eve of springing upon him!

â€œOh!â€ exclaimed Joe, letting his gun fall, and falling down himself,
bereft alike of the power of escape and the ability to resist.

â€œBe quiet!â€ said Glenn, endeavouring to raise his gun, which had become
entangled in the bushes; but before he could execute his purpose Sneak
fired, and the ferocious animal came tumbling down through the branches
and fell at his feet.

â€œUgh! Goodness!â€ exclaimed Joe, his hat striken down over his eyes by
the descending panther, and, leaping over the frail barrier of bushes
into the water, he plunged forward and executed a series of diving
evolutions, as if still endeavouring to elude the clutches of the
carnivorous beast, which he imagined was after him.

[Illustration: He plunged forward.]

He plunged forward, and executed a series of diving evolutions.


â€œDodâ€”come out of the pond! Its deadâ€”didnâ€™t you hear _me_ shoot?â€ said
Sneak, who had by this time paddled a little canoe in which he had been
seated to the shore. But Joe continued his exercises, his crushed hat
not only depriving him of sight, but rendering him deaf to the laughter
that burst from Glenn and Sneak. Sneak ran round to the opposite side
of the lake to a point that Joe was approaching, (though all
unconscious of his destination,) and remained there till the poor
fellow pushed his half-submerged head against the grass, when he seized
him furiously and bore him a few paces from the water, in spite of his
cries and struggles.

â€œ_I_ ainâ€™t the painter!â€ said Sneak, at length weary of the illusion,
and dragging Joeâ€™s hat from his head.

â€œHa! hang it! ha!â€ cried Joe, staring at Sneak and Glenn in
bewilderment. â€œWhere is it?â€ he cried, when in some degree recovered
from his great perturbation.

â€œDidnâ€™t you hear _me_ shoot? Of course its dead!â€ replied Sneak.

â€œWhich do you prefer, Joe, _ducking_ or _fishing_?â€ asked Glenn.

â€œI never saw a feller _duck_ his head so,â€ said Sneak.

â€œHa! ha! ha! you thought I was frightened, and trying to get away from
the panther! But you were _much_ mistaken. I was chasing a muskratâ€”I
got wet in the river, and was determined to seeâ€”â€

â€œYou couldnâ€™t see your own nose!â€ interrupted Sneak.

â€œIf I couldnâ€™t see, I suppose I could hear him run!â€ replied Joe.

â€œYou couldnâ€™t â€™ave heard thunder!â€ said Sneak.

â€œDid you ever try it?â€ asked Joe.

â€œNo,â€ replied Sneak.

â€œThen you donâ€™t know,â€ replied Joe; â€œand now Iâ€™m ready to kill a duck,â€
he continued, looking up at a number of water-fowl sailing round and
awaiting their departure to dip into the water.

â€œI will leave you here, Joe. When you hear me fire at the other lake,
you may expect the ducks that escape me to visit you,â€ observed Glenn,
and immediately after disappeared in the bushes.

â€œAnd Iâ€™ll take the painterâ€™s hide off,â€ said Sneak, going with Joe to
the blind, where he quietly commenced his labour, that Joeâ€™s sport
might not be interrupted.

Several flocks of geese and ducks yet flew round above, and gradually
drew nearer to the earth, but still fearful of danger and cautiously
reconnoitering the premises.

â€œSuppose I pink one of them on the wing?â€ said Joe, looking up.

â€œI donâ€™t believe you _kin_,â€ said Sneak, as he tugged at the pantherâ€™s
hide.

â€œWait till they come round the next time, and Iâ€™ll show youâ€”so look
out,â€ said Joe.

â€œIâ€™ll not lookâ€”thereâ€™s no occasion for my seeingâ€”_Iâ€™m_ not after a
muskrat,â€ responded Sneak, stripping the skin from the animal, and
laughing at his own remark. When the ducks came round again, Joe fired,
and sure enough one of them fellâ€”descending in a curve which brought it
directly on Sneakâ€™s cap, knocking it over his eyes.

â€œDod rot it! hands off, or Iâ€™ll walk into you!â€ exclaimed Sneak, rising
up in a hostile attitude.

â€œGood! thatâ€™s tit for tat,â€ cried Joe, laughing, as he loaded his gun.

â€œYou didnâ€™t do it a purpose,â€ said Sneak, â€œnor I wonâ€™t jump into the
water nother.â€

â€œYes I did!â€ continued Joe, much pleased at the occurrence.

â€œYou didnâ€™t do any sich thingâ€”or weâ€™d have to fight; but nobody could
do sich a thing only by accident. Youâ€™d better load your gun, and be
ready by the time the next comes,â€ added Sneak, again tearing asunder
the pantherâ€™s skin.

â€œI thought I _had_ loaded,â€ said Joe, forgetting he had performed that
operation, and depositing another charge in his old musket.

Presently Glennâ€™s gun was heard, and in a few minutes an immense flock
of geese and ducks, mingled together, flew over the bushes and covered
the face of the lake. Joe very deliberately fired in the midst of them,
and the rebound of his gun throwing him against Sneak, who was still in
a stooping posture, they both fell to the ground.

â€œI did that on purpose, Iâ€™ll take my oathâ€”I knew you had put in two
loads,â€ said Sneak, rising up.

â€œYes, but I ainâ€™t hurtâ€”falling over you saved me, or else Iâ€™d a
thrashed you or got a thrashing,â€ replied Joe, his good humour
recovered on beholding some fifteen or twenty dead and wounded ducks
and geese on the surface of the water. By the time he had collected his
birds, by means of Sneakâ€™s canoe, Glenn, who had met with the like
success, emerged from the bushes on the opposite verge of the lake,
bearing with him his game. Being well satisfied with the sport, he and
Joe retraced their steps homeward.




CHAPTER XVII.

The bright morningâ€”Sneakâ€™s visitâ€”Glennâ€™s heartâ€”The snake huntâ€”Love and
raspberriesâ€”Joe is bittenâ€”His terror and sufferingsâ€”Arrival of
Booneâ€”Joeâ€™s abrupt recoveryâ€”Preparations to leave the westâ€”Conclusion.


The sun rose the next morning in unusual glory. Not a breath of air
stirred the entranced foliage of the dark green trees in the valleys,
and the fresh flowers around exhaled a sweet perfume that remained
stationary over them. The fawn stood perfectly still in the grassy
yard, and seemed to contemplate the grandeur of the enchanting scene.
The atmosphere was as translucent as fancy paints the realms of the
blest, and quite minute objects could be distinctly seen far over the
river many miles eastward. Nor were any sounds heard save the
occasional chattering of the paroquet in the dense forest across the
river, a mile distant, and yet they appeared to be in the immediate
vicinity. The hounds lay extended on the ground with their eyes open,
more in a listless than a watchful attitude. The kitten was couched on
the threshold (the door having been left open to admit the pure air,)
and looked thoughtfully at the rising sun. The large blue chanticleer
was balanced on one foot with an eye turned upwards as if scanning the
heavens to guard against the sudden attack of the far-seeing eagle.
Nature seemed to be indulging in a last sweet morning slumber, if
indeed not over-sleeping herself, while the sun rose stealthily up and
smiled at all her charms exposed!

â€œHillo! ainâ€™t you all up yit? Git up, Joe, and feed your hosses,â€ cried
Sneak, approaching the gate on the outside, and thus most
unceremoniously dispelling the charm that enwrapped the premises.

â€œWhoâ€™s there?â€ cried Joe, springing up and rubbing his eyes.

â€œItâ€™s meâ€”dod, you know who I am. Come, open the gate and let me in.â€

â€œWhatâ€™s the matter, Sneak? Are the Indians after you?â€ said Joe,
running out, but pausing at the gate for an answer before he drew back
the bolt.

â€œNoâ€”I thought-you had sense enough by this time to know no Indians
ainâ€™t going to come this time a-year. Let me in!â€ added he,
impatiently.

â€œWhat are you doing with them long sticks?â€ asked Joe, opening the gate
and observing two hickory poles in Sneakâ€™s hand. â€œAre you going to try
your luck fishing?â€

â€œNo, nor _ducking_ nother,â€ replied he, sarcastically.

â€œPlague it, Sneak,â€ said Joe, deprecatingly, â€œnever mind that affair;
you were mistaken about my being frightened. The next chance I get Iâ€™ll
let you see that Iâ€™m not afraid of any thing.â€

â€œWell, I want you to go with me on a spree this morning thatâ€™ll try
you.â€

â€œWhat are you going to do?â€ asked Joe, with some curiosity in his
looks.

â€œIâ€™m going a _snaking_,â€ said Sneak.

At this juncture the dialogue was arrested by the appearance of Glenn,
whose brow was somewhat paler than usual, and wore an absent and
thoughtful cast; yet his abstract meditations did not seem altogether
of a painful nature.

â€œJoe,â€ said he, â€œI want you to exercise the horses more in the prairie.
They are getting too fat and lazy. If they cannot be got on the boat
when we leave here, we will have to send them by land to St. Louis.â€

â€œDodâ€”you ainâ€™t a going to leave us?â€ cried Sneak.

â€œWell, I thought something was in the wind,â€ said Joe, pondering, â€œbut
itâ€™ll break Miss Maryâ€™sâ€”â€

â€œPshaw!â€ replied Glenn, quickly interrupting him; â€œyou donâ€™t know what
you are talking about.â€

â€œWell, I canâ€™t say I do exactly,â€ said Joe; â€œbut I know its a very
mysterious matter.â€

â€œ_What_ is such a mysterious matter?â€ asked Glenn, smiling.

â€œWhy, youâ€”Miss Maryâ€â€”stammered Joe.

â€œWell, what is there mysterious about us?â€

â€œHang it, _you_ know!â€ replied Joe.

â€œPshaw!â€ repeated Glenn, striding out of the inclosure, and descending
the path leading to Roughgroveâ€™s house, whither he directed Joe to
follow when he had galloped the horses.

â€œHave you got any licker in the house?â€ asked Sneak, staring at the
retreating form of Glenn.

â€œNoâ€”its all gone. Why do you ask?â€ returned Joe.

â€œBecaise that fellerâ€™s drunk,â€ said Sneak, with a peculiar nod.

â€œNo he ainâ€™tâ€”he hasnâ€™t drunk a drop for a month.â€

â€œThen heâ€™s going crazy, and youâ€™d better keep a sharp look-out.â€

â€œI know whatâ€™s the matter with himâ€”heâ€™s in love!â€ said Joe.

â€œThen why donâ€™t he take her?â€ asked Sneak.

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ replied Joe; â€œmaybe he will, some day. Now for a
rideâ€”how are you, Pete?â€ he continued, opening the stable door and
rubbing the ponyâ€™s head that was instantly thrust out in salutation.

â€œIâ€™ll ride the hoss,â€ said Sneak.

â€œWill you? Iâ€™m glad of it,â€ said Joe, â€œfor thatâ€™ll save me the trouble
of leading him.â€

â€œThatâ€™s jest what I come for,â€ said Sneak, â€œbecaise this hot morning
the snakes are too thick to fight â€™em on foot.â€

â€œCan you see many of them at a time?â€

â€œWell, I reckon you kin.â€

â€œWonâ€™t they bite the horses?â€

â€œNo, the hosses knows what a snake is as well as a man, and theyâ€™ll
keep a bright eye for â€™emselves, while we stave out their brains with
our poles,â€ said Sneak.

In a few minutes the companions were mounted, and with the fawn
skipping in advance, and the hounds in the rear, they proceeded gayly
out toward the prairie on a _snaking_ expedition.

The sunlight was now intensely brilliant, and the atmosphere, though
laden with the sweet perfume of the countless millions of wild flowers,
began to assume a sultriness that soon caused the horses and hounds to
loll out their tongues and pant as they bounded through the rank grass.
Ere long the riders drew near a partially barren spot in the prairie,
where from some singular cause the grass was not more than three inches
high. This spot was circular, about fifty paces in diameter, and in the
centre was a pool of bright water, some fifty feet in circumference.
The grass growing round this spot was tall and luxuriant, and
terminated as abruptly at the edge of the circle as if a mower had
passed along with his sharp scythe.

â€œSneak, I never saw that before,â€ said Joe, as they approached, while
yet some forty paces distant. â€œWhat does it mean?â€

â€œYouâ€™ll see presently,â€ said his companion, grasping more firmly the
thick end of his rod, as if preparing to deal a blow. â€œWhen I was out
here this morning,â€ he continued, â€œthey were too thick for me, and I
had to make tracks.â€

â€œWhat were too thick for you?â€ asked Joe, with a singular anxiety, and
at the same time reining in his pony.

â€œWhy, the _snakes_,â€ said Sneak with much deliberation. â€œI was a-foot
then, and from the style in which they whizzed through the grass, I was
afraid too many might git on me at a time and choke me to death. But
now Iâ€™m ready for â€™em; they canâ€™t git us if we manage korect.â€

â€œI wonâ€™t go!â€ said Joe.

â€œDod, they ainâ€™t pisen!â€ said Sneak; â€œtheyâ€™re nearly all _black
racers_, and they donâ€™t bite. Come on, donâ€™t be such a tarnation
coward; the rattlesnakes, and copper-heads, and wipers, wonâ€™t run after
us; and if they was to, they couldnâ€™t reach up to our legs. This is a
glorious day for _snaking_â€”come on, Joe!â€

Joe followed at a very slow and cautious pace a few steps farther, and
then halted again.

â€œWhatâ€™re you stopping for agin?â€ asked Sneak.

â€œSneak, the pony ainâ€™t tall enough!â€

â€œThatâ€™s all the better,â€ replied Sneak; â€œyou can whack â€™em easier as
they runâ€”and then they canâ€™t see you as fur as they kin me. Iâ€™ll swap
hosses with you.â€

â€œNo you wonâ€™t!â€ replied Joe, whipping forward again. But he had not
advanced many seconds before he drew up once more. This time he was
attracted by the unaccountable motions of the fawn, a short distance
ahead. That animal was apparently striking some object on the ground
with its feet, and ever and anon springing violently to one side or the
other. Its hair stood erect on its back, and it assumed a most
ferocious aspect. Now it would run back toward the men a moment, and,
wheeling suddenly, again leap upon the foe, when its feet could be
heard to strike against the ground; then it plunged forward, and after
making a spring beyond, would return to the attach.

â€œHere, Ringwood! Jowler!â€ cried Joe, and the hounds ran forward to the
spot pointed out to them. But no sooner had they gone far enough to see
the nature of the enemy that the fawn was attacking, than they turned
away affrighted, and with their tails hanging down retreated from the
scene of action.

They rode up and surveyed more closely the strange battle. The fawn,
becoming more and more enraged, did not suspend hostilities at their
approach. They paused involuntarily when, within a few feet of the
object, which proved to be a tremendous rattlesnake, some five feet in
length, and as thick as a manâ€™s arm. It was nearly dead, its body,
neck, and head, exhibited many bloody gashes cut by the sharp hoofs of
the fawn. Every time the fawn sprang upon it, it endeavoured in vain to
strike its fangs into its active foe, which sprang away in a twinkling,
and before it could prepare to strike again, the fatal hoofs would
inflict another wound on its devoted head. It grew weaker and weaker,
and finally turned over on its back, when the infuriated deer, no
longer compelled to observe cautionary measures, soon severed its head
entirely from the body and stood over it in triumph.

[Illustration: It grew weaker and weaker, and finally turned over on
its back.]


â€œPete can do that if a deer can!â€ said Joe, somewhat emboldened at the
death of so formidable a reptile, and beholding the fixed though
composed gaze of the pony as he stood with his head turned sideways
towards the weltering snake.

â€œSartinly he kin,â€ said Sneak, standing up in his stirrups, and
stretching his long neck to its utmost tension to see if any snakes
were in the open area before them.

â€œDo you see any, Sneak?â€ asked Joe, now grasping his rod and anxious
for the fray.

â€œI see a fewâ€”about forty, I guess, lying in the sun at the edge of the
water.â€

â€œSneak, thereâ€™s too many of them,â€ said Joe.

â€œDodâ€”you ainâ€™t a going to back out now, I hope. Donâ€™t you see your pony
snuffing at â€™em? He wants to dash right in among â€™em.â€

â€œNo he donâ€™t,â€ said Joeâ€”â€œhe donâ€™t like the smell, nor I eitherâ€”faugh!â€

â€œWhy, it smells like May-applesâ€”I like it,â€ said Sneak; â€œbut there
ainâ€™t more than one or two copper-heads thereâ€”theyâ€™re most all racers.
Come on, Joeâ€”we must gallop right through and mash their heads with our
sticks as we pass. Then after a little while we must turn and dash back
aginâ€”thatâ€™s the way to fix â€™em.â€

â€œYou must go before,â€ said Joe.

The number that Sneak mentioned was not exaggerated. On the contrary,
additions were constantly made to the number. The surface of the pool
was continually agitated by the darting serpents striking at the
tadpoles and frogs, while on the margin many were writhing in various
fantastic contortions in their sports. Nearly all of them were large,
and some could not have been less than eleven feet long. They were
evidently enjoying the warm rays of the sun, and at times skipped about
with unwonted animation. Now one of the largest would elevate his black
head some four feet from the ground, while the others wrapped
themselves around him, and thus formed the dark and horrid spectacle of
a pyramid of snakes! Then falling prostrate with their own weight, in
less than a twinkling they were dispersed and flying over the smooth
short grass in every direction, their innumerable scales all the time
emitting a low buzzing sound as they ran along. Every moment others
glided into the area from the tall grass, and those assembled thither
rushed towards them in a body to manifest a welcome.

â€œNowâ€™s the time!â€ cried Sneak, rushing forward, followed by Joe. When
Joeâ€™s eyes fell upon the black mass of serpents, he made a convulsive
grasp at the reins with an involuntary resolution to retreat without
delay from such a frightful scene. But the violence of his grasp
severed the reins from the bit, and the pony sprang forward after the
steed, being no longer subject to his control! There was no retreating
now! Sneak levelled his rod at a cluster just forming in a mass two
feet above the ground, and crushed the hydra at a blow! Joe closed his
eyes, and struck he knew not whatâ€”but Sneak knew, for the blow
descended on his headâ€”though with feeble force. In an instant the
horsemen had passed to the opposite side of the area and halted in the
tall grass. Looking back, they beheld a great commotion among the
surviving snakes. Some glided into the pool, and with bodies submerged,
elevated their heads above the surface and darted out their tongues
fiercely. Others raced round the scene of slaughter with their heads
full four feet high, or gathered about the dead and dying, and lashed
the air with their sharp tails, producing sounds like the cracking of
whips. The few copper-heads and rattlesnakes present coiled themselves
up with their heads in the centre in readiness to strike their poison
into whatever object came within their reach.

So sudden had been the onset of the horsemen that the surprised
serpents seemed to be ignorant of the nature of the foe, and instead of
flying to the long grass to avoid a recurrence of bloodshed, they
continued to glide round the pool, while their number increased every
moment.

â€œWhatâ€™d you hit me on the head for?â€ asked Sneak, after regarding the
snakes a moment, and then turning to Joe, the pony having still kept at
the heels of the steed in spite of his riderâ€™s efforts to the contrary.

â€œOh, Sneak,â€ cried Joe, in tones somewhat tremulous, â€œdo, for goodnessâ€™
sake, let us go away from here!â€

â€œI shaâ€™nâ€™t do any such thingâ€”whatâ€™d you hit me on the head for?â€

â€œI thought I was a killing a snake,â€ replied Joe.

â€œDo I look like a snake?â€ continued Sneak, turning round, when for the
first time he discovered the condition of his companionâ€™s bridle.

â€œSneak, letâ€™s ride away!â€ said Joe.

â€œAnd leave all them black sarpents yander poking out their tongues at
us? I wonâ€™t go till I wear out this pole on â€™em. Ha! ha! ha! I thought
you hadnâ€™t spunk enough to gallup through â€™em on your own accord,â€ said
Sneak, looking at the pony, and knowing that he would follow the steed
always, if left to his own inclination.

â€œCome, Sneak, letâ€™s go home!â€ continued Joe, in a supplicating tone.

â€œCome! letâ€™s charge on the snakes agin!â€ said Sneak, raising the rod,
and fixing his feet in the stirrups.

â€œHang me if I go there again!â€ said Joe, throwing down his rod.

â€œYouâ€™re a tarnation coward, thatâ€™s what you are! But you canâ€™t help
yourself,â€ replied Sneak.

â€œIâ€™ll jump off and run!â€ said Joe, preparing to leap to the ground.

â€œYou jest do now, and youâ€™ll have forty sarpents wrapped round you in
less than no time.â€

At that moment two or three racers swept between them with their heads
elevated as high as Joeâ€™s knees, and entered the area.

â€œOh goodness!â€ cried Joe, drawing up his legs.

â€œGit down and git your pole,â€ said Sneak.

â€œI wouldnâ€™t do it if it was made of gold!â€

â€œIf you say youâ€™ll fight the snakes, Iâ€™ll git it for youâ€”Iâ€™m a going to
stay here till theyâ€™re all killed,â€ continued Sneak.

â€œGive it to me, thenâ€”Iâ€™ll smash their brains out the next time!â€ said
Joe, with desperate determination.

â€œBut you musnâ€™t hit me agin!â€ said Sneak, dismounting and handing up
the weapon to Joe, and then leaping on the steed again.

â€œSneak, youâ€™re no better than a snake, to bring me into such a scrape
as this!â€ said Joe, leaning forward and scanning the black mass of
serpents at the pool.

In a few minutes they whipped forward, Sneak in advance, and again they
were passing through the army of snakes. This time Joe did good
service. He massacred one of the coiled rattlesnakes at a blow, and his
pony kicked a puffing viper to atoms. Sneak paused a moment at the
pool, and dealt his blows with such rapidity that nearly all the black
racers that survived glided swiftly into the tall grass, and one of the
largest was seen by Joe to run up the trunk of a solitary blasted tree
that stood near the pool, and enter a round hole about ten feet from
the ground.

But if the serpents were mostly dispersed from the area around the
pool, they were by no means all destroyed; and when the equestrians
were again in the tall grass, they found them whizzing furiously about
the hoofs of their horses. Once or twice Sneakâ€™s horse sprang suddenly
forward in pain, being stung on the ham or shoulder by the tails of the
racers as they flew past with almost inconceivable rapidity.

â€œOh! St. Peter! Sneak!â€ cried Joe, throwing back his head, and lifting
up his knees nearly to his chin.

â€œHa! ha! ha! did one of â€™em cut you, Joe? They hurt like fury, but
their tails ainâ€™t pisen. Look what a whelk theyâ€™ve made on the hoss.â€

â€œSneak, why donâ€™t you get away from this nasty place! One of them shot
right over the ponyâ€™s neck a while ago, and came very near hitting me
on the chin.â€

â€œYou must hit â€™em as they come. Yander comes oneâ€”now watch me!â€ Saying
this, Sneak turned the steed so as to face a tremendous racer about
forty paces distant, that was approaching with the celerity of the wind
with its head above the tall grass. When it came within reach of his
rod, he bestowed upon it a blow that entirely severed the head, and the
impetus with which it came caused the body to fly over the steed, and
falling upon the neck of the pony, with the life yet remaining (for
they are constrictors,) instantly wrapped in a half dozen folds around
it! Pete snorted aloud, and, springing forward, ran a hundred paces
with all the fleetness of which he was capable. But being unable to
shake off the terrible incumbrance, with his tongue hanging out in
agony, he turned back and ran directly for the horse. When he came up
to the steed, he pushed his head under his neck, manifesting the
greatest distress, and stamping and groaning as if becoming crazed.

â€œDod! let me git hold of him!â€ cried Sneak, bending forward and seizing
the snake by the tail. The long head-less body gave way gradually, and
becoming quite relaxed fell powerless and dead to the earth.

â€œOh, Sneak, letâ€™s go!â€ said Joe, trembling, his face having turned as
pale as death while Pete was dashing about in choking agony under the
tight folds of the serpent.

â€œSmash me if I go as long as thereâ€™s a snake left!â€ replied Sneak,
striking down another huge racer; but this one, having its back broken,
remained stationary.

Thus he continued to strike down the snakes as long as any remained on
the field; and, as they became scarce, Joe grew quite valorous, and did
signal service. At length the combat ceased, and not a living serpent
could be seen running.

â€œSneak, weâ€™ve killed them allâ€”huzza!â€ cried Joe, flourishing his rod.

â€œYes, but you didnâ€™t do muchâ€”youâ€™re as big a coward as ever.â€

â€œOh, I wasnâ€™t _afraid_ of them, Sneak,â€ said Joe; â€œI was only a little
cautious, because it was the first time I ever went a snaking.â€

â€œYes, you was mighty cautious! if your bridle hadnâ€™t broke, youâ€™d have
been home long ago.â€

â€œPshaw, Sneak!â€ said Joe; â€œyouâ€™re much mistaken. But how many do you
think weâ€™ve killed?â€

â€œI suppose about a quarter of a cordâ€”but Iâ€™ve heard tell of menâ€™s
killing a cord a day, easy.â€

â€œYou donâ€™t say so! But how does it happen so many are found together?
When I go out I can never find more than a dozen or so.â€

â€œThereâ€™s a _snake den_ under that clear place,â€ said Sneak, â€œwhere they
stay all winterâ€”but its not as big a den as some Iâ€™ve seen.â€

â€œI donâ€™t want to see more than I have to-day!â€ said Joe, whipping past
the steed as they started homewards, having mended his bridle. But as
he paced along by the decayed tree mentioned above, he saw the
glistening eyes of the large racer peering from the hole it had
entered, and he gave it a smart blow on the head with his rod and
spurred forward. The next moment, when Sneak came up, the enraged
serpent sprang down upon him, and in a twinkling wound himself tightly
round his neck! Sneakâ€™s eyes started out of his head, and being nearly
strangled he soon fell to the earth. Joe looked on in amazement, but
was too much frightened to assist him. And Sneak, unable to ask his
aid, only turned his large eyes imploringly towards him, while in
silence he vainly strove to tear away the serpent with his fingers. He
thrust one hand in his pocket for his knife, but it had been left
behind! He then held out his hand to Joe, and in this dumb and piteous
manner begged him to lend him his knife. Joe drew it from his pocket,
but could not brace his nerves sufficiently to venture within the
suffocating manâ€™s reach. At length he bethought him of his pole, and
opening the blade thrust it in the end of it and cautiously handed it
to Sneak. Sneak immediately ran the sharp steel through the many folds
of the snake, and it fell to the ground in a dozen pieces! The poor
manâ€™s strength then completely failed him, and he rolled over on his
back in breathless exhaustion. Joe rendered all the assistance in his
power, and his companion soon revived.

â€œDod rot your skin!â€ exclaimed Sneak, getting up and seizing Joe by the
collar.

â€œHang it, it wasnâ€™t _me_! it was the _snake!_â€ said Joe, extricating
his neck from his companionâ€™s grasp.

â€œWhatâ€™d you _hit_ the sarpent for?â€

â€œWhy, I wanted to kill him.â€

â€œThen why didnâ€™t you help me to get it away from my neck?â€

â€œYou didnâ€™t _ask_ me,â€ said Joe, with something like ingenuousness,
though with a most provoking application.

â€œI couldnâ€™t speak! The tarnation thing was squeezing my neck so tight I
couldnâ€™t say a word. But I _looked_ at you, and you might â€™ave
understood me. Never mind, youâ€™ll git a snake hold of you some of these
days.â€

â€œIâ€™ll keep a sharp look out after this,â€ said Joe. â€œBut Sneak, Iâ€™ll
swear now you were not born to be hung.â€

â€œYou be dod rot!â€ replied Sneak, leaping on the steed, and turning
towards the river.

â€œI would have cut him off myself, Sneak,â€ said Joe, musing on the odd
affair as they rode briskly along, â€œif I hadnâ€™t been afraid of cutting
your throat. I knew you wasnâ€™t born to be hung.â€

â€œHa! ha! ha! that was the tightest place that ever I was in,â€ said
Sneak, regaining his good humour, and diverted at the strange
occurrence.

â€œDidnâ€™t he bite you?â€ asked Joe.

â€œNo, a black snake canâ€™t biteâ€”they havnâ€™t got any fangs. If it had been
a rattlesnake or a viper, Iâ€™d been a gone chicken. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll
ever leave my knife behind again, even if I wasnâ€™t to go ten steps from
home. Dodâ€”my neckâ€™s very sore.â€

The companions continued the rest of the way in silence. When they
reached home, and returned the horses to the stable, they proceeded
down the path to Roughgroveâ€™s house to report their adventure.

Glenn and Mary, William and La-u-na, were seated under the spreading
elm-tree, engaged in some felicitous conference, that produced a most
pleasing animation in their features.

Mary immediately demanded of Joe a recital of his adventures that
morning. He complied without reluctance, and his hearers were
frequently convulsed with laughter as he proceeded, for he added many
embellishments not narrated by the author. Sneak bore their merriment
with stoical fortitude, and then laughed as heartily as themselves at
his own recent novel predicament.

La-u-na asked Sneak if he had been bitten by any of the poisonous
snakes. Sneak of course replied in the negative, but at the same time
desired to know the name of the plant that was used by the Indians with
universal success when wounded by the fangs of the rattlesnake. The
girl told him it was the _white plantain_ that grew in the prairies.

â€œIâ€™ll go and get some right straight,â€ said Joe, â€œbecause I donâ€™t know
what moment I may be bitten.â€

â€œNever mind it, Joe,â€ said Glenn, rising. â€œWe are now going to gather
wild raspberries on the cliff south of and we want you and Sneak to
assist us.â€

â€œWellâ€”I like raspberries, and they must be ripe by this time, if the
chickens havnâ€™t picked them all before us.â€

â€œDodâ€”if the chickens have ett â€™em can that make â€™em _green_ agin?â€
replied Sneak to Joeâ€™s Irishism.

â€œYouâ€™d better learn how to read before you turn critic,â€ said Joe,
taking up the baskets that had been brought out of the house. He then
led the way, quarrelling all the time with Sneak, while Glenn, placing
Maryâ€™s arm in his, and William imitating the example, followed at a
distance behind.

When the party reached the raspberry thicket, they found truly that the
fowls were there before them, though quite an abundance of the
delicious berry still remained untouched. A few moments sufficed to
drive the feathered gatherers away, and then without delay they began
to fill their baskets.

Many were the hearty peals of joyous laughter that rang from the
innocent lovers while momentarily obscured by the green clustering
bushes. Ere long they were dispersed in various parts of the thicket,
and Glenn and Mary being separated from the rest, our hero seized the
opportunity to broach a tender subject.

â€œMary,â€ said he, and then most unaccountably paused.

â€œWell,â€ said she turning her glorious dark blue eyes full upon him.

â€œI have something of moment to say to you, if you will listen
attentivelyâ€”and I know not a more fitting time and place than this to
tell it. Here is a natural bower surrounded by sweet berries, and
shielded from the sun by the fragrant myrtle. Let us sit on this mossy
rock. Will you listen?â€ he continued, drawing her close to his side on
the seat in the cool retreat.

â€œHave I ever refused to listen to you? do I not love to hear your
voice?â€ said the confiding and happy girl.

â€œBless you, Maryâ€”my whole heart is yours!â€ exclaimed our hero, seizing
a rapturous kiss from the coral lips of the maiden. Mary resisted not,
nor replied; while tears, but not of grief, glistened on her dark
lashes.

â€œYou will not reject my love, Mary? Why do you weep?â€

â€œIt is with joyâ€”my heart is so happy that tears gush out in spite of
me!â€

â€œWill you then be mine?â€ continued Glenn, winding his arm round her
yielding waist.

â€œForever!â€ she replied, and, bowing her head slightly, a shower of dark
silken tresses obscured her blushing face, and covered our heroâ€™s
panting breast. Thus they remained many moments in silence, for their
feelings were too blissful for utterance.

â€œAre you always happy, Mary?â€ said Glenn, at length, taking her little
white hand in his.

â€œNo!â€ she replied, with a sigh.

â€œWhy?â€

â€œWhen you are away, I sometimes fear the Indiansâ€”or a snakeâ€”orâ€”or
something may harm you,â€ said she, falteringly.

â€œI thank thee, Mary, for thinking of me when I am away.â€

â€œI always think of thee!â€ said she.

â€œAlways, Mary?â€

â€œAy, by dayâ€”and thou art ever with me in my dreams.â€

â€œAnd I _will_ be with thee always!â€

â€œDo!â€ said she.

â€œBut dost thou not sometimes repine that thy life is thus spent in the
wilderness far from the busy world?â€

â€œI sometimes wish I could see the beautiful cities I read ofâ€”but when I
think of the treacheries and miseries of the world, I look at the pure
fresh flowers, and list to the sweet birds around me, and then I think
there is more happiness to be enjoyed here than anywhere else.â€

â€œAnd such is truly the case,â€ said Glenn, pondering â€œBut then, Mary, we
all have obligations to discharge. We were created for societyâ€”to
associate with our species, and while mingling with kindred beings, it
is our duty to bestow as many benefits on them as may be within the
scope of our power.â€

â€œYou think, then, we should leave our western home?â€ she asked, with
undisguised interest.

â€œWilt thou not consent to go?â€

â€œIf you go, I will go!â€ said she.

â€œAnd now I declare I will not go unless thou art willing.â€

â€œBut is it a _duty_?â€ she asked.

â€œYour faâ€”Mr. Roughgrove says so.â€

â€œThen let us go! But why did you not say _father_?â€

â€œHe is not your father.â€

â€œNo!â€ exclaimed the maid, turning pale.

â€œI will tell thee all, Mary.â€ And Glenn related the story of the
maidenâ€™s birth. â€œNow, Mary,â€ he continued, â€œthou knowest thine own
history. Thou art of a noble race, according to the rules of menâ€”nay,
thy blood is royalâ€”if thou wouldst retract thy plighted faith (I should
have told thee this before,) speak, and thy will shall be done!â€

â€œOh! Charles! I am thine, THINE ONLY, were I born an angel!â€ she cried,
throwing herself into his arms. At this juncture a violent rustling was
heard in the bushes not far distant, and the next moment Joeâ€™s voice
rang out.

â€œOh me! Oh St. Peter! Oh murder! murder! murder!â€ cried he. Instantly
all the party were collected round him. He lay in a small open space on
the grass, with his basket bottom upward at his side, and all the
berries scattered on the ground.

â€œWhat is the matter?â€ asked Glenn.

â€œOh, Iâ€™m snake-bitten! Iâ€™m a dead man! Iâ€™m dying!â€ cried he, piteously.

â€œThatâ€™s a fib,â€ said Sneak, â€œbekaise a dead man canâ€™t be a dying.â€

â€œLet me see,â€ said William, stooping down to examine the place on which
Joeâ€™s hands were convulsively pressed. With some difficulty he pulled
them away, and tearing down the stocking, actually saw a small bleeding
puncture over the ankle bone!

â€œWhat kind of a snake was it?â€ asked Glenn in alarm. â€œA
rattlesnakeâ€”Oh!â€

â€œDid you _see_ it?â€ continued Glenn, knowing Joeâ€™s foible, though it
was apparent he suffered from some kind of a wound.

â€œI heard it rattle. Oh, my goodness! Iâ€™m going fast! Iâ€™m turning
blind!â€

La-u-na told him to run to the house and cover the wound with salt, and
remain quiet till Sneak could obtain some plantain leaves from the
prairie. Joe sprang up and rushed down the hill. Sneak set out in quest
of the antidote, and the rest directed their steps homeward.

When they reached Roughgroveâ€™s house, they found Joe lying in the
middle of the floor on his back, and groaning most dolefully. He had
applied the salt to the wound as directed, and covered it and his whole
leg so plentifully with bandages that the latter seemed to be as thick
as his body.

â€œHow do you feel now, Joe?â€ asked Glenn.

â€œIâ€™m a dead man!â€ said he.

La-u-na told him not to be alarmed, and assured him there was no
danger.

â€œBut Iâ€™ll die before Sneak can get back!â€

â€œYour voice is too strong to fear that,â€ said William; â€œbut do you
suffer much pain?â€

â€œOh, Iâ€™m in agony!â€ said he, rolling back his eyes.

â€œWhere does the pain lie?â€ asked Glenn.

â€œOh, St. Peter! all over me! In my toes, ankles, legs, arms, heart,
throat, mouth, nose, and eyes! Oh, Iâ€™m in tortures! Iâ€™m blindâ€”I canâ€™t
see any of you!â€

At this moment Roughgrove, who had been over the river on a visit to
Boone, entered the apartment with the renowned hunter at his side. When
fully informed of the circumstances, Boone stooped down and felt Joeâ€™s
pulse.

â€œThe strokes are irregular,â€ said Boone.

â€œOh heaven!â€ exclaimed Joe.

â€œBut that may be caused by fright,â€ continued Boone.

â€œOh goodness! it ainâ€™t thatâ€”Iâ€™m a dying man!â€

â€œIs the leg much swollen?â€ asked Boone, endeavouring to ascertain
without taking off the bandages.

â€œOh! oh! donâ€™t do that! itâ€™ll kill me in a minuteâ€”for its swelled fit
to burst!â€ cried Joe, shrinking from Booneâ€™s grasp.

â€œAll the cases of snake-bite that I have seen differ from this. I have
always found the swollen limb nearly devoid of feeling. Did you kill
the snake?â€

â€œNoâ€”Oh!â€

â€œTell me precisely the place where you were standing when it bit
youâ€”there is a mystery about it that I must solve.â€

â€œOhâ€”it wasâ€”I canâ€™t speak! my breathâ€™s going fast! Oh! Paternosterâ€”â€

William then described the spot to Boone in such precise terms that the
old woodman declared he would immediately repair thither and endeavour
to find the snake. He accordingly set out in the direction indicated
without further delay; while Roughgrove, believing that poor Joe was
really on the verge of eternity, strove to comfort his departing spirit
with the consolation that religion affords.

â€œOh! that ainâ€™t the right one!â€ exclaimed Joe, pushing away the
Episcopal prayer-book held by Roughgrove.

â€œThen here is one you cannot object to,â€ said Roughgrove, opening the
Bible.

â€œOh, thatâ€™s not it, either!â€ cried Joe, in great distress. â€œIs there no
priest in this region? Iâ€™m a Roman Catholicâ€”oh!â€

â€œCan you not confess your sins _directly_ to Godâ€”the God who is
everywhere, and governs all things?â€ said the aged man, impressively,
and with animation.

â€œI have prayed,â€ said Joe; â€œbut now I want the ointment!â€

â€œYour body, which must be placed in the damp cold earth, needs no oil.
It is far better to purify the soul, which perishes not,â€ said
Roughgrove, in fervent and tremulous tones.

â€œOh!â€”Oh! Ugh!â€ cried Joe, in a deep guttural voice, and turning over on
his face. His fears had evidently been increased by the solemn tone and
look of Roughgrove.

â€œDonâ€™t be alarmed, Joe,â€ said Glenn, turning him again on his back.
â€œSneak will soon be here, and La-u-na says the plantain will be sure to
cure you. William tells me that he has seen the Indians permit the
snakes to bite them for a mere trifle in money, so certain were they of
being restored by the plant. And indeed he never knew a bite to
terminate fatally.â€

â€œBut Iâ€™m afraid Sneak wonâ€™t come in time,â€ replied Joe, somewhat
comforted.

â€œPshaw! he wonâ€™t loiter in a case of this kindâ€”he knows it is no joke,â€
continued Glenn.

â€œBut suppose he canâ€™t _find_ any plantainâ€”then Iâ€™m dead to a certainty!
Oh me!â€

â€œDoes the pain increase much?â€ asked Mary.

â€œOh, yes! its ten times worse than it was ten minutes ago! Iâ€™m going
fastâ€”I canâ€™t move either leg now,â€ he continued, in a weak utterance.

Glenn grew uneasy. Joe was paleâ€”very pale, and breathed hard.

Boone entered, with a smile on his lip.

â€œHave you got the plantain?â€ asked Joe, in feeble accents, with his
languid eyes nearly closed, thinking it was Sneak.

â€œSit up and tell me how you feel,â€ said Boone, in vain striving to
repress his smile.

â€œOh, St. Peter! I havenâ€™t strength enough to lift my hand,â€ said Joe,
his eyes still closed.

â€œDid you find the snake?â€ asked Glenn.

â€œYes,â€ replied Boone. Joe groaned audibly. â€œI will tell you all about
it,â€ he continued; â€œI found the spot where Joe had been gathering the
berries, and tracked him without difficulty to every bush he visited by
the bruised grass under his foot-prints. At length I came to the
cluster of bushes where he received the wound. I stood in his cracks
and saw where he had plucked the raspberries. When about to cast down
my eyes in quest of the snake, suddenly I felt a blow on my own ankle!â€

â€œDid the same snake bite you?â€ asked Mary, quickly.

â€œYes,â€ replied Boone, still smiling. Joe opened his eyes, and after
gazing a moment at Boone, asked him if he did not suffer much pain.

â€œFully as much as you doâ€”but hear me through. I sprang back with some
violence, I admit, but I did not run away. Lifting my cane, I returned
with a determination to kill the snake. I stooped down very low to
ascertain the precise position of its head, which was concealed by a
large mullen leafâ€”I saw its eyes and its _bill_â€”â€

â€œWhat!â€ exclaimed Joe, rising up on his elbow with unwonted vigour, and
his eyes riveted on the speaker.

â€œYes, its _bill_â€, continued Boone. â€œAnd while my cane was brandished
in the air and about descending on its devoted head, a low clucking
arrested my arm, and approaching closer to it than before, and gazing
steadfastly a moment, I lowered my cane to its usual position, and fell
back laughing on the grass among the raspberries you had dropped.â€

â€œMr. Booneâ€”Mr. Boone!â€ cried Joe, springing up in a sitting attitude,
and seizing the hand of the veteran, â€œfor Heavenâ€™s sake tell me what it
was?â€

â€œIt was an old SITTING HEN!â€ said Boone.

â€œUpon your honour?â€ continued Joe, leaping upon his feet, and staring
the aged hunter in the face, while his eyes gleamed with irrepressible
hope and anxiety.

â€œIt was nothing else, upon my honour,â€ replied Boone, laughing in
concert with the rest.

â€œHuzza! huzza!! huzza!!!â€ shouted Joe, casting the bandages hither and
thither, and dancing nimbly over the floor. â€œFal-de-lalâ€”tider-e-iâ€”
tider-e-oâ€” tider-e-um!â€ he continued, in frenzied delight, and,
observing Sneak at the door with an armful of plantain (who had
returned in time to witness his abrupt recovery, and now continued to
regard him with wonder and doubtâ€”at times thinking he was delirious,)
skipped up and held out both hands, as if inviting him to dance.

â€œDod rot it, your leg ainâ€™t swelled a bit!â€ said Sneak.

â€œDonâ€™t use that bad word, Sneak,â€ said Mary.

â€œI wonâ€™tâ€”but dodâ€”heâ€™s had me running all overâ€”â€

â€œTider-e-iâ€”tider-e-um!â€ continued Joe, still dancing, while the
perspiration streamed over his face.

â€œHave done with this nonsense, Joe!â€ said Glenn, â€œor else continue your
ridiculous exercises on the grass in the yard. You may rejoice now, but
this affair will be sport for others all your life. You will not relish
it so much to-morrow.â€

â€œIâ€™d rather all the world would laugh at me alive and kicking, than
that one of you should mourn over my dead body,â€ replied Joe, leaping
over Sneak, who was sitting in the door, and striding to the grass plot
under the elm, where he continued his rejoicings. Sneak followed, and,
sitting down on the bench in the shade, seemed to muse with unusual
gravity at the strange spectacle presented by Joe.

This was Joeâ€™s last wild western adventure. The incident was soon
forgotten by the party in the house. Serious and sad thoughts succeeded
the mirthful scene described above. Roughgrove had brought Boone
thither to receive their last farewell! The renowned woodman and
warrior wore marks of painful regret on his pale features. The rest
were in tears.

â€œWilliam,â€ said Roughgrove, â€œlisten to a tale concerning thy birth and
parentage, which I feel it to be my duty to unfold. Your sister has
already learned the story from your friend, who sits beside her. But I
will repeat it to all present. You who are the most interested can then
determine whether it shall ever be disclosed to other ears. The secret
was long locked in my bosom, and it was once my purpose to bury it with
my body in the grave. I pondered long on the subject, and prayed to
Heaven to be instructed. I have satisfactory evidence in my own heart
that I have acted correctly.â€ He then related the history of the twins,
as we have given it to the reader. When he concluded, La-u-na, who had
betrayed much painful interest during the recital, threw her arms round
Williamâ€™s neck, and wept upon his breast.

â€œWhy do you weep, La-u-na?â€ asked the youth.

â€œLa-u-na must die!â€ said she; â€œher William will leave her and forget
her. The wild rose will bend over her graveâ€”the brook will murmur low
at her cold feetâ€”the rabbit will nip the tender grass by her tombstone
at night-fallâ€”the katydid will chirp over her, and the whippor-will
will sing in vain. William will forget her! Poor La-u-na!â€

â€œNoâ€”La-u-na! no! Thou shalt go with me and be my bride, or else I will
remain with thee! Death only shall separate us!â€ said the youth,
drawing the slight form of the Indian maiden closer to his heart, and
imprinting a rapturous kiss on her smooth forehead.

â€œWe will all go together,â€ continued Roughgrove, â€œsave our beloved
friend here, who tells me that no earthly consideration could induce
him to dwell in cities among civilized men.â€

â€œTrue,â€ said Boone; â€œI would not exchange my residence in the western
wilds for the gorgeous palaces of the east. Yet I think you do right in
returning to the society which you were destined to adorn. I shall
grieve when I miss you, but I will not persuade you to remain. Every
one should act according to the dictates of his conscience. It is my
belief that Providence guides our actions. You, my friends, were fitted
and designed to move in refined society, and by your example and
influence to benefit the world around you. The benefits bestowed by
_me_ will not be immediate, nor altogether in my day. I am a PIONEER,
formed by nature. Where I struggle with the savage and the wild beast,
my great grandchildren will reside in cities, I must fulfil my
mission.â€

At this moment Joe and Sneak appeared at the door.

â€œThereâ€™s a covered flat-boat just landed down at the ferry,â€ said Joe.

â€œIt is from the island above,â€ said Roughgrove, â€œand the one I have had
constructed for our voyage down the river.â€

â€œAre we going, sure enough?â€ asked Joe.

â€œYes; to-morrow,â€ said Glenn.

â€œDodâ€”are you _all_ going off?â€ asked Sneak, rolling round his large
eyes, and stretching out his neck to an unusual length.

â€œAll but me, Sneak,â€ said Boone.

â€œAnd you wonâ€™t be any company for me. Dodâ€”Iâ€™ve a notion to go too! If I
could foller any thing to make a living in Fillydelfaâ€”â€

â€œIf you go with us, you shall never wantâ€”I will see that you are
provided for,â€ said Glenn.

â€œItâ€™s a bargain!â€ said Sneak, with the eager emphasis characteristic of
the trading Yankee.

â€œBut poor Peteâ€”the horses!â€ said Joe.

â€œThere are stalls in the boat for them,â€ said Roughgrove.

â€œHuzza! Iâ€™m glad. Huzza!â€ cried Joe.


The next morning beamed upon them in beautyâ€”and in sadness. The sun
rose in majesty, and poured his brilliant and inspiring rays on peak
and valley and plain. But the hearts of the peaceful wanderers throbbed
in sorrow as they gazed for the last time on the scene before them.
Though it had been identified with the many perilous and painful
encounters with savages, yet the quivering green leaves above, the
sparkling brook below, and the soft melody of happy birds around, were
intimately associated with some of the most blissful moments of their
lives.

La-u-na retired to a lonely spot, and poured forth a farewell song to
the whispering spirits of her fathers. Long her steadfast gaze was
fixed on the blue sky, as if communing with the departed kings from
whom she descended. At length her tears vanished like a shower in the
sunshine, and a bright smile rested upon her features, as if her prayer
had been heard and all she asked were granted! Prophetic vision! While
the race from which she separated is doomed to extinction in the
forest, the blood she mingled with the Anglo-Saxon race may yet be
destined to sway the councils of a mighty empire.

William mused in silence, guarding at a distance the bride of his
heart, and not venturing to intrude upon her devotions. The past was
like a dream to himâ€”the present a bright visionâ€”the future a paradise!

Glenn and Mary were seated together, regarding with impatience the
brief preparations to embark. Boone, Roughgrove, Sneak, and Joe were
busily engaged lading the vessel. Sneak had hastily brought thither his
effects, and without a throe of regret abandoned his _house_ for ever
to the owls. Joe succeeded with but little difficulty in getting the
horses on board. The fawn, the kitten, the hounds, and the chickens
were likewise taken along.

And now all was ready to push out into the current. All were on board.
Boone bid them an affectionate adieu in silenceâ€”in silence, but in
tears. The cable was loosened, and the boat was wafted down on its
journey eastward. William and La-u-na sat upon the deck, and gazed at
the receding shore, rendered dear by hallowed recollections. Glenn and
Mary stood at the prow, and as they marked the fleeting waters, their
thoughts dwelt on the happy future. Roughgrove was praying. Joe was
caressing the pony. Sneak was counting his muskrat skins. And thus we
must bid them adieu.



THE END.

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

PROLOGUE


Upon a paper attached to the Narrative which follows, Doctor Hesselius
has written a rather elaborate note, which he accompanies with a
reference to his Essay on the strange subject which the MS.
illuminates.

This mysterious subject he treats, in that Essay, with his usual
learning and acumen, and with remarkable directness and condensation.
It will form but one volume of the series of that extraordinary manâ€™s
collected papers.

As I publish the case, in this volume, simply to interest the â€œlaity,â€
I shall forestall the intelligent lady, who relates it, i
